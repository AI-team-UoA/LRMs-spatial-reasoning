PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this step by step.

First, let's understand what we know:
- Region x is NW of region y (x NW y)
- Region y is NE of region z (y NE z)

We want to determine the possible relations between regions x and z.

From the definitions:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x NW y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y NE z)

From these, we can't directly determine a relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(z) and infx(x). We know both x and z are to the left and right of y, respectively, but we can't say for sure how they relate to each other horizontally.

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NE z)

Combining these: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
This means: supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

So we know that z is below x in terms of y-coordinates. But for x-coordinates, we need to explore different scenarios.

Scenario 1: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
This would mean that x is to the left of z. Combined with supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we have x NW z.

Scenario 2: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
This would mean that z is to the left of x. Combined with supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we have x NE z.

Scenario 3: If they overlap in x-coordinates (neither supx(x) ≤ infx(z) nor supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
But we still have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x N z.

Actually, I need to be more careful here. I need to check if my conclusion in Scenario 3 is correct. Let's define what x N z means:

x N z if and only if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

In Scenario 3, we're saying that x and z overlap in x-coordinates, but that doesn't necessarily mean that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Let me reconsider.

Actually, let's think about it more generally. What are the possible relations between x and z given what we know?

From x NW y and y NE z, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

These directly give us: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, region z is below region x in terms of y-coordinates.

But for x-coordinates, we just know that both x and z are to the left of y, but we don't know how they relate to each other.

Now, let's consider all possible cardinal direction relations and check which ones are consistent with supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and our other knowledge:

1. x N z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The first part is consistent, but we don't know about the x-coordinate relationship.

2. x NE z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The second part is consistent, and the first part is possible if z is to the left of x.

3. x E z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z and x can't overlap in y-coordinates, so this is inconsistent.

4. x SE z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is inconsistent.

5. x S z: This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z) AND infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   Again, from supy(z) ≤ infy(x), this is inconsistent.

6. x SW z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) AND supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   From supy(z) ≤ infy(x), this is inconsistent.

7. x W z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) AND infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z and x can't overlap in y-coordinates, so this is inconsistent.

8. x NW z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) AND supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The second part is consistent, and the first part is possible if x is to the left of z.

9. x B z: This means infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z) AND infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z and x can't overlap in y-coordinates, so this is inconsistent.

Actually, I seem to be making a mistake in reasoning. Let me double-check the definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

Actually I'm having a hard time clearly reasoning about this. Let me take a graphical approach and visualize the potential locations of x, y, and z as bounding boxes in a 2D space.

Let me establish a coordinate system. Since I know that x NW y and y NE z, I can place these regions in a 2D space.

If y is at position (y_infx, y_infy, y_supx, y_supy), then:
- x must be to the NW of y, which means x's bounding box must be entirely in the region where x-coordinates are less than y_infx and y-coordinates are greater than y_supy.
- z must be to the SW of y, which means z's bounding box must be entirely in the region where x-coordinates are less than y_infx and y-coordinates are less than y_infy.

Hmm, I just realized my mistake. It's actually incorrect to say "z must be to the SW of y". From y NE z, we know that z is to the SW of y, not the other way around.

Let me correct this: 
- If y is at position (y_infx, y_infy, y_supx, y_supy), then:
  - x must be to the NW of y, which means x's bounding box must be entirely in the region where x-coordinates are less than y_infx and y-coordinates are greater than y_supy.
  - z must have y to its NE, which means z's bounding box must be entirely in the region where x-coordinates are less than y_infx and y-coordinates are less than y_infy.

Now, given the positions of x and z, I need to determine the possible relations between them.

From x NW y and y NE z, we can infer that:
- x is located in the quadrant to the NW of y.
- z is located in the quadrant to the SW of y.

So, in terms of y-coordinates, x is above y, which is above z. This means x is definitely above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).

In terms of x-coordinates, both x and z are to the left of y, but we don't know their horizontal relationship with each other.

Let's consider different scenarios for the horizontal relationship between x and z:

1. If x is to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)):
   Combined with x being above z, this would make the relation x NW z.

2. If z is to the left of x (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)):
   Combined with x being above z, this would make the relation x NE z.

3. If x and z overlap horizontally, then depending on the specific overlap, we could have different relations:
   - If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then combined with x being above z, the relation would be x N z.
   
   Actually, I need to be careful here. The definition of x N z is:
   x N z if and only if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   
   So, for the relation to be x N z, z's x-extent must completely contain x's x-extent.

   - If x's x-extent contains z's x-extent, then the relation can't be any of the defined cardinal directions. Let's see:
     If infx(x) ≤ infx(z) AND supx(z) ≤ supx(x) AND supy(z) ≤ infy(x), this doesn't match any of the given cardinal direction relations.
   
   - If x's and z's x-extents partially overlap, this doesn't match any of the given cardinal direction relations either.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The definitions of the cardinal directions are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. For any two distinct regions, exactly one of the 9 basic cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) must hold.

Given that x is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), the relation can't be S, SE, or SW. Also, it can't be E, W, or B because these require overlap in y-coordinates, which our constraint doesn't allow.

So, the possible relations between x and z can only be N, NE, or NW.

Now, let me double-check if N is truly a possibility. For x N z, we need:
1. supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z) - This is satisfied from our derivation.
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of or on x's left edge)
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of or on z's right edge)

From conditions 2 and 3, z's x-extent must contain x's x-extent. Given the constraints from x NW y and y NE z, it's not clear if this is always possible. Let's see:

- From x NW y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
- From y NE z, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

So, both supx(x) and supx(z) are less than or equal to infx(y). This doesn't give us a direct comparison between supx(x) and supx(z). Similarly, we don't have a direct comparison between infx(x) and infx(z).

Actually, let's think about it differently. Given a 2D space, imagine a grid divided by the lines corresponding to y_infx, y_supx, y_infy, and y_supy. This creates a 3x3 grid of 9 regions. Now, from x NW y and y NE z, we know:
- x is entirely in the top-left region of the grid.
- y is entirely in the central region of the grid.
- z is entirely in the bottom-left region of the grid.

With this visualization, it's clear that x must be to the north of z in this grid. But, depending on the specific positions of x and z within their respective grid cells, x could be directly north, northeast, or northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

Actually, there's another way to look at this. Let's just track the constraints on points.

Given:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These give us:
- Both x and z are to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
- x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- y is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y))

Transitively, x is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

But we don't have direct constraints on the horizontal relationship between x and z. Both are to the left of y, but they could be horizontally organized in various ways.

If the horizontal constraint is that x is to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), then we have the cardinal relation x NW z.

If the horizontal constraint is that z is to the left of x (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), then we have the cardinal relation x NE z.

If the horizontal constraint is that z's x-extent contains x's x-extent (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), then we have the cardinal relation x N z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

Actually, I just realized there could be other horizontal relationships between x and z, such as a partial overlap or x's x-extent containing z's x-extent. For completeness, let's check if these could lead to any of the other 9 cardinal directions.

Hmm, wait I just realized something. If region x is NW of region y, it only means that region x is located in the NW tile defined by the bounding box of region y. Similarly, if region y is NE of region z, it means region y is in the NE tile defined by the bounding box of region z.

I need to reconsider my approach. Let's think of each region as having a bounding box:

- Region x is NW of region y: This means x is entirely in the NW tile defined by y's bounding box. In other words, x is to the left and above y.
- Region y is NE of region z: This means y is entirely in the NE tile defined by z's bounding box. In other words, y is to the right and above z.

Now, I want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Given:
- x is to the left and above y (x NW y)
- y is to the right and above z (y NE z)

I can infer:
- x is above y and y is above z, so x is definitely above z.
- x is to the left of y and z is to the left of y, so the horizontal relationship between x and z is not directly constrained.

If x is to the left of z, then combined with x being above z, we have x NW z.
If z is to the left of x, then combined with x being above z, we have x NE z.
If x and z have the exact same horizontal extent, then combined with x being above z, we have x N z.

Actually, me and my attempt to simplify might not be very clear. Let's go back to the formal definitions, but I'll try to analyze it more methodically.

Given:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

We want to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

From the above, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

Combining these, we can infer:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z.

Now, given that x is above z, the possible cardinal relations between x and z are limited. Let's check each:

- x N z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
  The first condition is satisfied. For the others, we need z's x-extent to contain x's x-extent, which is possible.

- x NE z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
  The second condition is satisfied. For the first, we need z to be to the left of x, which is possible.

- x E z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z and x don't overlap in y-coordinates. This contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x E z is not possible.

- x SE z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
  We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x SE z is not possible.

- x S z: This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z) AND infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
  We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x S z is not possible.

- x SW z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) AND supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
  We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

- x W z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) AND infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z and x don't overlap in y-coordinates. This contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x W z is not possible.

- x NW z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) AND supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
  The second condition is satisfied. For the first, we need x to be to the left of z, which is possible.

- x B z: This means infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z) AND infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z and x don't overlap in y-coordinates. This contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x B z is not possible.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

Actually, let me triple check this. Let's be very precise about the definitions.

x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Given these, we want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the above, we can infer:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

Transitively, we can determine:
- x is above z (from supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). This means cardinal directions where x is below z (S, SE, SW) are ruled out, and the ones where x and z have overlapping y ranges (B, W, E) are also ruled out. The possible directions are N, NE, and NW.

Let me double-check each of these:

- x N z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
  We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x) from our derived constraint.
  We don't have direct constraints on infx(z) vs. infx(x) or supx(x) vs. supx(z).
  But it's possible for z's x-extent to contain x's x-extent, so x N z is a possibility.

- x NE z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
  We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x) from our derived constraint.
  We don't have a direct constraint on supx(z) vs. infx(x).
  But it's possible for z to be to the left of x, so x NE z is a possibility.

- x NW z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) AND supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
  We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x) from our derived constraint.
  We don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) vs. infx(z).
  But it's possible for x to be to the left of z, so x NW z is a possibility.

Actually, I think my analysis is correct this time:
The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

Hmm wait, one more thing: could the regions overlap (i.e., could the relation be B)? Let me think about this: 

x B z means: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z) AND infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x) from our derived constraint. But for B relation, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), there's a contradiction: we can't have supy(x) ≤ supy(z) because that would imply supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is contradictory (supy(x) ≤ infy(x) is not valid for a region x). So, x B z is not possible.

Actually, I think I need to be more specific about the reasoning. 

Let me break down the constraint we've derived: supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

This means that the uppermost point of region z is below the lowermost point of region x. In other words, regions x and z are completely separated in the y-direction, with x being entirely above z.

Now, for the relation x B z, one of the conditions is supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This means the uppermost point of region x is below or at the same level as the uppermost point of region z.

But if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've derived), and if regions are non-empty (which is implied), then infy(x) < supy(x) (the lowermost point of x is below the uppermost point of x). Combining these, we get:

supy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(x)

Which gives us supy(z) < supy(x), which directly contradicts the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) required for x B z. Thus, x B z is not a possible relation.

Similarly, I can rule out x E z and x W z:

For x E z, one of the conditions is infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This requires some overlap in the y-direction, which contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

For x W z, the reasoning is the same: one of the conditions is infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts our derived constraint.

Actually, I think our conclusion is correct. The possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW. These are the relations where x is strictly above z, and they differ in the horizontal relationship between x and z.

Let me double-check by drawing out the constraints:
- x NW y: x is in the NW quadrant of y's bounding box.
- y NE z: y is in the NE quadrant of z's bounding box.

Given this, the possible positions of x relative to z are:
- x directly above z (N)
- x to the right and above z (NE)
- x to the left and above z (NW)

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

Actually, let me think about this from the beginning. I'm going to reason more rigorously about the problem.

Given:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

We can infer a few things from these constraints:
1. x is to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))
2. x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
3. z is to the left of y (supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
4. z is below y (supy(z) ≤ infy(y))

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z by checking the constraints for each relation:

a. supy(z) ≤ infy(x): From 2 and 4, we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means x is definitely above z.

b. Given a, only relations where x is above z are possible: N, NE, NW. Let's check each:

- N: We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means z's x-extent contains x's x-extent. Given that both x and z are to the left of y, this is a possibility.

- NE: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means z is to the left of x. This is not directly constrained by our given relations, so it's a possibility.

- NW: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. Again, this is not directly constrained, so it's a possibility.

All other relations (E, SE, S, SW, W, B) are not possible because they either require x to be below z or for x and z to overlap in the y-direction, both of which contradict the constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

In conclusion, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

Actually, let me think about this from a more visual perspective, just to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Picture this: We have region y at the center. Region x is to the top-left (NW) of y, and region z is to the bottom-left (SW) of y.

Given this arrangement, region x is definitely above region z. But the horizontal relationship between x and z is not constrained. For example, x could be directly above z (N), to the right of z (NE), or to the left of z (NW).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, and NW.

Actually, I realized I misinterpreted the relation y NE z. If y is to the NE of z, then z is to the SW of y, not the "bottom-left" as I said. Let me correct this.

Picture this: We have region y at the center. Region x is to the top-left (NW) of y, and region z has y to its top-right (NE), which means z is to the bottom-left (SW) of y.

Given this arrangement, region x is definitely above region z, as I've deduced from the formal constraints. But the horizontal relationship between x and z is not directly constrained. They could be arranged in various ways horizontally.

OK let me think about it visually again:
- If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
  - x is in the NW quadrant, so its sup points are bounded: supx(x) ≤ 0 and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
  - z has y in its NE, so z's sup points are bounded: supx(z) ≤ 0 and supy(z) ≤ 0.

Let me plot some point coordinates to clarify this:
- y could be a region around (0, 0), with corners at (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, 1), and (1, -1).
- x, being NW of y, could be a region with corners at (-3, 3), (-3, 5), (-2, 5), and (-2, 3).
- z, having y to its NE, could be a region with corners at (-5, -5), (-5, -3), (-3, -3), and (-3, -5).

In this example, the relation between x and z is NW, because supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

But I can also place x in a different position, for instance:
- x could be a region with corners at (-3, 5), (-3, 7), (-1, 7), and (-1, al5). Now, the relation between x and z is N because infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Or another position for x:
- x could be a region with corners at (-1, 3), (-1, 5), (0, 5), and (0, 3). With this, the relation between x and z is NE because supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, and NW. This aligns with my formal deduction.

In conclusion, the answer to the the question is: the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

I need to determine what cardinal direction relation(s) could exist between region x and region z.

From the definitions:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can infer:
1. x is to the left of y (from x NW y)
2. x is above y (from x NW y)
3. z is to the left of y (from y NE z)
4. z is below y (from y NE z)

Combining these facts, especially (2) and (4), we can deduce:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Therefore supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is definitely above z.

The horizontal relationship between x and z is not directly constrained - they are both to the left of y but could be positioned in different ways relative to each other.

The possible relations are:
- N (if z's x-extent contains x's x-extent)
- NE (if z is to the left of x)
- NW (if x is to the left of z)
