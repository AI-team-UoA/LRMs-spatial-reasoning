PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's solve this step-by-step using the given definitions of cardinal direction relations.

We are told that:
1. Region x is N of region y. This means that supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
2. Region y is E of region z. This means that supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's analyze what we know:
- From (1), supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From (2), supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- From (1) and (2), we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which implies that infy(x) <= supy(z) is possible but not necessary. However, it doesn't establish a definite relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

- From (1) and (2), we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(y), which gives us supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). So, supx(z) <= infx(x).

Now, let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z based on the constraints we've derived:

1. N (North): For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for the N relation. Hence, x cannot be strictly N of z.

2. NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the NE relation.
   - We haven't established a definite relationship between supy(z) and infy(x), so it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x), which would make NE a possible relation.

3. E (East): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the E relation.
   - From (2), we know that infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't have a direct relation between infy(y) and infy(x). So, infy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
   - Similarly, we don't have a direct relation between supy(x) and supy(z). So, supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible.
   - Given these, E is a possible relation.

4. SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the SE relation.
   - From (1), we know that supy(y) <= infy(x), and from (2), we know that infy(z) <= infy(y). This doesn't give us a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z). So, supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible.
   - Given these, SE is a possible relation.

5. S (South): For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for the S relation. Hence, x cannot be S of z.

6. SW (South West): For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means that infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= infx(z) for the SW relation. Hence, x cannot be SW of z.

7. W (West): For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Similar to SW, this contradicts our established constraint that supx(z) <= infx(x). Hence, x cannot be W of z.

8. NW (North West): For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Similar to W, this contradicts our established constraint that supx(z) <= infx(x). Hence, x cannot be NW of z.

9. B (bounding box): For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for the B relation. Hence, x cannot be B of z.

Wait, I realize that my reasoning has some issues. Let me reconsider the constraints more carefully.

From the given conditions:
1. x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
2. y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let's combine these:
- From (1) and (2), we get supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means supy(y) is a lower bound for both infy(x) and supy(z), but it doesn't establish a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).
- From (1) and (2), we get infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(y). This gives us supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x).
- From (1) and (2), we get supx(x) <= supx(y) and no direct relation between supx(y) and supx(z). So, there's no clear relation between supx(x) and supx(z).
- From (1) and (2), we get no direct relation between infy(x) and infy(y), and infy(z) <= infy(y). So, there's no clear relation between infy(x) and infy(z).

The only definite relationship we can establish is supx(z) <= infx(x).

Given this constraint, let's reconsider the possible cardinal direction relations:

1. NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the NE relation.
   - The relation between supy(z) and infy(x) is not definitively established by the given conditions, so it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Given these, NE is a possible relation.

2. E (East): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the E relation.
   - The relations between infy(z) and infy(x), and between supy(x) and supy(z), are not definitively established by the given conditions, so both infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are possible.
   - Given these, E is a possible relation.

3. SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the SE relation.
   - The relation between supy(x) and infy(z) is not definitively established by the given conditions, so it's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Given these, SE is a possible relation.

It seems like the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE based on the given conditions.

Actually, hold on. I think I need to be more careful. Let me re-analyze this from the beginning.

From the given conditions:
1. x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
2. y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let's see what these conditions tell us about the relation between x and z:

- From (1) and (2), we get supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means that supy(y) is both less than or equal to infy(x) and less than or equal to supy(z). But it doesn't give a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

- From (1) and (2), we get infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(y). This gives us supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x).

- From (1) and (2), we get supx(x) <= supx(y) and no direct relation between supx(y) and supx(z). So, there's no clear relation between supx(x) and supx(z).

- From (1) and (2), we get no direct relation between infy(x) and infy(y), and infy(z) <= infy(y). So, there's no clear relation between infy(x) and infy(z).

- From (1) and (2), we get no direct relation between supy(x) and supy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z). So, there's no clear relation between supy(x) and supy(z).

Let's go through the cardinal direction relations one by one to see which ones are possible:

1. N (North): For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - From the analysis, we don't have direct constraints on supy(z) and infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
   - We don't have direct constraints on infx(z) and infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
   - We don't have direct constraints on supx(x) and supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z) is possible.
   - Given that all three conditions for the N relation can be satisfied based on the given constraints, N is a possible relation.

2. NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the NE relation.
   - From the analysis, we don't have direct constraints on supy(z) and infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
   - Given these, NE is a possible relation.

3. E (East): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the E relation.
   - From the analysis, we don't have direct constraints on infy(z) and infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
   - We don't have direct constraints on supy(x) and supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible.
   - Given these, E is a possible relation.

4. SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the SE relation.
   - From the analysis, we don't have direct constraints on supy(x) and infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible.
   - Given these, SE is a possible relation.

5. S (South): For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - From the analysis, we don't have direct constraints on supy(x) and infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible.
   - We don't have direct constraints on infx(z) and infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
   - We don't have direct constraints on supx(x) and supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z) is possible.
   - Given that all three conditions for the S relation can be satisfied based on the given constraints, S is a possible relation.

Actually, I realized a mistake again. Let me re-analyze this once more with more careful consideration of the constraints.

From the given conditions:
1. x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
2. y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let's analyze the positions of the regions in the x and y coordinates separately.

For the x-coordinate:
- From (1), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). This means that the projection of x on the x-axis is (possibly) a subset of the projection of y on the x-axis.
- From (2), supx(z) <= infx(y). This means that z is entirely to the left of y on the x-axis.

Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). This means that z is entirely to the left of x on the x-axis. This eliminates the possibility of x being in relations W, NW, SW, B, or S with respect to z, because all of these would require x to be at least partially to the left of or aligned with z on the x-axis.

For the y-coordinate:
- From (1), supy(y) <= infy(x). This means that y is entirely below x on the y-axis.
- From (2), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means that y is (possibly) inside z or aligned with it on the y-axis.

Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This gives us infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). But this doesn't establish a clear relation between infy(x) and supy(z).

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We haven't established a clear relation between supy(z) and infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x), in which case x would be NE of z.

2. E (East): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We've established that infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't have a direct relation between infy(y) and infy(x). It's possible that infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We haven't established a clear relation between supy(x) and supy(z). It's possible that supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - If both infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are true, then x would be E of z.

3. SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We haven't established a clear relation between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), in which case x would be SE of z.

Let's double check the North relation:

For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- From the analysis, we established that supx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for the N relation. Hence, x cannot be N of z.

Let's double check the South relation:

For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- From the analysis, we established that supx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for the S relation. Hence, x cannot be S of z.

So, based on the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE.

Actually, hold up. I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me be even more careful and go through the definitions again.

The cardinal direction relation is determined by the relative positions of the minimum bounding boxes of the regions. The minimum bounding box of a region is the smallest rectangle (with sides parallel to the x and y axes) that contains the region.

From the given conditions:
1. x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
2. y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let's analyze the relative positions:

For the x-coordinate:
- From (1), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). This means that the projection of x on the x-axis is (possibly) a subset of the projection of y on the x-axis.
- From (2), supx(z) <= infx(y). This means that z is entirely to the left of y on the x-axis.

Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). This means that z is entirely to the left of x on the x-axis. This constraint aligns with the NE, E, and SE relations.

For the y-coordinate:
- From (1), supy(y) <= infy(x). This means that y is entirely below x on the y-axis.
- From (2), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means that y is (possibly) inside z or aligned with it on the y-axis.

Combining these, we get supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't give us a definitive relation between infy(x) and supy(z), or between supy(x) and infy(z). So, based on the y-coordinate, x can be above, below, or overlap with z.

Given these constraints, let's re-evaluate the possible relations:

1. N (North): For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). This means that supx(z) <= supx(x) is false, which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for the N relation. Hence, x cannot be N of z.

2. NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We haven't established a definitive relation between supy(z) and infy(x), so it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Given these, NE is a possible relation.

3. E (East): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We've established that infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't have a direct relation between infy(y) and infy(x). It's possible that infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We haven't established a definitive relation between supy(x) and supy(z), so it's possible that supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Given these, E is a possible relation.

4. SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We haven't established a definitive relation between supy(x) and infy(z), so it's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Given these, SE is a possible relation.

5. S (South): For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). This means that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) is contradicted, which means infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) cannot hold simultaneously. Hence, x cannot be S of z.

6. SW (South West): For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). Given that infx(z) <= supx(z) (which is true for any region), we get infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This means that supx(x) <= infx(z) cannot hold. Hence, x cannot be SW of z.

7. W (West): For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Similar to SW, we've established that infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which means that supx(x) <= infx(z) cannot hold. Hence, x cannot be W of z.

8. NW (North West): For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Similar to W, we've established that infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which means that supx(x) <= infx(z) cannot hold. Hence, x cannot be NW of z.

9. B (bounding box): For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). Given that infx(x) <= supx(x) (which is true for any region), we get supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). This contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for the B relation. Hence, x cannot be B of z.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE.

Actually, let me re-consider the North case again. I'm not sure I have been thinking about this clearly.

For x to be N of z, we need:
supy(z) <= infy(x)
infx(z) <= infx(x)
supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). This means supx(z) is to the left of infx(x) on the number line. Since infx(x) is to the left of supx(x) (by definition), we've got supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). But this contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for the N relation, which would imply supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which is a contradiction.

So, x cannot be N of z, which confirms our earlier conclusion.

Let's double check the other direction, too.

For x to be S of z, we need:
supy(x) <= infy(z)
infx(z) <= infx(x)
supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). This means supx(z) is to the left of infx(x) on the number line. Since infx(x) is to the left of supx(x) (by definition), we've got supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). But this contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for the S relation.

So, x cannot be S of z, which again confirms our earlier conclusion.

Let's summarize:

From the given conditions:
1. x is N of y: This means y is below x, and the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of y.
2. y is E of z: This means y is to the right of z, and the y-projection of y is within the y-projection of z.

The key constraint we've derived is that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is entirely to the left of x on the x-axis.

Given this, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. NE (North East): If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NE of z.
2. E (East): If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.
3. SE (South East): If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z.

These are the only possible relations given the constraints.

Wait, I'm noticing I didn't fully account for the E relation where we the region needs to be strictly to the right of the reference but with some overlap in the y-axis.

Let's double-check the E relation against our conclusions:
For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This is consistent with our derived constraint.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): We have infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is E of z) and no clear relation between infy(y) and infy(x), so this is possible.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): We have supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y is E of z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x is N of y). This gives supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). But this doesn't directly establish a relation between supy(x) and supy(z), so this condition is possible.

Therefore, E remains a possible relation between x and z, which is consistent with our earlier conclusion.

I think the correct answer is that the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE. But let me make one final check to be sure.

First, let's establish what we definitively know:

- x is N of y
- y is E of z
- From these, we can conclude:
  - supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is E of z)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is N of y)
  - Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is entirely to the left of x on the x-axis.
  - supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x is N of y)
  - infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is E of z)
  - supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y is E of z)
  - From these, we can infer that y is below x and y is within z's vertical extent. But this doesn't establish a direct relationship between x and z in terms of their vertical positions.

Next, let's consider each possible cardinal direction relation between x and z:

1. N: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

2. NE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have supx(z) <= infx(x). 
   - The vertical relationship between x and z is not definitively established by the given conditions, so supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
   - Thus, NE is a possible relation.

3. E: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We have supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We have infy(z) <= infy(y), but the relationship between infy(y) and infy(x) is not definitively established. So, infy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
   - The relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) is not definitively established. So, supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible.
   - Thus, E is a possible relation.

4. SE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We have supx(z) <= infx(x). 
   - The relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) is not definitively established. So, supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible.
   - Thus, SE is a possible relation.

5. S: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

6. SW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We have supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(z) <= supx(z) (which is true for any region), we have infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). This contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. W: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= infx(z) for the W relation. So, x cannot be W of z.

8. NW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= infx(z) for the NW relation. So, x cannot be NW of z.

9. B: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for the B relation. So, x cannot be B of z.

Based on this comprehensive analysis, the only possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE.

Let me visualize a concrete example for each of these relations to confirm:

1. NE (North East):
   - Let z be at coordinates (0, 0) to (1, 1).
   - Let y be at coordinates (2, 0) to (3, 1).
   - Let x be at coordinates (2, 2) to (3, 3).
   - Here, y is E of z and x is N of y. And x is NE of z.

2. E (East):
   - Let z be at coordinates (0, 0) to (1, 3).
   - Let y be at coordinates (2, 1) to (3, 2).
   - Let x be at coordinates (2, 3) to (3, 4).
   - Here, y is E of z and x is N of y. And x is E of z.

3. SE (South East):
   - Let z be at coordinates (0, 3) to (1, 4).
   - Let y be at coordinates (2, 1) to (3, 2).
   - Let x be at coordinates (2, 0) to (3, 1).
   - Here, y is E of z and x is N of y. And x is SE of z (which seems contradictory, let me check this).

Wait, the SE example I provided doesn't work. If x is N of y, then supy(y) <= infy(x). But in the example, y is at (2, 1) to (3, 2) and x is at (2, 0) to (3, 1), which means supy(y) = 2 and infy(x) = 0, and thus supy(y) > infy(x). This contradicts the definition of x being N of y.

Let me revise my SE example:

3. SE (South East):
   - Let z be at coordinates (0, 3) to (1, 4).
   - Let y be at coordinates (2, 0) to (3, 1).
   - Let x be at coordinates (4, 0) to (5, 1).

Wait, that doesn't work either. If x is N of y, then x should be above y, not to the right of it.

I think there might be an issue with my understanding of the problem. Let me re-read the definitions of the cardinal directions.

According to the definitions provided:
- x is N of y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
- y is E of z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let me try to create a concrete example to check my understanding.

For x to be N of y:
- y should be below x (supy(y) <= infy(x)).
- x should be within the horizontal extent of y (infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)).

For y to be E of z:
- y should be to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(y)).
- y should be within the vertical extent of z (infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)).

Given these, let's construct an example:
- Let z be at coordinates (0, 0) to (2, 5).
- Let y be at coordinates (5, 1) to (8, 3).
- Let x be at coordinates (6, 6) to (7, 7).

Let's check if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 5, so supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 0, infy(y) = 1, so infy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- supy(y) = 3, supy(z) = 5, so supy(y) <= supy(z). ✓
Yes, y is E of z.

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 3, infy(x) = 6, so supy(y) <= infy(x). ✓
- infx(y) = 5, infx(x) = 6, so infx(y) <= infx(x). ✓
- supx(x) = 7, supx(y) = 8, so supx(x) <= supx(y). ✓
Yes, x is N of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 6, so supx(z) <= infx(x). ✓
- supy(z) = 5, infy(x) = 6, so supy(z) <= infy(x). ✓
This corresponds to the NE relation. So, x is NE of z in this example.

Let's create another example to check the E relation:
- Let z be at coordinates (0, 0) to (2, 8).
- Let y be at coordinates (5, 3) to (8, 6).
- Let x be at coordinates (6, 6) to (7, 7).

Let's check if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 5, so supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 0, infy(y) = 3, so infy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- supy(y) = 6, supy(z) = 8, so supy(y) <= supy(z). ✓
Yes, y is E of z.

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 6, infy(x) = 6, so supy(y) <= infy(x). ✓
- infx(y) = 5, infx(x) = 6, so infx(y) <= infx(x). ✓
- supx(x) = 7, supx(y) = 8, so supx(x) <= supx(y). ✓
Yes, x is N of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 6, so supx(z) <= infx(x). ✓
- infy(z) = 0, infy(x) = 6, so infy(z) <= infy(x). ✓
- supy(x) = 7, supy(z) = 8, so supy(x) <= supy(z). ✓
This corresponds to the E relation. So, x is E of z in this example.

Let's also create an example to check the SE relation:
- Let z be at coordinates (0, 8) to (2, 10).
- Let y be at coordinates (5, 3) to (8, 5).
- Let x be at coordinates (6, 0) to (7, 2).

Let's check if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 5, so supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 8, infy(y) = 3, so infy(z) <= infy(y). ⨯

This doesn't work. Let me revise the example:
- Let z be at coordinates (0, 0) to (2, 8).
- Let y be at coordinates (5, 3) to (8, 5).
- Let x be at coordinates (6, 0) to (7, 2).

Let's check if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 5, so supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 0, infy(y) = 3, so infy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- supy(y) = 5, supy(z) = 8, so supy(y) <= supy(z). ✓
Yes, y is E of z.

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 5, infy(x) = 0, so supy(y) <= infy(x). ⨯

This doesn't work either. If x is N of y, then x should be above y, but I'm trying to place x below y to achieve the SE relation with z. I think I've made a mistake in my understanding or in how I'm constructing these examples.

Actually, I'm confused again by the definition of North. Let me check it one more time:

x is N of y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).

supy(y) <= infy(x) means that the highest point of y is below the lowest point of x. This implies that y is below x, which is indeed north of y.
infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) means that the horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of y.

So, if x is N of y, then y is below x, and the horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of y.

Ok, I think I misunderstood the third example. Let's try again.

For x to be N of y:
- y should be below x (supy(y) <= infy(x)).
- x should be within the horizontal extent of y (infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)).

For y to be E of z:
- y should be to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(y)).
- y should be within the vertical extent of z (infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)).

Let's create a concrete example for the SE relation:
- Let z be at coordinates (0, 6) to (2, 10).
- Let y be at coordinates (5, 3) to (8, 5).
- Let x be at coordinates (6, 0) to (7, 2).

Let's check if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 5, so supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 6, infy(y) = 3, so infy(z) <= infy(y). ⨯

This doesn't work. For y to be E of z, y needs to be within the vertical extent of z, but in this example, y is below z. Let's adjust the coordinates.

- Let z be at coordinates (0, 0) to (2, 10).
- Let y be at coordinates (5, 3) to (8, 5).
- Let x be at coordinates (6, 0) to (7, 2).

Let's check if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 5, so supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 0, infy(y) = 3, so infy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- supy(y) = 5, supy(z) = 10, so supy(y) <= supy(z). ✓
Yes, y is E of z.

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 5, infy(x) = 0, so supy(y) <= infy(x). ⨯

This doesn't work either. If x is N of y, then y should be below x, but I'm trying to place x below y to achieve the SE relation with z. Let's adjust.

- Let z be at coordinates (0, 0) to (2, 10).
- Let y be at coordinates (5, 3) to (8, 5).
- Let x be at coordinates (6, 6) to (7, 8).

Let's check if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 5, so supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 0, infy(y) = 3, so infy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- supy(y) = 5, supy(z) = 10, so supy(y) <= supy(z). ✓
Yes, y is E of z.

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 5, infy(x) = 6, so supy(y) <= infy(x). ✓
- infx(y) = 5, infx(x) = 6, so infx(y) <= infx(x). ✓
- supx(x) = 7, supx(y) = 8, so supx(x) <= supx(y). ✓
Yes, x is N of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 6, so supx(z) <= infx(x). ✓
- infy(z) = 0, infy(x) = 6, so infy(z) <= infy(x). ✓
- supy(x) = 8, supy(z) = 10, so supy(x) <= supy(z). ✓
This corresponds to the E relation, not the SE relation as I was aiming for.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused by the terminology. With these directional predicates, I'm describing the position of the first argument relative to the second argument. So, for "x is N of y", it means x is positioned to the north of y, which implies that x is above y. 

Let me make one more attempt for the SE relation:
- Let z be at coordinates (0, 5) to (2, 10).
- Let y be at coordinates (5, 0) to (8, 3).
- Let x be at coordinates (6, 4) to (7, 5).

Let's check if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 5, so supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 5, infy(y) = 0, so infy(z) <= infy(y). ⨯

This doesn't work.

I'm facing difficulties constructing an example for the SE relation without contradicting the given conditions. Let me re-evaluate my approach and understanding of the problem.

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake in how I'm interpreting the SE relation or in how I'm constructing the examples.

Let me step back and think about this conceptually. If x is N of y and y is E of z, then:
- x is above y.
- y is to the right of z.

Given these, where can x be relative to z?
- x could be to the northeast of z (NE).
- x could be to the east of z (E).
- But it's hard to see how x could be to the southeast of z (SE) given that x is above y and y is to the right of z. This would place x to the right and possibly below z.

I think my conclusion that the SE relation is possible between x and z might be incorrect. Let me review the derivation for the SE relation.

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
- We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x).
- For supy(x) <= infy(z) to hold, the highest point of x needs to be below the lowest point of z.

Given that x is N of y (so x is above y) and y is E of z (so y is to the right of z), the SE relation between x and z would mean that:
- x is above y.
- y is to the right of z.
- x is to the right and below z.

This seems contradictory. If x is above y and y is above z, then x should be above z, not below it.

I am having trouble seeing how x can be SE of z given the other two constraints. Let's analyze it algebraically.

x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x).
y is E of z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining these, we get supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This gives us infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). Since infy(z) <= infy(x), it's not clear that supy(x) <= infy(z).

Given the algebraic analysis, I still can't rule out the possibility of the SE relation. But intuitively, it seems unlikely.

After careful consideration, I'm inclined to believe that the possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

Wait, let me carefully reason about this again. For the SE relation, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). For this to be consistent with the given conditions, the following must hold:
- x is N of y:
  * supy(y) <= infy(x) (y is below x).
  * infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's horizontal extent is within y's).
- y is E of z:
  * supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z).
  * infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's vertical extent is within z's).

We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies the first condition for SE. But for the second condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the highest point of x needs to be below the lowest point of z.

Now, let's try to reason about the vertical positioning:
- From y is E of z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
- From x is N of y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).

While we can establish that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we can't directly establish a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), but it's also possible that infy(z) <= supy(x).

So, after re-evaluating, I believe the SE relation is possibly consistent with the given constraints.

I'm revisiting my earlier conclusion. Based on the constraints from the given conditions, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE.

Actually, maybe one last check. Let me a construct concrete example for the SE relation and triple-check whether it satisfies all the constraints:

Let's try:
- z: (0, 10) to (2, 15)
- y: (4, 5) to (8, 8)
- x: (5, 0) to (7, 3)

Checking if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 10, infy(y) = 5. So, infy(z) <= infy(y). ⨯

This doesn't work.

Let's try again:
- z: (0, 5) to (2, 15)
- y: (4, 7) to (8, 10)
- x: (5, 1) to (7, 3)

Checking if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 5, infy(y) = 7. So, infy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- supy(y) = 10, supy(z) = 15. So, supy(y) <= supy(z). ✓
Yes, y is E of z.

Checking if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 10, infy(x) = 1. So, supy(y) <= infy(x). ⨯

This doesn't work for the SE relation.

Let me try differently:
- z: (0, 10) to (2, 15)
- y: (4, 0) to (6, 5)
- x: (5, 6) to (6, 8)

Checking if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 10, infy(y) = 0. So, infy(z) <= infy(y). ⨯

This doesn't work either.

This is puzzling. I'm not able to find a concrete example for the case where x is SE of z, given the constraints that x is N of y and y is E of z. This contradicts my algebraic reasoning, where I couldn't rule out the SE relation.

Let me revisit my understanding of the SE relation in the context of the given constraints:

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This means that x is to the right of and below z.

Given that x is N of y (so x is above y) and y is E of z (so y is to the right of z), placing x to the right of and below z seems contradictory.

I believe the SE relation is actually inconsistent with the given constraints, and the possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful with the vertical components and keep track of them: from the premise, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) (from 'y is E of z') and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from 'x is N of y'). We can chain these together to get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). So we know infy(z) <= infy(x).

Additionally, from 'y is E of z', we get supy(y) <= supy(z). But we can't derive a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z) from the given conditions. So, the SE relation seems algebraically consistent with the premises.

Let me try one more concrete example for the SE relation:

- z: (0, 5) to (2, 15)
- y: (4, 1) to (6, 4)
- x: (5, 7) to (6, 9)

Checking if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 5, infy(y) = 1. So, infy(z) <= infy(y). ⨯

This still doesn't work. For y to be E of z, y's vertical extent should be within z's, which means infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let me try once more:
- z: (0, 0) to (2, 10)
- y: (4, 3) to (6, 7)
- x: (5, 20) to (6, 25)

Checking if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 0, infy(y) = 3. So, infy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- supy(y) = 7, supy(z) = 10. So, supy(y) <= supy(z). ✓
Yes, y is E of z.

Checking if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 7, infy(x) = 20. So, supy(y) <= infy(x). ✓
- infx(y) = 4, infx(x) = 5. So, infx(y) <= infx(x). ✓
- supx(x) = 6, supx(y) = 6. So, supx(x) <= supx(y). ✓
Yes, x is N of y.

Checking if x is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 5. So, supx(z) <= infx(x). ✓
- supy(x) = 25, infy(z) = 0. So, supy(x) <= infy(z). ⨯

This doesn't satisfy the SE relation either. I'm now more convinced that the SE relation is inconsistent with the given constraints.

I've tried multiple examples and approaches, and I'm now of the belief that the possible relations between x and z are only NE and E.

Actually, hold up. Let me try this:

- z: (0, 20) to (2, 30)
- y: (4, 10) to (6, 15)
- x: (5, 3) to (6, 5)

Checking if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 20, infy(y) = 10. So, infy(z) <= infy(y). ⨯

Ok this is challenging. Let me think about the issue: For y to be E of z, y's vertical extent should be within z's, which means infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). But if z is too high, we won't be able to have infy(z) <= infy(y). So, for the SE relation, z can't be too high.

Also, for x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x needs to be below z. But if x is N of y, then x is above y. So, y needs to be below both x and z, but y also needs to be to the right of z.

I understand the challenge now. The conditions are in tension but not necessarily contradictory.

Let me attempt a completely different approach:

- z: (0, 10) to (2, 15)
- y: (5, 0) to (7, 5)
- x: (6, 6) to (7, 9)

Checking if y is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 5. So, supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- infy(z) = 10, infy(y) = 0. So, infy(z) <= infy(y). ⨯

It seems that to get an example where x is SE of z, I'm running into constraints that don't allow y to be E of z.

I'm increasingly convinced that the SE relation is inconsistent with the given constraints. Instead of coming up with more examples, let me check the algebraic constraints more thoroughly:

For x to be N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (y is below x).

For y to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's lowest point is below or equal to y's lowest point).
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's highest point is below or equal to z's highest point).

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z).
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z).

It seems contradictory. If x is N of y, then x is above y. If y is E of z, then y is within the vertical extent of z. Given these, how can x be below z (for the SE relation)?

It doesnt appear to be possible for x to be SE of z, given the constraints.

After extensive analysis, I'm convinced that the possible relations between x and z are NE and E (but not SE).

Let me double-check my assertion once more.

From y being E of z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). The first part is what makes the SE relation challenging, because if x is N of y, then supy(y) <= infy(x). Given these, I'd have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which is the same as infy(z) <= infy(x).

But for the SE relation, I'd also need supy(x) <= infy(z), which would give me supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction because infy(x) <= supy(x) must be true for any region.

Therefore, the SE relation is inconsistent with the given constraints, and the possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

So my final answer is NE, E.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, I'll analyze the constraints and determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- Region y is E of region z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supx(z)
