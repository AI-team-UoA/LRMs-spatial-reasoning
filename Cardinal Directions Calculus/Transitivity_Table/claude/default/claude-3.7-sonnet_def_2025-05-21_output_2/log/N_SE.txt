PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the information step by step:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

We want to find all possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of cardinal direction relations:

1. North (N): If a N b, then supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), and supx(a) <= supx(b)
2. Southeast (SE): If a SE b, then supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So, for x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

And for y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's try to infer the relation between x and z based on these constraints.

From x N y and y SE z, we get:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

This means:
- infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(z)
But we can't directly infer the relation between infy(x) and infy(z).

Also:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)

This means:
- infx(x) >= infx(y) >= supx(z)
Which implies:
- infx(x) >= supx(z)

Let's think about the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z:

1. N (North): For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is likely satisfied)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (Not guaranteed, we only know infx(x) >= supx(z))
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (Not guaranteed)

2. NE (Northeast): For x NE z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is likely satisfied)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is satisfied)

3. E (East): For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is satisfied)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (which is likely satisfied)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (Not guaranteed)

4. SE (Southeast): For x SE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is satisfied)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (contradicts the derived infy(x) >= infy(z))

5. S (South): For x S z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (contradicts the derived infy(x) >= infy(z))
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (Not guaranteed)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (Not guaranteed)

6. SW (Southwest): For x SW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (contradicts the derived infx(x) >= supx(z))
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (contradicts the derived infy(x) >= infy(z))

7. W (West): For x W z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (contradicts the derived infx(x) >= supx(z))
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (which is likely satisfied)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (Not guaranteed)

8. NW (Northwest): For x NW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (contradicts the derived infx(x) >= supx(z))
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is likely satisfied)

9. B (Bounding Box): For x B z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (Not guaranteed)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (Not guaranteed)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (which is likely satisfied)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (Not guaranteed)

Hmm, I'm finding it challenging to make definitive conclusions based on the given constraints. Let me approach this differently by considering specific examples or by reasoning using a more direct approach.

Actually, let's think more carefully about the constraints.

For x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can deduce:
1. infx(x) >= infx(y) (from x N y)
2. supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
Combining 1 and 2, we get: infx(x) >= supx(z), which means x is to the east of z.

Also:
3. supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
4. supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
From 3 and 4, we can't directly compare infy(x) and infy(z).

Based on the constraints, x can potentially be N, NE, or E of z. Let's check each:

1. N (North): For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

2. NE (Northeast): For x NE z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)

3. E (East): For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

But I'm still uncertain about the constraints related to the supy of x and z, and also the infx of z. Let me reconsider.

Actually, I think we should consider the positions of the regions. For x to be N of y, x is above y (with possibly some x-overlap). For y to be SE of z, y is below and to the right of z. This gives a triangular arrangement.

Let me draw regions x, y, and z:

z is somewhere in the top-left, y is somewhere in the bottom-right of z, and x is somewhere above y.

Given that y is SE of z, y is entirely below and to the right of z. And given that x is N of y, x is entirely above y.

Based on these positions, x could be:
- N of z (if x is directly above z)
- NE of z (if x is to the right and above z)
- E of z (if x is directly to the right of z)
- B of z (if x is inside the bounding box of z)
- It could also be that x has no direct cardinal relation with z (if it's partially N, partially NE, etc.)

Oh, I said x could be B of z, but that's not right. For x B z, x would need to be entirely inside the bounding box of z. But if x is N of y and y is SE of z, x is probably outside the bounding box of z.

I also need to consider the possibility of multi-tile directions (like N:NE or NE:E), but the question asks for possible relations between x and z, so I'm assuming it's asking for a single-tile relation.

The most likely single-tile relations are N, NE, and E, but I want to ensure I'm not missing any.

Let's think of a counterexample to rule out any directions.

First, I'm pretty sure that x cannot be S, SW, or W of z because:
- If y is SE of z, y is to the right and below z.
- If x is N of y, x is above y.
- This means x is above and to the right of z, making S, SW, and W implausible.

For the directions SE, I need to check. If y is far to the right of z (i.e., very little vertical overlap), and x is barely above y (i.e., very little vertical separation), x might be SE of z. But I'm not sure if this setup is feasible with the given constraints.

Actually, let's check this more carefully:

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
So, we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies the first condition for x SE z.

For the second condition:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
But we can't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z) from these constraints.

Let's reconsider. From the conditions:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

This means:
- x is above y
- y is below and to the right of z

So, the most likely positions for x, y, and z are:
- z in the top-left
- y in the bottom-right
- x above y

In this configuration, it's possible for x to be N, NE, or E of z. It might also be possible for x to be SE, B, or NW of z in some specific arrangements, but I need to verify.

Actual, the more I think about it, I don't think x can be NW of z given the constraints. If y is SE of z, then the most plausible configuration is for z to be in the top-left, with y below and to the right of it. For x to be NW of z, x would have to be the west of z, which seems counterintuitive if x is north of y and y is to the right of z.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
So, we have supy(z) ? infy(x). The relationship isn't clear.

Also, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
So, we have supx(z) <= infx(x). But we need supx(x) <= infx(z) for x NW z, which seems to contradict. So, x probably can't be NW of z.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
So, we have supx(z) <= infx(x). This seems to contradict the requirement for x B z, which is supx(x) <= supx(z).

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
So, we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies the first condition for x SE z.

For the second condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). We know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
But we can't directly infer the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

It seems like x can potentially be SE of z in some configurations, but it's not always guaranteed.

Let us look at what we know carefully and step-by-step.

1. Region x is N of region y
   This means x is above y with potentially some x-overlap.
   Specifically, supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).

2. Region y is SE of region z
   This means y is to the right and below z.
   Specifically, supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
   So, it's not clear if supy(z) <= infy(x).

For x NE z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)

We know:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
   So, supx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies one condition for x NE z.
   
   But as with N, it's not clear if supy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.

For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

We already established supx(z) <= infx(x). Let's check the other conditions:
   - for infy(z) <= infy(x), we have some y constraints in that infy(z) >= supy(y) and infy(x) >= supy(y), but it doesn't directly tell us which one is greater.
   - for supy(x) <= supy(z), again, we don't directly have constraints to check this.

Actually, let's visualize this a bit more. Let's say z is in a position, y is to the southeast of it, and x is to the north of y.

Now, if y is very far to the southeast of z (i.e., very little overlap in both the x and y axes), and x is very far to the north of y (i.e., very little overlap in the x axis), then x could be anywhere from NW to NE of z, including N.

On the other hand, if y has significant overlap with z in the x axis, and x has significant overlap with y in the x axis, then x could be N or NE of z.

And if y is very far to the right of z, and x is not too far north of y, x might be E of z.

So, based on this, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are: NW, N, NE, and E.

But wait, I have to be careful with NW. For x NW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), which seems implausible from our constraints. We know supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), which gives supx(z) <= infx(x). This doesn't directly contradict the requirement for NW, but it makes it implausible.

Upon deeper thought, NW is possible, but with a very specific configuration:
- z has a very wide expanse in the x direction.
- y is at the very right edge of z (satisfying supx(z) <= infx(y)).
- x is to the left of y (while still being N of y).

But, in such a configuration, we'd need to ensure that supx(x) <= infx(z), which is a constraint for x NW z.

Given the constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)

These don't directly imply supx(x) <= infx(z). In fact, the constraints seem to suggest that supx(x) might be greater than infx(z), especially if supx(y) is much greater than infx(y).

I feel like I'm overthinking this. Let's go back to the basics.

If y is SE of z, z is to the left and above y.
If x is N of y, x is above y.

Given these positions, x can be:
- NW of z (if x is to the left of z and highly above).
- N of z (if x is directly above z).
- NE of z (if x is to the right of z and above).
- E of z (if x is directly to the right of z).

I don't think x can be W, SW, S, SE, or B of z given the constraints, especially considering the spatial layout.

So, my conclusion is that x can be NW, N, NE, or E of z.

Let me double-check each of these:

For x NW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Given the constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
It's not clear if supy(z) <= infy(x).

And for supx(x) <= infx(z), we know:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)
But there isn't a direct constraint relating supx(y) to infx(z).

So NW remains a possibility, but it's a bit suspect.

Upon further reflection, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of a more concrete example to clarify the possibilities.

Imagine z is at position (0,0) to (2,2).
For y to be SE of z, it must be to the right and below z. Say y is at position (3,0) to (5,1).
For x to be N of y, it must be above y. Say x is at position (3,2) to (5,3).

In this arrangement, x is NE of z. But what if x is a bit more to the left, say at position (2,2) to (4,3)? Then it's N of z.

What if x is even more to the left, say at position (1,2) to (3,3)? Then it overlaps with z in the x-direction, but it's still above z. So, x would be N of z.

What if x is entirely to the left of z, say at position (-1,2) to (1,3)? Then it's NW of z.

What if y is much more to the right of z, say at position (5,0) to (7,1), and x is directly above y at position (5,2) to (7,3)? Then x is to the right of z, with no overlap in the y-direction. So, x would be E of z.

So x, based on different configurations, can be NW, N, NE, or E of z.

Actually, I just realized that I missed a possible configuration. What if z has a concave shape, such that a part of x can be directly southeast of z? For instance, imagine z has an L-shape with an indent in the southeast corner, and x is positioned in that indent. Then x would be SE of z.

But I think this goes against the assumption the regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which I think means they have to be connected and have no holes. So, I'll discard this possibility.

Based on the constraints and the visualization, my final answer is that the possible single-tile relations between x and z are: NW, N, NE, and E.

Actually, let me check once more with the definitions:

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Since we know:
1. Region x is N of region y which implies:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)

2. Region y is SE of region z which implies:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z)

For supx(x) <= infx(z): We have supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), but we can't deduce supx(x) <= infx(z) from these.

For supy(z) <= infy(x): We have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), but we can't deduce supy(z) <= infy(x) from these.

So, NW remains a possibility, depending on the exact configuration of the regions.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints, we can only deduce that infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). We can't directly deduce infx(z) <= infx(x) or supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, N is a possibility, depending on the exact configuration of the regions.

For x NE z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

We know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
So, we can deduce supx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies one condition for x NE z.

For supy(z) <= infy(x): As before, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), but we can't directly deduce supy(z) <= infy(x) from these.

So, NE is a possibility, and it seems more likely than NW given our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x).

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We already established supx(z) <= infx(x). For the other conditions, we don't have direct constraints from our given information.

So, E is a possibility, depending on the exact configuration of the regions.

In summary, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are: NW, N, NE, and E.

Let me consider multidirectional ones as well:

NW:N (x is both Northwest and North of z): This would imply that x is to the North of z and partially to the Northwest. For this to be the case, z's bounding box would have to be quite wide, and x would overlap with it.

N:NE (x is both North and Northeast of z): Similar to the above, x would be to the North of z and partially to the Northeast.

NW:N:NE (x is Northwest, North, and Northeast of z): This would imply that x is to the North of z and spreads both to the left and the right.

NE:E (x is both Northeast and East of z): This would occur if x is to the East of z and partially to the Northeast.

NW:N:NE:E (x is Northwest, North, Northeast, and East of z): This seems unlikely, as it would imply x is very spread out relative to z.

In other cases, like N:E or NW:E, the regions wouldn't be connected, which violates the assumption.

Given the multidirectional possibilities and the constraints, I believe the valid single-tile relations between x and z are: NW, N, NE, and E. The valid multi-tile relations are the connected combinations of these: NW:N, N:NE, NE:E, and NW:N:NE. The relationship NW:N:NE:E seems implausible, and the same for NW:E.

Actually, let's rethink our approach. We know:
1. Region x is N of region y.
2. Region y is SE of region z.

From these, what can we definitively say about the relation between x and z?

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, what can we deduce?

From infx(y) <= infx(x) (x N y) and supx(z) <= infx(y) (y SE z), we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

This tells us that x is definitely to the right of z. This means x can't be purely W, SW, or NW of z.

From supy(y) <= infy(x) (x N y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (y SE z), we can deduce:
- min(infy(x), infy(z)) >= supy(y)

But this doesn't tell us which one of infy(x) or infy(z) is greater.

Since x is N of y, and y is to the south (and east) of z, it's plausible that x is also to the north of z. However, without more constraints on the vertical bounds, I can't definitively say this.

I think the most I can definitively say is that x is to the right of z (based on the x-coordinates). The exact cardinal direction would depend on the y-coordinates and more specifics about the shapes of x and z.

So, based on the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), and leaving room for different arrangements in the y-axis, the possible relations between x and z are: NE and E. N and NW would be possible only if x has no overlap with z in the x-axis, which means x would have to be further to the right of z.

Wait, I think I'm making a logical error. Let me reconsider:

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From supx(z) <= infx(y) (y SE z) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (x N y), we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the right of z, but that doesn't rule out NW or N. It just means that x can't have its entirety to the west of z.

Let me reconsider the possible cardinal directions:

B (Bounding Box): x would have to be inside z's bounding box, which seems unlikely given the constraints.

N (North): For x N z, x would have to be to the north of z, and overlapping in the x-direction. While supx(z) <= infx(x) suggests x is to the right of z, it's possible for parts of x to still be above z. So, N is a possibility.

NE (Northeast): This is consistent with supx(z) <= infx(x) and would also imply that x is above z. So, NE is a possibility.

E (East): This is consistent with supx(z) <= infx(x) and would imply that x and z have vertical overlap. So, E is a possibility.

SE (Southeast): This would imply x is below z, which seems implausible given the constraints (x is N of y and y is SE of z).

S (South): This would imply x is below z, which also seems implausible.

SW (Southwest): This would imply x is below and to the left of z, both of which seem implausible.

W (West): This would imply x is to the left of z, which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).

NW (Northwest): For x NW z, x would have to be to the northwest of z, which means to the north and to the west. But from supx(z) <= infx(x), we know x is to the right of z, not to the left. So, NW is implausible.

In summary, the most plausible single-tile relations between x and z are: N, NE, and E.

It seems, as I continue to reason, I wind up with different answers. Let's just go back to the constraints provided:

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From supx(z) <= infx(y) (y SE z) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (x N y), we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means that x is strictly to the east (right) of z, or, more technically, there's no overlap in the x-axis, with x being to the east of z.

I do have some additional constraints that the regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk {(x, y): x^2 + y^2 <= 1}. Regions in REG are closed, connected and have connected boundaries.

Now, let's go through each possible cardinal direction one by one:

1. N (North): For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We already know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

2. NE (Northeast): For x NE z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)

   We already know supx(z) <= infx(x). For the first condition, we'd need to determine if supy(z) <= infy(x). Given the constraints supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), it's plausible for supy(z) <= infy(x) if supy(z) is close to supy(y).

   So, x can be NE of z if supy(z) <= infy(x).

3. E (East): For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We already know supx(z) <= infx(x). The other two conditions would depend on the exact positions of the regions. x can be E of z if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

4. SE (Southeast): For x SE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   We already know supx(z) <= infx(x). Given the constraint supy(y) <= infy(z), supy(x) <= infy(z) would be plausible if supy(x) is close to supy(y). x can be SE of z if supy(x) <= infy(z) and the region aren't too convoluted.

5. For the other directions (S, SW, W, NW, B), they're either contradicted by the established constraints or implausible given the setup.

In summary, x can be NE, E, or SE of z, depending on the specific positions. Given that x is N of y and y is SE of z, it seems likely that x is somewhere east of z, and depending on the exact height, it can be to the northeast, east, or southeast.

Actually, I think I accidentally overlooked the height of z versus x. Let's go through a few concrete examples again to refine my understanding:

Imagine z is at position (0,3) to (2,5).

For y to be SE of z, it must be to the right and below z. Say y is at position (3,1) to (5,2).

For x to be N of y, it must be above y. Say x is at position (3,3) to (5,4). In this case x is directly to the left of z, and neither above nor below. Thus, the relation is E.

What if z extends a bit lower, say from (0,2) to (2,5)? y still satisfies its constraint by being at (3,1) to (5,2), and x is still at (3,3) to (5,4). Now, x is still to the east of z, but it's also at the same height. So, the relation is still E.

What if z's bottom is even lower, say from (0,1) to (2,5)? Now, x at (3,3) to (5,4) is above a part of z. So, the relation is still E, but depending on the specifics, it could also be NE.

Alternatively, what if z's top is lower, say from (0,2) to (2,3)? Now, x at (3,3) to (5,4) is above z. So, the relation is NE.

And if z is very low, say from (0,0) to (2,1)? Now, x at (3,3) to (5,4) is above z (and y). So, the relation is NE.

In terms of a SE relation, it seems less likely given the constraints. For x to be SE of z, x would have to be below the bottom of z. But given that x is N of y and y is SE of z, it seems more likely that x is at a similar level or above z, not below it. However, if z is very tall, and x isn't much above y, it's possible.

Given all of this, it does seem like E and NE are the most likely directions for x relative to z, but it's possible that SE could include SE as well, depending of the configurations.

Let me see if I can narrow down the possibilities by working more with the constraints.

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From supx(z) <= infx(y) (y SE z) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (x N y), we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the right of z, which supports NE, E, and SE as possibilities.

Let's try to constrain infy(x) relative to infy(z):

We know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
This does not give us a clear relationship between infy(x) and infy(z).

Let's try to constrain supy(x) relative to infy(z):

We know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
Still not a clear relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

It seems the constraints we have don't directly restrict the y-coordinates of x relative to z in a way that would rule out NE, E, or SE.

Let's revisit the constraints and think of concrete examples:

For a region to be SE of another, it must be to the right and below. For a region to be N of another, it must be above. Given that x is N of y and y is SE of z, the most intuitive arrangement is z in the top-left, y in the bottom-right, and x above y.

Hmm, I find that working with visualizations will be helpful. Let's try a simple one.

Imagine a plane with (0,0) at the bottom left. Now:
- Place z at (0,5) to (2,7): infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 5, supy(z) = 7.
- Place y at (3,2) to (5,4): infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 5, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4.
- Place x at (4,5) to (5,7): infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 7.

With these positions, y is SE of z, and x is N of y. What's the relation between x and z?

Let's check:
- infx(z) = 0 and supx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 4 and supx(x) = 5. So, x is to the right of z.
- infy(z) = 5 and supy(z) = 7, infy(x) = 5 and supy(x) = 7. So, x is at the same height as z.

The relation is E.

Let's try another setup:
- Place z at (0,5) to (2,7): infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 5, supy(z) = 7.
- Place y at (3,2) to (5,4): infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 5, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4.
- Place x at (4,8) to (5,9): infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 8, supy(x) = 9.

With these positions, y is SE of z, and x is N of y. What's the relation between x and z?

Let's check:
- infx(z) = 0 and supx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 4 and supx(x) = 5. So, x is to the right of z.
- infy(z) = 5 and supy(z) = 7, infy(x) = 8 and supy(x) = 9. So, x is above z.

The relation is NE.

Let's try another setup:
- Place z at (0,8) to (2,10): infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 8, supy(z) = 10.
- Place y at (3,2) to (5,4): infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 5, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4.
- Place x at (4,5) to (5,7): infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 7.

With these positions, y is SE of z, and x is N of y. What's the relation between x and z?

Let's check:
- infx(z) = 0 and supx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 4 and supx(x) = 5. So, x is to the right of z.
- infy(z) = 8 and supy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 5 and supy(x) = 7. So, x is below z.

The relation is SE.

All of these checks are correct!

So, based on the constraints and these concrete examples, x can be NE, E, or SE of z.

This one was a bit tricky, but I think I arrived at the right conclusion. Based on the constraints and examples, x can be NE, E, or SE of z.

Just as a final check: Are there any other possible relations between x and z that I've missed?

Let's try to visualize it one more time. If y is to the southeast of z, and x is to the north of y, where can x be relative to z?

If y is to the southeast of z, it's below and to the right of z. If x is to the north of y, it's above y. Depending on how far y is from z, and how far x is from y, x can be:
- NE of z (above to the right)
- E of z (directly to the right)
- SE of z (below to the right)

I don't think x can be N, NW, W, SW, S, or B of z given the constraints.

So, my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Actually, let's double-check one more time. I've been a bit imprecise with my work and need to ensure I'm doing this correctly.

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) 
- supx(x) <= supx(y) 

For y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) 
- supy(y) <= infy(z) 

From the first set, we know that x is north of y, so x is above y with potentially some x-overlap.
From the second set, we know that y is southeast of z, so y is to the right and below z.

From supx(z) <= infx(y) (y SE z) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (x N y), we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) 

This means x is to the right of z (no x-overlap).

From supy(y) <= infy(x) (x N y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (y SE z), we can deduce that:
- min(infy(x), infy(z)) >= supy(y)
But it's not clear which of infy(x) or infy(z) is greater.

Let's check each possible relation:

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) 
- infx(z) <= infx(x) 
- supx(x) <= supx(z) 

From supx(z) <= infx(x), it's clear that supx(x) cannot be <= supx(z), because that would imply x is within the x-range of z. So, x is not N of z.

For x NE z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) 
- supx(z) <= infx(x) 

We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x). However, it's not clear from our given constraints if supy(z) <= infy(x). But we can devise a specific arrangement where this is true, as we did in the examples. So, NE is possible.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) 
- infy(z) <= infy(x) 
- supy(x) <= supy(z) 

We've established supx(z) <= infx(x). The other two conditions would need to be checked based on specific configurations, but it's definitely possible. So, E is possible.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) 
- supy(x) <= infy(z) 

We've established supx(z) <= infx(x). For the second condition, again, it depends on the specific arrangement, but it's definitely possible. So, SE is possible.

For the other cardinal directions, they're either contradicted by the constraints or implausible given the setup.

In summary, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE.

Actually I think I'm making a mistake. Let's think very specifically:

If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

So, let's be precise with the given constraints:

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's see what constraints you can impose on the relationship between x and z:

From x N y, we have infx(y) <= infx(x), and from y SE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y). This gives us:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), which is the x-coordinate constraint for E, NE, or SE.

Now let's check the y-coordinate constraints.

From x N y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x), and from y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z). This gives us:
- supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z))
But this doesn't give us a direct relation between infy(x) and infy(z).

Let's check the required constraints for the possible directions:

For x NE z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
For x E z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
For x SE z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).

From the constraints we have, we can't directly give any further information on the y-coordinate by just manipulating the given constraints.

Without being able to determine the y-coordinates, I can't exclude any of those directions. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NE of z. If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), x is E of z. If supy(x) <= infy(z), x is SE of z.

I think this means that all three directions (NE, E, and SE) are possible.

Now I'm going to check by doing examples.

Example 1:
Imagine z at (0, 5) to (2, 7) [infx(z)=0, supx(z)=2, infy(z)=5, supy(z)=7]
y at (3, 2) to (5, 4) [infx(y)=3, supx(y)=5, infy(y)=2, supy(y)=4]
x at (3, 8) to (5, 10) [infx(x)=3, supx(x)=5, infy(x)=8, supy(x)=10]

Here, y is SE of z and x is N of y. The relation between x and z is NE (since infx(x) > supx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z)).

Example 2:
Imagine z at (0, 5) to (2, 10) [infx(z)=0, supx(z)=2, infy(z)=5, supy(z)=10]
y at (3, 2) to (5, 4) [infx(y)=3, supx(y)=5, infy(y)=2, supy(y)=4]
x at (3, 6) to (5, 9) [infx(x)=3, supx(x)=5, infy(x)=6, supy(x)=9]

Here, y is SE of z and x is N of y. The relation between x and z is E (since infx(x) > supx(z), and x and z overlap in the y-axis).

Example 3:
Imagine z at (0, 8) to (2, 12) [infx(z)=0, supx(z)=2, infy(z)=8, supy(z)=12]
y at (3, 2) to (5, 4) [infx(y)=3, supx(y)=5, infy(y)=2, supy(y)=4]
x at (3, 5) to (5, 7) [infx(x)=3, supx(x)=5, infy(x)=5, supy(x)=7]

Here, y is SE of z and x is N of y. The relation between x and z is SE (since infx(x) > supx(z) and supy(x) < infy(z)).

Each of these examples shows one of the three possible relations: NE, E, and SE. So, I'm confident that all three are valid possibilities.

In summary, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Hmm,    I'm starting to reconsider the possibility of a "NW" orientation while examining our constraints. 

For x NW z, 
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  (1)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (2)

So i think NW is not possible. For x NW z, (1) would require that x is to the left of z. But we've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z, not to the left. This contradicts the requirement for x NW z. Because of the constraint that infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), it means that x is positioned to the right of both y and z, which contradicts the requirement for a "NW" relation.

Let me think about B as well. For x B z, infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z). But we've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) <= supx(z). So B isn't possible either.

Ah, so the possible relation between x and z, based on the given constraints, is (N, NE, or E).

I'mg going to check:

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

Wait. I've previously derived that supx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts the supx(x) <= supx(z) that we need for N. So actually, N is not possible.

For x NE z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

And the second part is sure, and the first part might be true. What's if we have an example where this is met? Might just take some effort to construct.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

And again, the first part is sure, but the latter two might be met. I can construct an example.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

And we know the first part is sure, just need to construct an example where the second part is also met.

Let's just try one last time:
z at (0,6) to (2,10) [infx(z)=0, supx(z)=2, infy(z)=6, supy(z)=10]
y at (3,3) to (5,5) [infx(y)=3, supx(y)=5, infy(y)=3, supy(y)=5]
x at (4,10) to (6,12) [infx(x)=4, supx(x)=6, infy(x)=10, supy(x)=12]

Here, y is SE of z since supx(z)=2 <= infx(y)=3 and supy(y)=5 <= infy(z)=6.
And x is N of y since supy(y)=5 <= infy(x)=10, infx(y)=3 <= infx(x)=4, and supx(x)=6 <= supx(y)=5 - no wait, this constraint is infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). We'd need supx(x)=6 <= supx(y)=5, which isn't true. Ah, I think this is the constraint I kept on forgetting in earlier parts of the problem

So, for x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

And for y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let me just see what I can directly infer from this.

From supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), I get supx(z) <= infx(x). And from supx(x) <= supx(y), I also derive supx(x) <= supx(y). So this only gives me supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), which doesn't tell me the complete relation between x and z in the x-axis.

Similarly, from supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), I can deduce that supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z)). But, again, I can't directly deduce the relation between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and any other y-coordinate. I just don't have enough constraints to pinpoint a specific relation between x and z. I can only say that certain relations are impossible given the constraints, and then certain relations are possible if the regions are arranged in certain ways.

But since supx(z) <= infx(x) (derived from supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x)), we know that z is strictly to the left of x in the x-axis. This means the possible relations are N, NE, E, SE, S.

Now, let's examine the constraints for each of these:

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know supx(z) <= infx(x) from our derivation, which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

For x NE z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

We've derived supx(z) <= infx(x), so that part is satisfied. For supy(z) <= infy(x), it's not directly deducible from our constraints, but it's possible.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've derived supx(z) <= infx(x), so that part is satisfied. The other two are not directly deducible, but they're possible.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've derived supx(z) <= infx(x), so that part is satisfied. For supy(x) <= infy(z), it's not directly deducible, but it's possible.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know supx(z) <= infx(x) from our derivation, which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

Given all of the above, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Given I couldn't pinpoint a unique relation from the constraints, I think the valid answer is that the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

So the answer is: NE, E, SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions provided, I'll determine which cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

For x N y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)

This means x is strictly to the right of z (no x-axis overlap), which immediately rules out W, SW, NW, B, N, and S relations.

Let me check the remaining possibilities:

1. NE: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - First condition is satisfied
   - Second condition is possible in certain configurations

2. E: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - First condition is satisfied
   - Other conditions are possible in certain configurations

3. SE: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - First condition is satisfied
   - Second condition is possible in certain configurations

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, SE
