PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully work through this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

First, let me recall the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- x W y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, from "x W y", we know:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
2. infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's southern bound is not higher than x's southern bound)
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's northern bound is not higher than y's northern bound)

From "y NW z", we know:
4. supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
5. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

Now, I need to determine what these constraints tell us about the relation between x and z.

From 1 and 4, using transitivity:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.

Now let's consider the north-south positioning:

From 5, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
From 2, we know infy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Using transitivity:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

Given that x is both to the west of z and to the north of z, x must be NW of z.

Wait, I need to double-check this. The definition of x NW z is:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

We've shown that both of these conditions are satisfied. So, x is indeed NW of z.

Actually, let's think about this more carefully. I was rushing to a conclusion.

From "x W y", we know:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
2. infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the southern bound of y is less than or equal to the southern bound of x)
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (the northern bound of x is less than or equal to the northern bound of y)

From "y NW z", we know:
4. supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
5. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

Now, for the relation between x and z:

For the west-east positioning, from 1 and 4:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is to the west of z.

For the north-south positioning, we have several constraints:
From 2: infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
From 3: supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
From 5: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Using 2 and 5: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

Given that x is both to the west of z and to the north of z, x could be NW of z.

But, there's one more thing I need to check. The definition of NW requires:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've also shown)

So, x NW z is a valid relation.

However, I want to see if there are other possibilities as well.

Given the constraints we have, x must be to the west of z. But the exact north-south positioning might have some flexibility. Let's examine all possible cardinal direction relations:

- N: This would mean infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the requirement that infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be to the N of z.

- NE: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts our finding that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x cannot be to the NE of z.

- E: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which again contradicts our finding. So, x cannot be to the E of z.

- SE: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Both of these conditions contradict our findings. So, x cannot be to the SE of z.

- S: This would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts our finding that supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be to the S of z.

- SW: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first condition is satisfied, but the second contradicts our finding. So, x cannot be to the SW of z.

- W: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've shown the first condition is met. We also know that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is entirely south of x, which is stronger than the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x). However, the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) might not be satisfied based on our given constraints. So, x may not necessarily be W of z.

- B: This would mean infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given that we've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z), this contradicts the requirement that infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

To make sure, I wanted to consider the NW relation between x and z more formally:

NW means: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

We've shown both of these conditions are met based on the given constraints. So, x NW z is a valid relation.

Actually, let me reexamine the case for the W relation. For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's southern bound is less than or equal to x's southern bound)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's northern bound is less than or equal to z's northern bound)

From the constraints, we know that supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This indicates that z is entirely south of x. If z is entirely south of x, then it's not possible for infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (the southern bound of z is less than or equal to the southern bound of x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (the northern bound of x is less than or equal to the northern bound of z) to both be true simultaneously. 

The W relation requires x and z to overlap in the north-south dimension. But if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), they don't overlap in this dimension. So, x W z is not a valid relation.

But wait, I've been working with the wrong definition of "W". Let me go back to the provided definitions:

a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

So, for x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's southern bound is less than or equal to x's southern bound)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's northern bound is less than or equal to z's northern bound)

But, as we've discussed, the constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which means z is entirely south of x) makes it impossible for infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) to both be true simultaneously. So, x W z is not a valid relation.

Similarly, for the NW relation, the definition is:
a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've also shown)

So, based on the given constraints, x NW z is a valid relation.

But I realized that we need to be more comprehensive in our exploration of the spatial constraints. Let's examine it again. From the given relation "x W y", we know:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
2. infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's southern bound is not higher than x's southern bound)
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's northern bound is not higher than y's northern bound)

From the relation "y NW z", we know:
4. supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
5. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

These rules by themselves don't provide direct constraints on the relationship between x and z. I need to reason through the implications.

For the west-east positioning:
From 1 and 4, using transitivity, we get:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.

For the north-south positioning, we have the following:

From 2 and 5:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means z is entirely south of x.

Based on these, the relation must be either W, NW, or SW:

For W, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's southern bound is less than or equal to x's southern bound)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's northern bound is less than or equal to z's northern bound)

However, as we've discussed, the constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which means z is entirely south of x) makes it impossible for supy(x) ≤ supy(z) to be true. So, x W z is not a valid relation.

For NW, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've also shown)

So, x NW z is a valid relation.

For SW, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x's northern bound is less than or equal to z's southern bound)

However, from the constraints, we don't have direct information about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

From 3 and 5, we have:
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These don't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z). So, the relation x SW z might be possible.

But given the constraints, we know:
- x is to the west of y
- y is to the northwest of z
- z is to the south of y

If y is to the northwest of z, then z is to the southeast of y. This means that z is to the east and south of y. If z is to the south of y, and x's north-south position overlaps with y (since x W y), then z should generally be to the south of x as well.

But let's be more careful. Given "x W y", we have:
infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's southern bound is not higher than x's southern bound)
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's northern bound is not higher than y's northern bound)

Given "y NW z", we have:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

Crucially, we don't have direct information about the relationship between infy(z) and infy(y). So, we can't conclude that z is entirely south of y. It could be that z's north-south position partially overlaps with y's, just that z's northern bound is below y's southern bound.

Hmm, I made a mistake. Let me reread the definition of y NW z:
"a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)"

So, "y NW z" means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

So, z is indeed entirely south of y, which is what I had initially concluded.

Now, given "x W y", we have:
infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's southern bound is not higher than x's southern bound)

Combining with "supy(z) ≤ infy(y)", we get:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means z is entirely south of x.

For the SW relation, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x's northern bound is less than or equal to z's southern bound)

However, we've established that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is entirely south of x. This contradicts the requirement for SW that x is entirely south of z. So, x SW z is not a valid relation.

Given the constraints, the only valid relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, one more check. We've established:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is entirely south of x)

Hmm, I was thinking that this fully constrains the relation to be NW, but now I'm considering if other possibilities are consistent with these constraints.

For W:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's southern bound is less than or equal to x's southern bound - uncertain)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's northern bound is less than or equal to z's northern bound - uncertain)

Given that we know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), it's not possible for supy(x) ≤ supy(z) to be true. So, x W z is not a valid relation.

For NW:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied)

x NW z is a valid relation.

Given what we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Let's check all possible cardinal directions again to be thorough:

- B: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  - So, B is not possible.

- S: supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) doesn't contradict supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x), but it's a stronger constraint.
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
  - So, S is not possible.

- SW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - We have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied).
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
  - So, SW is not possible.

- W: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied).
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  - So, W is not possible.

- NW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied).
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied).
  - So, NW is possible.

- N: supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  - So, N is not possible.

- NE: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  - So, NE is not possible.

- E: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  - So, E is not possible.

- SE: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  - So, SE is not possible.

Based on the constraints, the only valid relation between x and z is NW.

Wait, let me double-check the definition of "x W y" and "y NW z" again:

"a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)"

So:
"x W y" means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

"a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)"

So:
"y NW z" means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Now, from "x W y" and "y NW z", I'll derive constraints on the relation between x and z.

From "x W y", we know:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
2. infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From "y NW z", we know:
4. supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
5. supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

For the west-east positioning between x and z:
From 1 and 4, using transitivity:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.

For the north-south positioning between x and z:
From 2 and 5, using transitivity:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means z's northern bound is below x's southern bound. I.e., z is entirely south of x.

Now, based on these constraints, let's check various cardinal direction relations between x and z:

For x NW z:
I need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've also established)

So, x NW z is a valid relation based on the given constraints.

Let's check a few more to be sure:

For x W z:
I need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (this is about z's southern bound vs. x's southern bound)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (this is about x's northern bound vs. z's northern bound)

Given that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), z is entirely south of x. This means infy(z) < supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is met.

However, if z is entirely south of x, then supy(z) < infy(x) ≤ supy(x) (since it's a region, its southern bound is less than its northern bound). This contradicts the requirement that supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x W z is not a valid relation.

For x SW z:
I need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (this is about x's northern bound vs. z's southern bound)

Given that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), z is entirely south of x. If x and z are two separate regions, then infy(x) < supy(x). So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(x). We need to determine if supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But from our constraints, we don't have direct information about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

In fact, it could be that infy(z) < supy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(x), which would mean x can't be SW of z. But it could also be that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would allow x SW z to be a valid relation.

So, based on the given constraints, x SW z could potentially be a valid relation, but it's not guaranteed. The relation x NW z is the one that's definitely valid.

But there's a contradiction somewhere. If x is NW of z, it can't also be SW of z, since these are mutually exclusive relations.

Let me be more careful. The NW relation states:
"a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)"

So, x NW z means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've also established)

This means x is to the west of z, and z is to the south of x.

For the SW relation:
"a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)"

So, x SW z means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which means x is to the south of z)

But we've already established that z is to the south of x (i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). These two statements, "z is to the south of x" and "x is to the south of z," can't both be true. So, x SW z is not a valid relation.

Let's check the W relation one more time:
"a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)"

So, x W z means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's southern bound is not higher than x's southern bound)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's northern bound is not higher than z's northern bound)

We haven't directly established the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), or between supy(x) and supy(z). Let's check if our existing constraints can help.

From "x W y" and "y NW z", we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (z is to the south of x)

The second point means that z's northern bound is below x's southern bound. This implies that z's entire north-south extent is below x's southern bound. In this case, it's not possible for infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) to both be true simultaneously, which are conditions required for the W relation. So, x W z is not a valid relation.

Let's try to visualize this to make it clearer. Given the constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is to the south of x)

In a 2D plane, this means:
- The rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z.
- The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x.

Visually:
```
    x
        z
```

Here, x is to the northwest of z, which aligns with the NW relation. It's not possible for x to be to the west, south, southwest, or any other direction relative to z given these constraints.

Going through all cardinal directions one more time:

1. B (Inside bounding box): This would mean infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But we've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x B z is not possible.

2. S (South): This would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But we've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x S z is not possible.

3. SW (Southwest): This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we've also established supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (since x and z are regions, infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z)). So, x SW z is not possible.

4. W (West): This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we've also established supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (since infy(x) < supy(x) for a region). So, x W z is not possible.

5. NW (Northwest): This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We've established both of these conditions. So, x NW z is possible.

6. N (North): This would mean supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we've also established supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x N z is not possible.

7. NE (Northeast): This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we've also established supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

8. E (East): This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've established infy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we've also established supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x E z is not possible.

9. SE (Southeast): This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But we've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x SE z is not possible.

Good, so we have thoroughly verified that the only possible relation between x and z is NW. 

Actually, I want to double-check that x SW z is not a valid relation. From our constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is to the south of x)

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is true)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (meaning x's northern bound is below z's southern bound)

From the constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we get that z's northern bound is below x's southern bound. For regions in the plane, the northern bound is greater than the southern bound. So, infy(z) < supy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) ≤ infy(z) for the SW relation. So, x SW z is not a valid relation.

Let's revisit our constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is to the south of x)

Actually, wait. Now I noticed something: I assumed that supy(z) ≤ infy(x) means "z is to the south of x". But it actually means the top of z is below the bottom of x. That is, z and x don't overlap vertically, and z is lower than x. Which is exactly what I visualized earlier.

For a region, its northern bound is greater than its southern bound, i.e., infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a. Given supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we have: infy(z) < supy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(x). This means z's entire north-south extent is below x's, which is a stronger condition than simply saying "z is to the south of x".

So, our constraints say:
- x is to the west of z (they don't overlap in the east-west direction).
- z is entirely below x (they don't overlap in the north-south direction).

This places z to the southeast of x, or equivalently, x to the northwest of z.

So, based on the given constraints, the only valid relation between x and z is NW.

I think we're having a terminology confusion. I'm saying "z is to the south of x" as shorthand for "z's entire north-south extent is south of x's", which is what the constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) implies. I'm not just saying "z is generally in a southerly direction from x".

OK actually now I want to double-check all the cardinal directions:

For B (Inside bounding box), we need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) can't be true. So B is ruled out.

For S (South), we need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) can't be true. So S is ruled out.

For SW (Southwest), we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Given supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we have infy(z) < supy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So SW is ruled out.

For W (West), we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given supy(z) ≤ infy(x), the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can't be true (since infy(x) < supy(x)). So W is ruled out.

For NW (Northwest), we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Both of these conditions are directly derived from our constraints. So NW is a valid relation.

For N (North), we need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) can't be true. So N is ruled out.

For NE (Northeast), we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) can't be true (since infx(z) ≤ supx(z)). So NE is ruled out.

For E (East), we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) can't be true. So E is ruled out.

For SE (Southeast), we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) can't be true. So SE is ruled out.

So, NW is the only valid relation.

Actually, the constraints we have are derived from "x W y" and "y NW z". Let's double-check our reasoning.

From "x W y", we know:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
2. infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's southern bound is not higher than x's southern bound)
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's northern bound is not higher than y's northern bound)

From "y NW z", we know:
4. supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
5. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

For the west-east positioning between x and z:
From 1 and 4, using transitivity:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the west of z, which we verified.

For the north-south positioning between x and z:
From 5, we have: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
From 2, we have: infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Using transitivity:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means z's northern bound is below x's southern bound, which we also verified.

The only cardinal direction relation that requires both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is NW. So, x NW z is the only valid relation.

Actually let me double-check, the problem constraints. We have two regions, x and y.

- x W y
- y NW z

And we need to find all the possible relations between x and z.

One complication is that when the problem states "x W y", it's saying that the relation between x and y is W, not that y is to the west of x. Specifically, it means x is to the west of y, as defined by:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Let me double check our derived constraints one more time:

From "x W y", we get:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
2. infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From "y NW z", we get:
4. supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
5. supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From 1 and 4, using transitivity:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.

From 5 and 2, using transitivity:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means z's northern bound is below x's southern bound, or equivalently, z is entirely south of x.

Given these two derived constraints, we know x is to the northwest of z. But, crucially, we're looking for the relation x ? z, which means the relation where x is the "a" and z is the "b" in our definitions.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z) - This is satisfied.
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is entirely south of x) - This is also satisfied.

So, x NW z is a valid relation.

And, as we've verified, none of the other cardinal direction relations satisfy these derived constraints. So, x NW z is the only possible relation between x and z.

The fact that I keep getting to the same conclusion makes me confident that x NW z is the only possible relation between x and z.

But, to be extra sure, let's just brute-force check if there are any other possible relations and see if we've missed anything. I'll go through all 9 cardinal directions:

1. B (Inside bounding box):
  - Requirements: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
  - We derived: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
  - So B is not possible.

2. S (South):
  - Requirements: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
  - We derived: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x, which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - So S is not possible.

3. SW (Southwest):
  - Requirements: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - We derived: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is satisfied.
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) implies infy(z) < supy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(x) (since infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a)
  - This contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
  - So SW is not possible.

4. W (West):
  - Requirements: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
  - We derived: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is satisfied.
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) implies z's northernmost point is below x's southernmost point, which contradicts both infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  - So W is not possible.

5. NW (Northwest):
  - Requirements: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - We derived: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - Both requirements are satisfied.
  - So NW is possible.

6. N (North):
  - Requirements: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
  - We derived: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is satisfied.
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) implies infx(z) > supx(x) > infx(x) (since infx(a) < supx(a) for any region a)
  - This contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  - So N is not possible.

7. NE (Northeast):
  - Requirements: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - We derived: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is satisfied.
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) implies supx(z) > infx(z) > supx(x) (since infx(a) < supx(a) for any region a)
  - This contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  - So NE is not possible.

8. E (East):
  - Requirements: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
  - We derived: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) implies supx(z) > infx(z) > supx(x) (since infx(a) < supx(a) for any region a)
  - This contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  - Also, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) implies supy(z) < infy(x) < supy(x) (since infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a)
  - This contradicts supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  - So E is not possible.

9. SE (Southeast):
  - Requirements: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - We derived: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) implies supx(z) > infx(z) > supx(x) (since infx(a) < supx(a) for any region a)
  - This contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  - Also, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) implies infy(z) < supy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(x) (since infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a)
  - This contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
  - So SE is not possible.

After checking all 9 cardinal directions, only NW satisfies our derived constraints. So, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Thus, the answer to the question is that x NW z is the only possible relation between x and z.

ANSWER:

Based on the given relationships, I need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is W of y
- y is NW of z

From "x W y", I know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's southern bound ≤ x's southern bound)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's northern bound ≤ y's northern bound)

From "y NW z", I know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is west of z
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so z is entirely south of x

The only cardinal direction relation that satisfies both "x is west of z" and "z is entirely south of x" is NW.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is:
NW
