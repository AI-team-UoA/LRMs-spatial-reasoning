PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that:
- x is E of y: This means supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). In other words, x is entirely to the east of y, and x is vertically aligned with y (not necessarily fully, but there is some vertical overlap).

- y is E of z: This means supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). In other words, y is entirely to the east of z, and y is vertically aligned with z.

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

First, we can observe that:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (since y is E of z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (since x is E of y)

Combining these, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

Which simplifies to:
supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is entirely to the east of z. But this doesn't fully define the relation. We need to also consider the vertical alignment.

For the vertical alignment:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (since x is E of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (since y is E of z)

Combining these, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). 

Now, I need to determine which cardinal direction(s) this corresponds to.

From supx(z) <= infx(x), we know that x is to the east of z (i.e., x could be in E, NE, or SE relation with z).

From infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), there are a few possibilities:
1. If infy(z) < infy(x) and supy(x) < supy(z), then there's vertical overlap, which, combined with the east relation, means x could be E of z.
2. If infy(z) = infy(x) and supy(x) < supy(z), then x is fully aligned with the bottom of z, which, combined with the east relation, still means x could be E of z.
3. If infy(z) < infy(x) and supy(x) = supy(z), then x is fully aligned with the top of z, which, combined with the east relation, still means x could be E of z.
4. If infy(z) = infy(x) and supy(x) = supy(z), then x and z are vertically aligned, which, combined with the east relation, still means x is E of z.

But I also need to consider other possible relations.

If there's no vertical overlap (i.e., supy(x) < infy(z) or supy(z) < infy(x)), then x could be NE or SE of z.

But from the constraints we derived:
infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We can infer that supy(z) < infy(x) is not possible.

But what about supy(x) < infy(z)? The constraints don't exclude this possibility. If this is the case, then x would be below z but also to the east, which means x would be SE of z.

Similarly, if infy(x) > supy(z), then x would be above z but also to the east, which means x would be NE of z.

However, the contraints seem to imply infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which suggests some vertical overlap or alignment.

But actually, the constraints don't directly relate infy(x) to supy(z) or supy(x) to infy(z). Let me reconsider.

From:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

We can conclude:
infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

But we can't determine the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z) or between supy(x) and infy(z) directly.

Let's consider different scenarios:

1. If infy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x), then there's vertical overlap, which, combined with the east relation, means x is E of z.

2. If infy(x) >= supy(z), then x is entirely above z. Combined with the east relation, this means x is NE of z.

3. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is entirely below z. Combined with the east relation, this means x is SE of z.

Given the constraints:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Scenarios 2 and 3 would require specific conditions:

For scenario 2 (x is NE of z):
infy(x) >= supy(z)
But we know infy(x) >= infy(y) >= infy(z). For x to be NE of z, we would also need infy(x) >= supy(z). This is possible if y and z have a specific vertical relationship.

For scenario 3 (x is SE of z):
supy(x) <= infy(z)
But we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). For x to be SE of z, we would also need supy(x) <= infy(z). Again, this is possible if y and z have a specific vertical relationship.

Let me try to further clarify:

For E relation: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
For NE relation: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
For SE relation: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

Given the constraints:
supx(z) <= infx(x) (derived from transitivity)
infy(z) <= infy(x) (derived from transitivity)
supy(x) <= supy(z) (derived from transitivity)

we can see that these constraints are consistent with the E relation. 

For the NE relation, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), which might or might not be true given our constraints.

For the SE relation, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts our constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) unless infy(z) = infy(x) and supy(x) = infy(z). This is a very specific case and is generally not considered in the usual definition of these relations.

Hmm, I think I'm not approaching this problem quite right. Let me try again more systematically.

Given:
- x is E of y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let me see what this implies for the relationship between x and z:

1. For the x-coordinate:
   supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
   This means supx(z) <= infx(x), so x is to the east of z.

2. For the y-coordinate:
   a. Lower bound: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
   b. Upper bound: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): x is to the east of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): The lower bound of x in the y-coordinate is greater than or equal to the lower bound of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): The upper bound of x in the y-coordinate is less than or equal to the upper bound of z.

Based on the cardinal direction relations, this means:

1. If infy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x), then there's vertical overlap, which, combined with the east relation, means x is E of z.

2. If infy(x) >= supy(z), then x is entirely above z. Combined with the east relation, this means x is NE of z.

3. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is entirely below z. Combined with the east relation, this means x is SE of z.

Given the constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Scenario 3 (x is SE of z) would require supy(x) <= infy(z), which together with infy(z) <= infy(x) would mean supy(x) <= infy(x). This would mean x has zero or negative height, which is not possible for a region in REG (regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk). So, x cannot be SE of z.

Scenario 2 (x is NE of z) would require infy(x) >= supy(z), which together with supy(x) <= supy(z) would mean infy(x) >= supy(x). Again, this would mean x has zero or negative height, which is not possible. So, x cannot be NE of z.

Given that scenarios 2 and 3 are not possible under our constraints, the only possible relation is that x is E of z.

Actually I think I might have made a mistake above. Let me revisit.

Given:
- x is E of y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

We can say:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). So, supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from the given relations)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from the given relations)

But I also need to determine if there's vertical overlap (i.e., if infy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x)).

From the given constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). 

So, at a glance, we don't know if there's vertical overlap. It depends on the specific positions of the regions.

Case 1: There's vertical overlap.
If there's vertical overlap (which is the usual case for E relation), then x is E of z.

Case 2: There's no vertical overlap.
If there's no vertical overlap, there are two sub-cases:
a. x is entirely above z. This means infy(x) >= supy(z). Given that supy(x) <= supy(z) (from our derived constraints), for x to be entirely above z, we would also need infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z). This would mean x is a degenerate region (a point or a horizontal line), which isn't consistent with regions in REG. So, this sub-case is not actually possible.

b. x is entirely below z. This means supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that infy(z) <= infy(x) (from our derived constraints), for x to be entirely below z, we would also need supy(x) = infy(x) = infy(z). Again, this would mean x is a degenerate region, which isn't consistent with regions in REG. So, this sub-case is also not possible.

So, case 2 (no vertical overlap) is not possible under the constraints and the definition of regions in REG.

So, after all this analysis, it seems like the only possible relation is that x is E of z. But I'm not fully convinced by my reasoning. Let me check this again.

Actually, I think I'm overlooking something. I've been trying to be overly precise. Let's take a step back and think about the problem.

Given that x is E of y and y is E of z, the most obvious conclusion is that x is E of z (i.e., x is entirely to the east of z). We can indeed prove this by transitivity of the "to the east of" relation (as we did earlier). But, for the full cardinal direction relation, we also need to consider the vertical alignment.

From the constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

It's true that these suggest x and z might have some vertical alignment. But they don't guarantee it. For example, x could be at a position such that infy(x) > supy(z), in which case x would be NE of z.

Actually, let me think about this in a more visual way. 

E relation requires vertical overlap or alignment, which means infy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x).

Given:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

The first constraint doesn't guarantee infy(z) < supy(x), and the second constraint doesn't guarantee infy(x) < supy(z).

Example case where x is NE of z:
- If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is entirely above z. This, combined with x being to the east of z, means x is NE of z.

Can this case happen? Yes, for instance if y is also NE of z.

Example case where x is SE of z:
- If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is entirely below z. This, combined with x being to the east of z, means x is SE of z.

Can this case happen? Yes, for instance if y is also SE of z.

Given the transitive constraints, x can be E, NE, or SE of z, depending on the specific positions of the regions. Or can it be?

Let me once again be more explicit. I need to check if all these potential relations can be realized without violating the given conditions.

Suppose x is E of y and y is E of z.

For x to be NE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is satisfied by transitivity)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we want to ensure for NE relation)

From the given conditions:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) is not directly implied by the given conditions. However, it's possible that infy(x) is much greater than supy(z), ensuring that x is entirely above z.

So, x can be NE of z if y is positioned such that the vertical overlap of y with z and the vertical overlap of x with y do not result in a vertical overlap of x with z. Physically, this is possible. For instance, if x is only slightly above y and y is at the very top of z, then x can be entirely above z.

Similarly, for x to be SE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is satisfied by transitivity)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we want to ensure for SE relation)

The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is also not directly implied by the given conditions, but it's possible if y is positioned such that the vertical overlaps work out.

In other words, the constraints we derived from transitivity:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

allow for other cardinal directions, like NE and SE, to be possible. 

So I've convinced myself. If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then x can be E, NE, or SE of z, depending on the specific positions of the regions.

Hmm, actually, I'm seeing a flaw in my prior reasoning. Let me clarify one last time.

For the E relation:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For the NE relation:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

For the SE relation:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the given conditions (x is E of y and y is E of z), we derived:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (by transitivity)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (by transitivity)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (by transitivity)

For x to be NE of z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x). This is not directly implied by the derived constraints. However, it's possible that infy(x) is much greater than supy(z), ensuring that x is entirely above z.

For x to be SE of z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z). This conflicts with the derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) because for a valid region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x). So, x cannot be SE of z.

So, ok actually we have to be careful. I think x could only be E or NE of z. 

Actually let's directly try to find a contradiction to determine what's possible. Suppose we have the conditions:
- x is E of y
- y is E of z

And for the sake of contradiction, let's postulate x is SE of z. Given these constraints, we have: 
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (from both E of y, and SE of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (from SE of z)

But we also know from transitvity that: 
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) 

So we have: supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). 

But for a valid region, infy(x) is strictly less than supy(x). So we can't have supy(x) <= infy(x). Thus, we have a contradiction, and x cannot be SE of z.

Hmm, let's check the possibility if x is B of z (i.e., x is inside the bounding box of z).

For the B relation:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the given conditions (x is E of y and y is E of z), we derived:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (by transitivity)

But for x to be B of z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) because for a valid region, infx(x) < supx(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

Actually, I think I still made a small oversight earlier. Let me re-check the possibility of x being SE of z.

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is satisfied by transitivity)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we want to ensure for SE relation)

From the given conditions, we derived:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (by transitivity)

For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But we also have infy(z) <= infy(x), which would mean supy(x) <= infy(x). For a valid region, infy(x) < supy(x). So, this is a contradiction. Hence, x cannot be SE of z.

I think my logic regarding the impossibility of certain relations has been correct, but I didn't express it clearly. Let me re-summarize.

Suppose we have the conditions:
- x is E of y
- y is E of z

What relation can x have with z? 

We know by transitivity that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.

For x to be E of z, we need vertical overlap, i.e., infy(z) < supy(x) and infy(x) < supy(z). From the derived constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). These don't directly guarantee vertical overlap, but it's possible depending on the specific positions.

For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). This isn't directly implied by the derived constraints, but it's possible that infy(x) is much greater than supy(z), ensuring that x is entirely above z. 

For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). This conflicts with the derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) because for a valid region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x). So, x cannot be SE of z.

So, if x is E of y and y is E of z, then x can be E or NE of z, depending on the specific positions of the regions. But I'm not 100% sure, it seems like SE is not possible. Let me just double check this.

Ok E and NE are definitely possibilities I'm sure about. 

I'm re-checking SE by trying to come up with a case that works. Imagine z as a big rectangle, and y as a small rectangle positioned at the top-right corner of z. Now, imagine x as a small rectangle positioned at the top-right corner of y.

In this case, x is E of y, and y is E of z. But x is NE of z, not SE.

Actually let me think about the SE case differently. Imagine now z as a big rectangle, and y positioned at the top portion on its eastern frontier, and x positioned at the lower portion on the eastern frontier of y. In this case, when we try to determine the relationship between x and z, x is in the eastern half of the space. Is it also in the lower half?

Let's be more precise. Suppose x is E of y and y is E of z. This means supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), thus indeed supx(z) <= infx(x), i.e., x is to the east of z.

It also means that if we have the y-coordinates: 
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from x being E of y and y being E of z),
then x doesn't extend above z. 

And it also means that if we have: 
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x being E of y and y being E of z), 
then x starts (in the vertical direction) above (or at the same height as) z.

So in other words, x doesn't extend below z, but it also doesn't start below z. I.e., we have infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z). 

For SE relation we want: supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know: infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). 
So SE relation would require: supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This is a contradiction, so SE is not possible.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful with the definition of E relation.

For 'a E b', the conditions are:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (there is vertical overlap or a is aligned with b)

Actually I think I was correct before:
For "a E b", the conditions are:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (there is vertical overlap or a is aligned with b)

For "a NE b", the conditions are:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the north of b)

For "a SE b", the conditions are:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is to the south of b)


Given the conditions x is E of y and y is E of z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

By transitivity, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the lower bound of x in the y-coordinate is greater than or equal to the lower bound of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the upper bound of x in the y-coordinate is less than or equal to the upper bound of z)

Now, let's check if x can be SE of z. For "a SE b", the conditions are:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is to the south of b)

Given supx(z) <= infx(x) (from our derived constraints), the first condition is satisfied.

For the second condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But from our derived constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

If supy(x) <= infy(z), given infy(z) <= infy(x), we would have supy(x) <= infy(x). But for a valid region, infy(x) < supy(x). So, we have a contradiction.

Hence, x cannot be SE of z.

OK, so I've shown E is possible, NE is possible, and SE is impossible.

Actually, I think we need to double check other possible cases:
- Can x be W of z? (Hint: supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z))
- Can x be SW of z? (Hint: supx(z) <= infx(x), and...)
- Can x be S of z? (Hint: supx(z) <= infx(x), and...)
- Can x be N of z? (Hint: supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z))
- Can x be NW of z? (Hint: supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z))

Let's go through each:

- Can x be W of z? For W relation, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But from the given conditions, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which would mean supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). For a valid region, infx(z) < supx(z). So, we have a contradiction. Hence, x cannot be W of z.

- Can x be SW of z? For SW relation, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've already shown that supx(x) <= infx(z) leads to a contradiction. Hence, x cannot be SW of z.

- Can x be S of z? For S relation, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z). From the given conditions, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). Hence, x cannot be S of z.

- Can x be N of z? For N relation, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x). From the given conditions, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). Hence, x cannot be N of z.

- Can x be NW of z? For NW relation, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've already shown that supx(x) <= infx(z) leads to a contradiction. Hence, x cannot be NW of z.

Actually, let me again look at B:

Can x be B of z? For B relation, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). From the given conditions, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). Hence, x cannot be B of z.

So, after checking all possible cardinal directions, we conclude that if x is E of y and y is E of z, then x can only be E or NE of z.

Actually, let me double check for two more:

Can x be B of y? For B relation, we need infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). From the given condition (x is E of y), we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(y). Hence, x cannot be B of y.

Can y be B of z? Similar to the above, y cannot be B of z.

So, our answer stands. If x is E of y and y is E of z, then x can be E or NE of z, but no other cardinal direction relation is possible.

Actually, I just found a gap in my logic. Let me re-check the possibility of x being SE of z.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied by transitivity)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (needed for SE relation)

From the given conditions, we have:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (by transitivity)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (by transitivity)

For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But we also derived infy(z) <= infy(x). Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), which would mean supy(x) <= infy(x). This contradicts the requirement for a valid region in REG, which states infy(x) < supy(x). So, x cannot be SE of z.

I think my conclusion was correct all along, but I wanted to double check this specific case once again.

Actually I'm still concerned with the E case. Let me test this with a concrete instance. Imagine:
- z: a big rectangle.
- y: a small rectangle immediately to the east of z. Importantly, y is vertically aligned with z, but doesn't cover the full height of z. Say, y is at the middle portion of z's eastern border.
- x: a small rectangle immediately to the east of y. But here the key is where it is in the vertical position relative to y. If it's aligned with y, then that verifies the pattern: x is E of y, y is E of z, and x is E of z.

But what if x is positioned entirely above y? In this case, x would still be E of y, and y would still be E of z, but the relation between x and z would be NE.

Ah I see, if y is positioned at the top of the eastern border of z and x is positioned above y, then we can indeed have x is E of y, y is E of z, and x is NE of z. That seems like a valid instance for the NE relation.

So our final answer is: If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then x can be E or NE of z, but no other cardinal direction relation is possible.

Actually, I still don't feel 100% sure about the SE case. Let me check again.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (Condition for x being to the east of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (Condition for x being to the south of z)

From the given: 
x is E of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
y is E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

I've determined from the given relationships using transitivity that:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

For x to be SE of z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z), but we've determined infy(z) <= infy(x). 

If two constraints supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) are both true, then supy(x) <= infy(x). But for a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x). This is a contradiction.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z cannot be SE.

I'm confident about this. I'll check for E and NE.

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (Condition for x being to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (Condition for vertical overlap)

From the statements: 
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (Already established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (Already established)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (Already established)

Great, this matches. So we can have: x is E of z.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (Condition for x being to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (Condition for x being to the north of z)

From the statements:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (Already established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (Already established)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (Already established)

For the NE relation, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). This isn't directly implied by the derived constraints. But it's possible if supy(z) = infy(x), especially in specific arrangements of the regions. So, x can be NE of z.

I need to further clarify the NE case. While we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), these don't directly contradict supy(z) <= infy(x). 

Consider a concrete example:
- z: a rectangle with coordinates (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- y: a rectangle with coordinates (11, 9) to (12, 10).
- x: a rectangle with coordinates (13, 10) to (14, 11).

In this example:
- y is E of z (since y is to the right of z and overlaps with z in the vertical direction).
- x is E of y (since x is to the right of y and overlaps with y in the vertical direction).
- But x is NE of z (since x is to the right of z and above z).

So, the NE relation is a valid possibility.

So, my final answer is: If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then x can be E or NE of z, depending on the specific positions of the regions. No other cardinal direction relation is possible.

ANSWER:

Based on the properties of cardinal directions, I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

If x is E of y and y is E of z, I can derive the following:

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

By transitivity, I can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (lower bound constraint)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (upper bound constraint)

These constraints allow for two possible relations:

1. E: When x and z have vertical overlap, all constraints are satisfied.

2. NE: When x is entirely above z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), the constraints are still satisfied.

Other relations like SE are impossible because they would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would contradict infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (since for any valid region, infy(x) < supy(x)).

The possible relations between x and z are: E, NE
