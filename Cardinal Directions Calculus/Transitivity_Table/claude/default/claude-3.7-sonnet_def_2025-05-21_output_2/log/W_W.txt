PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the question step by step: 

We are told that:
- x is W of y (x W y)
- y is W of z (y W z)

We need to determine all possible relations between x and z.

From the definition, x W y means supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
Similarly, y W z means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z.

For the x-axis:
- From x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z)
Combining these, we get: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
Simplifying: supx(x) <= infx(z)

This tells us that x is to the west of z in terms of the x-axis.

For the y-axis:
- From x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining for infy:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

Combining for supy:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z in terms of the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (there's a constraint on the lower y-bound)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (there's a constraint on the upper y-bound)

Now, let's determine which cardinal direction relations satisfy these conditions.

We know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which rules out any relation where x is to the east of z (E, NE, SE) or inside z (B). 

Now, for the y-axis constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) doesn't tell us if x is to the north, south, or at the same y-level as z.
- supy(x) <= supy(z) also doesn't give us a clear indication.

Given the constraints, x could be:
- W of z (if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))
- NW of z (if supy(z) <= infy(x))
- SW of z (if supy(x) <= infy(z))

Let's double-check these relation definitions:

1. x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
2. x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
3. x SW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

Hmm, let me re-examine the constraints we derived.

For the y-axis:
- From x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can't directly derive a relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z). I need to be careful here.

Let's check each cardinal direction relation to see if it's possible for x in relation to z, given the constraints we have.

1. x W z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've shown supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - From the given constraints, infy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x). ✓
   - Also, supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z). ✓
   - Therefore, x W z is a possible relation.

2. x NW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've shown supx(x) <= infx(z). ✓
   - We can't derive a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) from the given constraints. But that doesn't mean it's impossible; it just means we can't determine it for sure.
   - Let's try to see if this scenario is possible. If regions x, y, and z are arranged such that y is slightly above x but still to the west of z, and z is significantly higher than both x and y, then x could be NW of z.
   - I think x NW z is possible.

3. x SW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've shown supx(x) <= infx(z). ✓
   - Again, we can't directly derive a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). But similar to the NW case, if x, y, and z are arranged in a specific way (e.g., y is slightly below x but still to the west of z, and z is significantly lower than both x and y), then x could be SW of z.
   - I think x SW z is possible.

Let's pause here and re-evaluate. I'm finding it a bit hard to derive a conclusive answer because while we can say for sure that x is to the west of z on the x-axis, we can't be as conclusive about their relationship on the y-axis.

Let me reconsider the problem definition:

x W y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y on the x-axis)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the lower bound of x is not below the lower bound of y on the y-axis)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the upper bound of x is not above the upper bound of y on the y-axis)

Similarly, y W z means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (the lower bound of y is not below the lower bound of z on the y-axis)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (the upper bound of y is not above the upper bound of z on the y-axis)

From the first bullet points, we know that x is definitely to the west of z on the x-axis. But the y-axis relationship can vary based on the exact positions of the three regions.

Let's analyze all the possible cardinal directions systematically:

1. x W z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've shown supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - For infy(z) <= infy(x), we have infy(z) <= infy(y) from y W z and infy(y) <= infy(x) from x W y. Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x). ✓
   - For supy(x) <= supy(z), we have supy(x) <= supy(y) from x W y and supy(y) <= supy(z) from y W z. Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z). ✓
   - Therefore, x W z is possible.

2. x NW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've shown supx(x) <= infx(z). ✓
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have a direct relationship from the given constraints. But is it possible?
   - Let's consider a scenario: If region z's y-projection is [0, 3], region y's y-projection is [1, 4], and region x's y-projection is [5, 6], then we have:
     - infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
     - infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 4
     - infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6
   - In this case, infy(z) <= infy(y) ✓, supy(y) <= supy(z) ✗, infy(y) <= infy(x) ✓, supy(x) <= supy(y) ✗. Actually, this doesn't satisfy our constraints.
   - Let's try again: If region z's y-projection is [0, 7], region y's y-projection is [1, 5], and region x's y-projection is [2, 4], then we have:
     - infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 7
     - infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 5
     - infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4
   - In this case, infy(z) <= infy(y) ✓, supy(y) <= supy(z) ✓, infy(y) <= infy(x) ✓, supy(x) <= supy(y) ✓. This satisfies our constraints, but still doesn't make supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Actually, I think I have a realization. Given the constraints, supy(z) <= infy(x) can't be satisfied. 
   - If we have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from our derived constraints), then supy(z) is greater than or equal to supy(x). And since infy(x) must be less than or equal to supy(x) (by the nature of a region), we have supy(z) >= supy(x) >= infy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) required for NW.
   - Therefore, x NW z is not possible.

Wait, let me double-check. We want to see if it's possible to have x NW z.
x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We know that supx(x) <= infx(z). I'm trying to see if we can derive or construct a scenario where supy(z) <= infy(x).

Let me think step by step. We know:
- From x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

I've derived in my previous analysis that:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, we have supy(z) >= supy(x). The question is: Can we have supy(z) <= infy(x)? This would imply supy(x) <= infy(x), which is not possible for a valid region (the lower y-bound of a region must be less than or equal to its upper y-bound). Therefore, we can't have supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x can't be NW of z.

Let's continue analyzing the other directions systematically:

3. x SW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've shown supx(x) <= infx(z). ✓
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we can't directly derive this from the given constraints.
   - Let's try to see if this is possible: If region z's y-projection is [5, 7], region y's y-projection is [2, 4], and region x's y-projection is [1, 3], then we have:
     - infy(z) = 5, supy(z) = 7
     - infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4
     - infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 3
   - In this case, infy(z) <= infy(y) ✗, supy(y) <= supy(z) ✓, infy(y) <= infy(x) ✗, supy(x) <= supy(y) ✓. This doesn't satisfy our constraints.
   - Actually, I realized that there's an issue. We can't set up the regions as I described because they don't satisfy the original constraints. Let me re-think.

Hmm, I think I've been making this more complicated than necessary. The constraints we derived from x W y and y W z should lead us to certain possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

I've derived:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (constraints on the lower y-bounds)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (constraints on the upper y-bounds)

Let's go through each cardinal direction relation:

1. x W z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - All three conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints. ✓
   
2. x NW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - From our derived constraints, supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). This means supy(z) >= supy(x). And for a region x, infy(x) <= supy(x) (the lower bound is not above the upper bound). So, supy(z) >= supy(x) >= infy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) required for NW. ✗

3. x SW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From our derived constraints, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This means infy(z) <= infy(x). And for a region x, infy(x) <= supy(x) (the lower bound is not above the upper bound). So, infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) required for SW. ✗
   
4. x N z: This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible given our constraints. ✗
   
5. x S z: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible given our constraints. ✗
   
6. x B z: This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From our derived constraints, supx(x) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) required for B. ✗
   
7. x E z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From our derived constraints, supx(x) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). This contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) required for E. ✗
   
8. x NE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible given our constraints. ✗
   
9. x SE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible given our constraints. ✗

Based on my systematic analysis, it seems like the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is W.

Actually, let me check again to be sure.

When we say x is W of y (x W y), it doesn't mean that x is directly aligned with y on the y-axis. It only means that x is to the west of y on the x-axis, and y doesn't extend above or below x on the y-axis. Similarly, y W z. Given these conditions, I'm trying to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Wait, actually, I didn't define NW properly:
x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(a).

The condition is supy(z) <= infy(a), which doesn't make sense. Let me check the correct definition:

x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

So, it means that x must be to the west of z on the x-axis, and below z on the y-axis.

But the definition of W:

x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

So, for x to be W of z, x should be to the west of z on the x-axis, and z shouldn't extend above or below x on the y-axis.

Hmm, but didn't I derive:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (constraints on the lower y-bounds)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (constraints on the upper y-bounds)

If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then z can extend both above and below x on the y-axis. Let's double-check my derivation:

For infy:
- From x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y)
So, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).

For supy:
- From x W y: supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y W z: supy(y) <= supy(z)
So, supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z).

OK, that checks out. Now, using these constraints, I'll reanalyze:

1. x W z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - All three conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints. ✓

2. x NW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have supx(x) <= infx(z) from our derived constraints. ✓
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), we have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) from our derived constraints. So, supy(z) >= supy(x).
   - For a valid region x, infy(x) <= supy(x).
   - Combining, we get supy(z) >= supy(x) >= infy(x).
   - This contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) required for NW. ✗

So, we've determined that x could be W of z, but it cannot be NW of z based on the given constraints. Let's continue checking:

3. x N z: This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), as we've shown, supy(z) >= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement. ✗

4. x NE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). This means supx(z) >= infx(z) >= supx(x). For a valid region x, infx(x) <= supx(x). So, supx(z) >= supx(x) >= infx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x). ✗
   - Additionally, the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) is not satisfied, as we've shown. ✗

5. x E z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), as we've shown, this contradicts our derived constraints. ✗

6. x SE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), as we've shown, this contradicts our derived constraints. ✗
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints. This means supy(x) <= infy(z) only if supy(x) <= infy(x). But for a valid region x, infy(x) <= supy(x). So, supy(x) can't be less than infy(x). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible. ✗

7. x S z: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), as we've shown, this isn't possible. ✗

8. x SW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We have supx(x) <= infx(z) from our derived constraints. ✓
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), as we've shown, this isn't possible. ✗

9. x B z: This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) from our derived constraints. ✓
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z). For a valid region x, infx(x) <= supx(x). So, infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x). ✗

Based on the systematic analysis of each cardinal direction relation, it looks like only the W relation is possible between x and z, given the constraints from x W y and y W z.

Ah, I think I see an issue I've been making. When I derive a constraint like supy(x) <= supy(z), it doesn't mean they have to be equal. Similarly, infy(z) <= infy(x) doesn't mean they have to be equal. Therefore, the projections of x and z on the y-axis can overlap in various ways, as long as they satisfy the constraints. I derived:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (constraints on the lower y-bounds)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (constraints on the upper y-bounds)

Actually, let me re-think this more carefully. Consider the constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) required for the NW relation.

From our derived constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(x). If the y-projections of x and z don't overlap, it's possible that supy(z) < infy(x). This would satisfy the NW relation.

Similarly, for the SW relation, the requirement is supy(x) <= infy(z). From our derived constraints, we have supy(x) <= supy(z). If the y-projections of x and z don't overlap, it's possible that supy(x) < infy(z), which would satisfy the SW relation.

Let me reconsider.

Given:
- x W y
- y W z

The derived constraints are:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the lower bound of x is not below the lower bound of z on the y-axis)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the upper bound of x is not above the upper bound of z on the y-axis)

These constraints are compatible with the W relation. But can they support any other relations?

For the NW relation, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already satisfied from the derived constraints)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Is this second condition possible, given the derived constraints? Let's consider the constraints we have:
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

For a valid region z, infy(z) <= supy(z). So, from the first constraint, infy(z) <= infy(x). And if the regions z and x don't overlap on the y-axis, then supy(z) < infy(x). This would satisfy the condition for the NW relation.

Similarly, for the SW relation, the requirement is supy(x) <= infy(z). Given the derived constraints, this is possible if the regions x and z don't overlap on the y-axis in the opposite way.

However, these are conditional possibilities. We need to check if the non-overlapping scenarios I'm describing are compatible with the given W relations.

If x W y, it means the y-projections of x and y overlap. Similarly, if y W z, the y-projections of y and z overlap. Given these constraints, it's uncertain whether the y-projections of x and z can be non-overlapping.

Let's see if I can construct a valid scenario.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x W y and y W z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (for NW relation)

Hmm, the last condition seems to be in conflict. We have:
- supy(y) <= supy(z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

Let's combine:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, supy(z) >= supy(x). And for the NW relation, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). For this to be true, we need supy(x) <= infy(x), which is not possible for a valid region x.

So, x can't be NW of z if both x W y and y W z.

Similarly, for x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x W y and y W z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (for SW relation)

Let's see. We have:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)

Combining:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

So, infy(z) <= infy(x). And for the SW relation, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). For this to be true, we need supy(x) <= infy(x), which is not possible for a valid region x.

So, x can't be SW of z if both x W y and y W z. 

I've been through most of the directional relations, and it looks like the W relation is the most consistent with the given constraints. But let me check a couple more to be thorough.

For the B relation, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From our derived constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which means x is strictly to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the lower bound of x is not below the lower bound of z on the y-axis)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the upper bound of x is not above the upper bound of z on the y-axis)

The first constraint of the B relation (infx(z) <= infx(x)) contradicts our derived constraint (supx(x) <= infx(z)), since for a valid region x, infx(x) <= supx(x). So, x can't be B of z.

Let me check one more relation, the N relation. For this, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z on the y-axis)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (z doesn't extend to the left or right of x on the x-axis)

The first condition for N is the same as the one for NW, which we've shown is not possible. So, x can't be N of z either.

Given all these checks, it looks like the W relation is the only valid possibility for the relationship between x and z, given x W y and y W z.

Actually, let me double-check by trying to set up a concrete example. If x, y, and z have coordinates as follows:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3
y: infx(y) = 5, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 4
z: infx(z) = 9, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 5

Then:
- supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 5 and infy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 4. So, x W y.
- supx(y) = 6 <= infx(z) = 9 and infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 4 <= supy(z) = 5. So, y W z.

And for the relationship between x and z:
- supx(x) = 2 <= infx(z) = 9 and infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 3 <= supy(z) = 5. So, x W z.

Actually, let's try to set up an example, but this time aiming for a relation other than W:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 7
y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 4, supy(y) = 8
z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 5

Then:
- supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 which is good. But infy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 6 which is good. And supy(x) = 7 <= supy(y) = 8 which is good. So, x W y. ✓
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 which is good. But infy(z) = 2 <= infy(y) = 4 which is also fine. And supy(y) = 8 <= supy(z) = 5 which is not true. So, y W z. ✗

Actually, let me go back to the basic definitions and try to derive insights from there. We are given:

- x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. W (West): x W z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From the given conditions, supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z). Combining, we get supx(x) <= infx(z). ✓
   - Similarly, infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). Combining, we get infy(z) <= infy(x). ✓
   - And, supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). Combining, we get supy(x) <= supy(z). ✓
   - All three conditions for x W z are satisfied. So, x can be W of z. ✓

2. NW (North West): x NW z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - From the given conditions, we have supx(x) <= infx(z). ✓
   - Now, for supy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have a direct relation from the given conditions. Let's see if we can derive it. 
   - From the given conditions, we have supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). Combining, we get supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For a valid region x, infy(x) <= supy(x). So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This means infy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) required for NW. ✗

3. SW (South West): x SW z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From the given conditions, we have supx(x) <= infx(z). ✓
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) from the given conditions. This means infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For a valid region x, infy(x) <= supy(x). So, infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This means infy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) required for SW. ✗

4. N (North): x N z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - From our analysis of NW, we know that supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible given the conditions. ✗

5. S (South): x S z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - From our analysis of SW, we know that supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible given the conditions. ✗

6. B (Bounding Box): x B z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From the given conditions, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). ✓
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z) from the given conditions. This means supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - For a valid region x, infx(x) <= supx(x). So, infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). This means infx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) required for B. ✗

7. E (East): x E z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). ✓
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z) from the given conditions. This means supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - For a valid region z, infx(z) <= supx(z). So, supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). This means supx(x) <= supx(z). For the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). But from the earlier derivation, supx(x) <= supx(z). For both to be true, supx(x) = supx(z) = infx(x). But this means x is reduced to a vertical line, which is not a valid region. ✗

8. NE (North East): x NE z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - From our analysis of E, we know that supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible given the conditions. ✗

9. SE (South East): x SE z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From our analysis of E, we know that supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible given the conditions.
   - From our analysis of SW, we know that supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible given the conditions. ✗

Based on this thorough analysis, it looks like the only possible relation between x and z, given x W y and y W z, is the W relation.

However, I'm pausing to think if I'm missing something. 

The deductions I have for why other relations are not possible are sound. For all the combinations and the direct derivations we can make from the conditions x W y and y W z, it appears that only the W relation is compatible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: W.

Actually, I just had another thought. Let me re-check the NW relation more carefully. For the NW relation, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

From our given conditions, we derived:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which satisfies the first condition)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which means the upper bound of x is not above the upper bound of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which means the lower bound of x is not below the lower bound of z)

The last two derived constraints tell us about the overlap of the y-projections of x and z. But I noticed that it doesn't strictly rule out the possibility that x is entirely above z on the y-axis, which would make x NW of z.

Let's try to construct a concrete example:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 7
y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 8
z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 5

Let's check the conditions:
- For x W y: supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 ✓, infy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 6 ✓, and supy(x) = 7 <= supy(y) = 8 ✓. So, x W y.
- For y W z: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 ✓, infy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 3 ✓, and supy(y) = 8 <= supy(z) = 5 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the condition for y W z.

Let me adjust the values:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 7
y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 4
z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 5

Now, let's check the conditions:
- For x W y: supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 ✓, infy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 6 ✓, and supy(x) = 7 <= supy(y) = 4 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the condition for x W y.

It seems a bit tricky to find a valid example for x NW z while maintaining x W y and y W z.

Actually, I think I jumped the gun by saying x cannot be NW of z. Let me re-analyze the conditions more carefully.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

From the given conditions, we derived:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which satisfies the first condition)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which means the upper bound of x is not above the upper bound of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which means the lower bound of x is not below the lower bound of z)

From these, I concluded that supy(z) cannot be less than or equal to infy(x), but I want to double-check this.

We have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). These don't directly tell us about the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x), which would mean x is completely above z on the y-axis.

Actually, the conditions allows for a variety of arrangements, not just overlapping. We can have disjoint regions on the y-axis. Let me see:

If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then the y-projection of z ends before the y-projection of x begins, which means z is completely below x on the y-axis. This is consistent with the NW relation.

Now, I try to construct an example:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 7
y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 8
z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 4

Let's check the conditions:
- For x W y: supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 ✓, infy(y) = 5 <= infy(x) = 6 ✓, and supy(x) = 7 <= supy(y) = 8 ✓. So, x W y.
- For y W z: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 ✓, infy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 5 ✓, and supy(y) = 8 <= supy(z) = 4 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the condition for y W z.

Let me adjust the values:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 7
y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 5
z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 4

Now, let's check the conditions:
- For x W y: supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 ✓, infy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 6 ✓, and supy(x) = 7 <= supy(y) = 5 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the condition for x W y.

Let me try again:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 7
y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 8
z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 4

Now, for the conditions:
- For x W y: supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 ✓, infy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 5 ✓, and supy(x) = 7 <= supy(y) = 8 ✓. So, x W y.
- For y W z: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 ✓, infy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 3 ✓, and supy(y) = 8 <= supy(z) = 4 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the condition for y W z.

It's turning out to be tricky to find a valid example for all the constraints. Let's continue to refine:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6
y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 6
z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 4

For the conditions:
- For x W y: supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 ✓, infy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 5 ✓, and supy(x) = 6 <= supy(y) = 6 ✓. So, x W y.
- For y W z: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 ✓, infy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 3 ✓, and supy(y) = 6 <= supy(z) = 4 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the condition for y W z.

Let me change this once more:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6
y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 4
z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 4

For the conditions:
- For x W y: supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 ✓, infy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 5 ✓, and supy(x) = 6 <= supy(y) = 4 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the condition for x W y.

It's getting a bit challenging to find an example where all conditions are met.

Let's try once more:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6
y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 4, supy(y) = 7
z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 8

For the conditions:
- For x W y: supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 ✓, infy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 ✓, and supy(x) = 6 <= supy(y) = 7 ✓. So, x W y. ✓
- For y W z: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 ✓, infy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 4 ✓, and supy(y) = 7 <= supy(z) = 8 ✓. So, y W z. ✓
- Now, for the relationship between x and z:
  - supx(x) = 2 <= infx(z) = 5 ✓, infy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) = 5 ✓, and supy(x) = 6 <= supy(z) = 8 ✓. This satisfies the conditions for x W z. ✓
  - For x NW z, we need supx(x) = 2 <= infx(z) = 5 (which is satisfied) and supy(z) = 8 <= infy(x) = 5 (which is not satisfied). So, x is not NW of z. ✗

Let me try one more arrangement:

x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 9, supy(x) = 10
y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 10
z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 6

For the conditions:
- For x W y: supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 ✓, infy(y) = 5 <= infy(x) = 9 ✓, and supy(x) = 10 <= supy(y) = 10 ✓. So, x W y. ✓
- For y W z: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 ✓, infy(z) = 2 <= infy(y) = 5 ✓, and supy(y) = 10 <= supy(z) = 6 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the condition for y W z.

I've played with a few examples, and I still have not found a valid example where x could be NW of z or SW of z given the conditions x W y and y W z. This reinforces my conviction that W is indeed the only possible relation between x and z under the given conditions.

Let me revisit the SW relation to see if I may have rushed:

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

From the original conditions, we derived:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which satisfies the first condition)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which means the lower bound of x is not below the lower bound of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which means the upper bound of x is not above the upper bound of z)

From these, I concluded that supy(x) cannot be less than or equal to infy(z). Let me check this again:

We have infy(z) <= infy(x). For regions, the lower y-bound is less than or equal to the upper y-bound: infy(x) <= supy(x). Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). So, infy(z) <= supy(x), which means supy(x) cannot be less than infy(z). This makes the SW relation impossible.

I think I've done a thorough analysis, and the W relation is the only possibility for the relationship between x and z, given x W y and y W z.

In summary, the possible relations between region x and region z, given the conditions x W y and y W z, are: W (West).

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Given:
- x is W of y (x W y)
- y is W of z (y W z)

From these, I can derive:
- From x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

These three derived constraints match exactly the definition of the W relation:
x W z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

All other cardinal direction relations would violate at least one of these constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: W
