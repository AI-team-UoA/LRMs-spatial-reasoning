PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step. 

We're given that:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is B of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions:

x SE y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)

This means x is to the southeast of y: x is both to the east (right) and to the south (below) of y.

y B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means y is inside the bounding box of z. In other words, z's bounding box completely contains y's bounding box.

Now, let's reason about the possible relations between x and z.

Since x is SE of y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

Since y is B of z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's bounding box extends at least as far left as y's)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z's bounding box extends at least as far right as y's)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bounding box extends at least as far down as y's)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's bounding box extends at least as far up as y's)

Now, let's combine these to determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. We know supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z). This doesn't give us a definitive relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). x could be to the east of z, or it could overlap with z in the x-dimension.

2. We know supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z). Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but this doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that x is to the south of z, or it could overlap with z in the y-dimension.

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

- SE: x is to the southeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), but we don't know for sure if supx(z) <= infx(x). Similarly, we know supy(x) <= infy(y), but we don't know for sure if supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x could be SE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

- E: x is to the east of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), but we don't know for sure if supx(z) <= infx(x). We also don't have direct constraints on infy(x) or supy(z). So, x could be E of z, but it's not guaranteed.

- S: x is to the south of z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). From our constraints, we know supy(x) <= infy(y), but we don't know for sure if supy(x) <= infy(z). We also don't have direct constraints on infx(x) or supx(x). So, x could be S of z, but it's not guaranteed.

Let's think about more cases:

- B: x is inside the bounding box of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which doesn't directly constrain infx(x) relative to infx(z). And we know supy(x) <= infy(y), which doesn't directly constrain infy(x) relative to infy(z). So, x could be B of z, but it's not guaranteed.

- SW: x is to the southwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which doesn't directly constrain supx(x) relative to infx(z). And we know supy(x) <= infy(y), but we don't know for sure if supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x could be SW of z, but it's not guaranteed.

- W: x is to the west of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which doesn't directly constrain supx(x) relative to infx(z). We also don't have direct constraints on infy(x) or supy(z). So, x could be W of z, but it's not guaranteed.

- NW: x is to the northwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which doesn't directly constrain supx(x) relative to infx(z). And we know supy(x) <= infy(y), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for the NW relation. So, x cannot be NW of z.

- N: x is to the north of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). From our constraints, we know supy(x) <= infy(y), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for the N relation. So, x cannot be N of z.

- NE: x is to the northeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), but we don't know for sure if supx(z) <= infx(x). And we know supy(x) <= infy(y), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for the NE relation. So, x cannot be NE of z.

Wait, I think I was making an error in my reasoning. Let me be more careful in applying the definition and considering the constraints.

Actually, let's tackle this differently: let's consider specific configurations of x, y, and z and determine the relation between x and z in each case.

Case 1: Let's assume z's bounding box is exactly the same as y's bounding box. In this case, since x is SE of y, it would also be SE of z.

Case 2: Let's assume z's bounding box extends beyond y's bounding box only to the right (east). In this case, it's possible that x is S of z (if x is to the south of both y and z, but z's extended boundary now overlaps with x in the x-dimension).

Case 3: Let's assume z's bounding box extends beyond y's bounding box only downwards (south). In this case, it's possible that x is E of z (if x is to the east of both y and z, but z's extended boundary now overlaps with x in the y-dimension).

Case 4: Let's assume z's bounding box extends beyond y's bounding box both to the right (east) and downwards (south). In this case, it's possible that x is inside the bounding box of z (i.e., x B z).

On second thought, let me focus on what the constraints directly imply:

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's bounding box extends at least as far left as y's)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z's bounding box extends at least as far right as y's)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bounding box extends at least as far down as y's)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's bounding box extends at least as far up as y's)

Combining these, we can infer:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y and y B z). This means that infx(z) < infx(x), but we don't know the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from x SE y and y B z). This means that infy(z) and supy(x) are both less than or equal to infy(y), but we don't know their relative order.

Let me use this to determine the possible relations:

1. SE: x is to the southeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). 
   We know infx(z) < infx(x), but we don't know for sure if supx(z) <= infx(x). Similarly, we know supy(x) <= infy(y), but we don't know for sure if supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x could be SE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

2. E: x is to the east of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). 
   We know infx(z) < infx(x), but we don't know for sure if supx(z) <= infx(x). We also don't have direct constraints on infy(x) or a direct relation between supy(x) and supy(z). So, x could be E of z, but it's not guaranteed.

3. S: x is to the south of z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). 
   We know infx(z) < infx(x), which aligns with the condition for S. We also know supy(x) <= infy(y), but we don't know for sure if supy(x) <= infy(z). We also don't have a direct relation between supx(x) and supx(z). So, x could be S of z, but it's not guaranteed.

4. B: x is inside the bounding box of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). 
   We know infx(z) < infx(x), which aligns with one condition for B. We don't have direct constraints on supx(x) relative to supx(z) or infy(x) relative to infy(z). So, x could be B of z, but it's not guaranteed.

5. SW: x is to the southwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). 
   We know infx(z) < infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for the SW relation. So, x cannot be SW of z.

6. W: x is to the west of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). 
   We know infx(z) < infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for the W relation. So, x cannot be W of z.

7. NW: x is to the northwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). 
   We know infx(z) < infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for the NW relation. So, x cannot be NW of z.

8. N: x is to the north of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). 
   We know infx(z) < infx(x), which aligns with one condition for N. But we also know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the condition for x to be north of z, which requires infy(x) to be greater than supy(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

9. NE: x is to the northeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). 
   We know infx(z) < infx(x), but we don't know for sure if supx(z) <= infx(x). However, similar to the reasoning for N, we can say that supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for the NE relation. So, x cannot be NE of z.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, E, S, and B.

Let me double-check this by considering specific configurations:

1. SE: This is possible when z's bounding box doesn't extend too far right or down, so x is still to the southeast of z.
2. E: This is possible when z's bounding box extends down to encompass x in the y-dimension, but not far enough right to encompass x in the x-dimension.
3. S: This is possible when z's bounding box extends right to encompass x in the x-dimension, but not far enough down to encompass x in the y-dimension.
4. B: This is possible when z's bounding box extends both right and down enough to completely encompass x.

Let's refine our analysis using the constraints more directly:

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's bounding box extends at least as far left as y's)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z's bounding box extends at least as far right as y's)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bounding box extends at least as far down as y's)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's bounding box extends at least as far up as y's)

Now, let's check each cardinal direction relation to see if the constraints allow or contradict it:

1. SE: x is to the southeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
   If supx(z) = supx(y), then supx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies one condition for x SE z.
   If supx(z) > supx(y), then we don't know for sure if supx(z) <= infx(x).
   Similarly, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
   If infy(z) = infy(y), then supy(x) <= infy(z), which satisfies the other condition for x SE z.
   If infy(z) < infy(y), then we don't know for sure if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   So, x could be SE of z, depending on the exact positions.

2. E: x is to the east of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Similar to the reasoning for SE, x could be E of z, depending on the exact positions.

3. S: x is to the south of z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From our constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) <= infx(x).
   This satisfies one condition for x S z. The other conditions are similar to the reasoning for SE and E.
   So, x could be S of z, depending on the exact positions.

4. B: x is inside the bounding box of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Again, similar to the above, x could be B of z, depending on the exact positions.

5. SW: x is to the southwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   From our constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x).
   This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which in turn means it's not possible for supx(x) to be less than or equal to infx(z).
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

6. W: x is to the west of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Similar to the reasoning for SW, x cannot be W of z.

7. NW: x is to the northwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Similar to the reasoning for SW, x cannot be NW of z.

8. N: x is to the north of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From our constraints, we know supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
   This means supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).
   So, supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for the N relation.
   So, x cannot be N of z.

9. NE: x is to the northeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Similar to the reasoning for N, x cannot be NE of z.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, E, S, and B.

Wait, I should re-evaluate if X can be "NE" of z. Let's see:

NE: x is to the northeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

We know:
- x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

Given that supx(y) <= supx(z), if supx(z) is much larger than supx(y), it may not satisfy supx(z) <= infx(x).

Given that supy(y) <= supy(z), we have supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).
This implies supy(x) <= supy(z), which means x cannot be to the north of z in any way (neither N, NE, nor NW).

To be more rigorous, let's see if the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) can be satisfied.

We know supy(x) <= infy(y) from x SE y.
We also know supy(y) <= supy(z) from y B z.

Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

We're trying to determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) can be satisfied.

If we assume supy(z) <= infy(x), then combined with the known supy(x) <= infy(y), we would have:
supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)

No direct contradiction emerges, but let's explore further.

We know supy(y) <= supy(z) from y B z. If supy(y) < supy(z), then supy(z) would be strictly greater than supy(y). And since infy(x) is not directly constrained by our given conditions in relation to supy(y) or supy(z), it's possible for infy(x) to be between supy(y) and supy(z), meaning supy(y) < infy(x) < supy(z). In this case, we wouldn't have supy(z) <= infy(x).

However, we know from the SE relation that supy(x) <= infy(y). Given that y is a region (not just a point), infy(y) < supy(y). So, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z).

Actually, in a NE relation, we'd need x to be to the north of z. Since x is SE of y, it's to the south of y. And since y is B of z, it's "inside" z, which means both y and x are to the south of the northern boundary of z. So, x cannot be to the north of z, which means it can't be NE of z.

OK actually I think I was right the first time. Let's review to be sure:

NE: x is to the northeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

We know:
- x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

From y B z, we know supy(y) <= supy(z).
From x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y).

For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z's upper y-bound should be below x's lower y-bound. But from our constraints, we don't have direct restrictions on infy(x), so we can't directly infer if this condition is met.

But what we do know is that as x is SE of y, x is below y. And since y is inside of z, y is necessarily below the upper y-bound of z. So, by transitivity, x is below the upper y-bound of z. This means supy(x) <= supy(z).

Wait let me think more clearly here:
Let's consider what we know about the y-coordinates:
From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
From y B z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) ...

Actually, let's just think about it a different way. For x to be NE of z, x needs to be both to the north and to the east of z. 

But we know:
- x is to the southeast of y (so it's to the south of y)
- y is inside the bounding box of z (which means y is to the south of the northern boundary of z)

By transitivity, x must be to the south of the northern boundary of z, which means x can't be to the north of z.

Therefore, x cannot be NE of z.

I think I need to re-examine once more:

Let's stick with our original constraints and see if x can be NE of z:

For x to be NE of z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

For the first condition, we know:
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y B z: supx(y) <= supx(z)

Given that supx(y) <= supx(z), it's not guaranteed that supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the second condition, we know:
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y B z: supy(y) <= supy(z)

We're trying to determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) can be true.

Given that supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y), we're essentially asking if supy(z) <= infy(x) can be true simultaneously with supy(x) <= infy(y).

Now, for any region, we know that infy <= supy. That is, the lower y-bound of a region is less than or equal to its upper y-bound.

So, for region x, we have infy(x) <= supy(x).
Combining this with supy(x) <= infy(y) from our constraints, we get infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y).

Now, if we were to have supy(z) <= infy(x) (the condition for x to be NE of z), then combining with the above, we'd get supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y).

But from y B z, we know supy(y) <= supy(z). So, we have supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y).

This leads to supy(y) <= infy(y), which is a contradiction because for any region, we know that infy < supy.
Therefore, it's not possible for x to be NE of z.

Actually, there's an error in my reasoning. Let me correct.

For region y, we know infy(y) <= supy(y).
Adding this to our chain, we actually get supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y).

This implies supy(y) <= supy(y), which is a true statement, so there's no direct contradiction there.

But we also have supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y), which implies supy(z) <= infy(y).

Now, from y B z, we know supy(y) <= supy(z). So, we have supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(y).

This implies supy(y) <= infy(y), which is a contradiction for any region.

Therefore, x cannot be NE of z.

So, again, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, E, S, and B.

Actually, I think I made a mistake in the way I combined these. Let's be more systematic.

We have a bunch of constraints that may or may not be simultaneously satisfiable. But let me use the definitions more directly:

For x to be NE of z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x)

For the first condition, we know from x SE y that supx(y) <= infx(x). Given y B z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z). So, if supx(z) is much larger than supx(y), it might not be true that supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the second condition, we know from x SE y that supy(x) <= infy(y), which means x is below y. From y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means z extends above y. For x to be to the north of z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x. But this contradicts our understanding that x is below y and y is below the top of z. So, x cannot be to the north of z, which means it can't be NE of z.

Similarly, x cannot be N or NW of z, because it can't be to the north of z.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

Similar to the NE case, the first condition is not guaranteed. For the second condition, from x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y), and from y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y). So, it's possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true, allowing x to be to the south of z.

Based on this reasoning and similar analysis for the other cardinal directions, the possible relations between x and z are:

- SE (Southeast): If both supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z) can be satisfied.
- E (East): If supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) can be satisfied.
- S (South): If supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z) can be satisfied.
- B (Bounding box): If infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) can be satisfied.

The relations SW, W, NW, N, and NE cannot be satisfied based on our constraints.

Actually, wait.  I think I need to check one more time if x could be E of z.

For x to be E of z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends downward at least as far as x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z) (x doesn't extend above z)

For the first condition, given that x is SE of y and y is B of z, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). As mentioned earlier, if supx(z) is much larger than supx(y), the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) might not be satisfied.

For the second condition, we know from y B z that infy(z) <= infy(y). But we don't have direct constraints relating infy(x) and infy(y) or infy(x) and infy(z). So, it's possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) to be true.

For the third condition, given that x is SE of y, supy(x) <= infy(y), and given that y is B of z, supy(y) <= supy(z). So, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z), satisfying the third condition for x to be E of z.

So, it's possible for x to be E of z if all the conditions can be satisfied.

Similarly, let's check if x could be S of z:

For x to be S of z, we need:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (z extends to the left at least as far as x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z) (x doesn't extend to the right beyond z)

For the first condition, we know from x SE y that supy(x) <= infy(y), and from y B z, infy(z) <= infy(y). If infy(z) = infy(y), then supy(x) <= infy(z), satisfying the first condition. But if infy(z) < infy(y), then it's not guaranteed that supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the second condition, from y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y). From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies infx(y) < infx(x) (since for any region, infx < supx). So, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < infx(x), satisfying the second condition.

For the third condition, we don't have direct constraints on supx(x) relative to supx(z). If supx(x) is much larger than supx(z), then the condition might not be satisfied.

So, it's possible for x to be S of z if all the conditions can be satisfied.

Moving on to check if x could be SE of z:

For x to be SE of z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

For the first condition, it might not be satisfied if supx(z) is much larger than supx(y), as explained earlier.

For the second condition, as explained in the S case, it's not guaranteed that supy(x) <= infy(z) if infy(z) < infy(y).

So, it's possible for x to be SE of z if all the conditions can be satisfied.

Finally, let's check if x could be B (inside) of z:

For x to be B of z, we need:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x) (z extends to the left at least as far as x)
2. supx(x) <= supx(z) (x doesn't extend to the right beyond z)
3. infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends downward at least as far as x)
4. supy(x) <= supy(z) (x doesn't extend above z)

For the first condition, as explained in the S case, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < infx(x), satisfying this condition.

For the second condition, we don't have direct constraints on supx(x) relative to supx(z). If supx(x) is much larger than supx(z), then the condition might not be satisfied.

For the third condition, as mentioned in the E case, it's possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) to be true.

For the fourth condition, as explained in the E case, we have supy(x) <= supy(z), satisfying this condition.

So, it's possible for x to be B of z if all the conditions can be satisfied.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are SE, E, S, and B.

I'm still worried about the SE case, let's see more clearly:

For x to be SE of z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

Let's look at whether these conditions can be satisfied based on the given constraints.

For the first condition, we know from x SE y that supx(y) <= infx(x). And from y B z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z). Given that supx(y) <= supx(z), it's possible that supx(z) > infx(x), which would violate the condition for x to be east of z.

However, if supx(z) = supx(y), then we would have supx(z) = supx(y) <= infx(x), which would ensure that x is to the east of z.

For the second condition, we know from x SE y that supy(x) <= infy(y). And from y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y). Given that infy(z) <= infy(y), it's possible that infy(z) < supy(x), which would violate the condition for x to be south of z.

However, if infy(z) = infy(y), then we would have supy(x) <= infy(y) = infy(z), which would ensure that x is to the south of z.

So, if both of these conditions are met (supx(z) = supx(y) and infy(z) = infy(y)), then x can be SE of z. But if either condition is not met, x might not be SE of z.

That covers SE. Let's check E, S, and B as well.

For x to be E of z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends downward at least as far as x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z) (x doesn't extend above z)

I've already discussed the first and third conditions above. For the second condition, we know from y B z that infy(z) <= infy(y). But we don't have direct constraints relating infy(x) and infy(y). It's possible that infy(x) < infy(y), in which case we might have infy(z) > infy(x), violating the condition for x to be E of z.

But if infy(x) >= infy(y), then we would have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), ensuring that z extends downward at least as far as x.

So, x can be E of z if these conditions are met.

For x to be S of z, we need:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (z extends to the left at least as far as x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z) (x doesn't extend to the right beyond z)

I've already discussed the first condition above. For the second condition, we know from x SE y that supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies infx(y) < infx(x). And from y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y). So, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < infx(x), ensuring that z extends to the left at least as far as x.

For the third condition, we don't have direct constraints on supx(x) relative to supx(z). If supx(x) > supx(z), then this condition would be violated. But if supx(x) <= supx(z), then x can be S of z, provided the other conditions are met.

For x to be B of z, we need:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x) (z extends to the left at least as far as x)
2. supx(x) <= supx(z) (x doesn't extend to the right beyond z)
3. infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends downward at least as far as x)
4. supy(x) <= supy(z) (x doesn't extend above z)

I've already discussed the first and fourth conditions above. For the second condition, if supx(x) > supx(z), then this condition would be violated. Otherwise, it can be satisfied.

For the third condition, as I mentioned in the E case, if infy(x) < infy(y) and infy(z) < infy(y), then we might have infy(z) > infy(x), violating this condition. But if infy(x) >= infy(y), then we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), ensuring that z extends downward at least as far as x.

So, x can be B of z if these conditions are met.

To round up, the possible relations between x and z are SE, E, S, and B, though they each require specific configurations to be satisfied.

Now, based on this analysis, let's finalize:

If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then the possible relations between region x and region z are: SE, E, S, and B.

Actually I'm doubting myself about one aspect: can x be SW of z? Let's re-think this systematically.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

For the first condition, we know from x SE y that supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies infx(y) < infx(x). If supx(x) <= infx(z), as required for the SW relation, then we have supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z).

But from y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y). So, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z).

Thus, x cannot be SW of z.

Let's also quickly check if x could be W of z:

For x to be W of z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends downward at least as far as x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z) (x doesn't extend above z)

The first condition is contradicted as I showed for SW.

So, x cannot be W of z.

And finally, let's check if x could be NW of z:

For x to be NW of z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

The first condition is contradicted as I showed for SW. Plus the second condition also can't be satisfied, as I've shown earlier.

So, x cannot be NW of z.

So, to finalize: If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then the possible relations between region x and region z are: SE, E, S, and B.

Let me double check one last time that the SW, W, NW cases are impossible:

For SW, we know from x SE y that supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies infx(y) < infx(x). And from y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y). So, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < infx(x). This means x is to the east of the left boundary of z, not to the west.

Thus, x cannot be SW of z.

For W, the same reasoning applies.

For NW, in addition to the above, we know from x SE y that supy(x) <= infy(y). And from y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). So, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means x is to the south of the top boundary of z, not to the north.

Thus, x cannot be NW of z.

Alright I've covered that these configurations are not possible. Let's double check that the N and NE cases are impossible as well:

For N, we need:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (z extends to the left at least as far as x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z) (x doesn't extend to the right beyond z)

The first condition means x is to the north of z. But as I've shown before, from x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y). And from y B z, we know supy(y) <= supy(z). So, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). This means x is to the south of the top boundary of z, not to the north.

Thus, x cannot be N of z.

For NE, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

The first condition can potentially be satisfied (if supx(z) = supx(y)), but the second condition can't be, as I've shown for N.

Thus, x cannot be NE of z.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, E, S, and B.

Let me draw a final conclusion: The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: SE, E, S, and B.

Let me make sure that I'm addressing the question correctly. The question asked which of the possible cardinal direction relations could x and z have. Above, I've gone through all nine cardinal direction relations and determined which ones can be satisfied by the given constraints:

- SE, E, S, and B can be satisfied, depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z.
- SW, W, NW, N, and NE cannot be satisfied, due to conflicts with the given constraints.

So, the answer is: SE, E, S, and B.

Actually, let's triple check one more time:

For x to be SE of z, both (1) supx(z) <= infx(x) and (2) supy(x) <= infy(z) must be satisfied. If z's bounding box is positioned such that both conditions are met, then x is indeed SE of z.

For x to be E of z, supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) must be satisfied. If z's bounding box is positioned such that all three conditions are met, then x is indeed E of z.

For x to be S of z, supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z) must be satisfied. If z's bounding box is positioned such that all three conditions are met, then x is indeed S of z.

For x to be B of z (inside z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) must be satisfied. If z's bounding box is positioned such that all four conditions are met, then x is indeed inside z.

The other five directions (SW, W, NW, N, NE) have been shown to be incompatible with the given constraints.

So, the cardinal direction relations that can exist between x and z are: SE, E, S, and B.

Actually, let's take a slight visual approach for one case. When x is SE of y, it means x is placed to the southeast of y. And when y is B of z, it means y is completely inside z. So, z can extend further to the right (east) and below (south) than y. Depending on how much z extends, x could be:

- SE of z (if z doesn't extend too far east or south)
- E of z (if z extends far enough south to encompass the y-extent of x, but not far enough east to encompass the x-extent of x)
- S of z (if z extends far enough east to encompass the x-extent of x, but not far enough south to encompass the y-extent of x)
- Inside B of z (if z extends far enough in both east and south directions to encompass x)

And the other relations like SW, W, NW, N, NE aren't possible because of the relative positioning of x and y.

Ok, so I am confident that my analysis is correct. To review, I've shown through a detailed analysis of the constraints and the definitions of cardinal direction relations that the possible relations between x and z are SE, E, S, and B. I've also shown that the other five cardinal direction relations SW, W, NW, N, NE are not possible given the constraints. Thus, the answer is: SE, E, S, and B.

ANSWER:

The question asks for the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z.

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:

1) x is SE of y means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2) y is B of z means:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far left as y)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as y)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far down as y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far up as y)

Based on these constraints, let me check each possible relation between x and z:

- SE: Possible if z doesn't extend too far east or south beyond y
- E: Possible if z extends far enough south to overlap with x in the y-dimension
- S: Possible if z extends far enough east to overlap with x in the x-dimension
- B: Possible if z extends far enough in both directions to completely contain x

For the other directions:
- SW, W, NW: Impossible because x must be to the east of z's western boundary
- N, NE: Impossible because x must be to the south of z's northern boundary

The answer is: SE, E, S, B
