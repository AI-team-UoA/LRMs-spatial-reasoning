PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this logically, using the definitions of cardinal direction relations.

We're given that:
- region x is E of region y
- region y is SW of region z

We need to find possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of the relations mentioned:

For "x E y" (x is East of y):
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

For "y SW z" (y is Southwest of z):
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's see what we can derive about the relationship between x and z:

From "x E y":
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y SW z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y SW z)

But this doesn't tell us directly how infx(x) and infx(z) relate. So we can't determine a specific x-axis relationship.

Similarly:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

This means supy(y) <= infy(z), but we don't know how infy(x) and infy(z) relate directly.

Also:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

So, supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).

From this, we know that region x is completely below region z on the y-axis. But for the x-axis, we don't have a definitive constraint.

Given that:
- x is completely below z (supy(x) <= infy(z))
- We don't have a definitive x-axis constraint

Let's analyze the possible cardinal direction relations based on the relative position of x and z on the x-axis:

1. If infx(x) > supx(z), then x is to the right (east) of z. Combined with x being below z, this gives x SE z.

2. If supx(x) < infx(z), then x is to the left (west) of z. Combined with x being below z, this gives x SW z.

3. If neither of the above holds (i.e., x and z overlap on the x-axis), then x is directly below z, giving x S z.

Wait, let's think about this again more carefully. We're given that:
- x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's derive the possible constraints on region x relative to region z:

From supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we can't derive a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). Region x could be to the left, directly below, or to the right of region z.

From infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we get: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which doesn't give us a direct constraint on the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z).

From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we get: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). This tells us that region x is completely below region z on the y-axis.

So, based on the y-axis constraint (x below z) and the uncertain x-axis relationship, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

1. x S z: if x and z overlap on the x-axis.
2. x SW z: if x is to the left of z.
3. x SE z: if x is to the right of z.

But hold on, let's think about this from a different angle. We might be missing something.

Let's use the transitive properties of the cardinal direction relations to make sure:

Given that x E y and y SW z, let's visualize it:

- Region y is to the southwest of region z
- Region x is to the east of region y

This means:
- y is below and to the left of z
- x is to the right of y

Combining these, x can be:
- To the right of z (E)
- Below and to the right of z (SE)
- Below z (S)
- Below and to the left of z (SW)
- Overlapping with z's boundary (B)

To verify our above findings:

The fact that supy(x) <= infy(z) confirms that x is below z, which limits the possibilities to S, SW, and SE.

But the x-axis relationship is not constrained, so region x could be to the left, below, or to the right of region z on the x-axis. This means the possible cardinal direction relations are S, SW, and SE.

Wait, let's actually draw out some diagrams to make sure. Imagine a Cartesian plane. Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) with some arbitrary size. Given that y is SW of z, it means y is in the third quadrant (negative x, negative y) relative to z.

Now, if x is E of y, it's to the right of y (positive x relative to y). But since y is already to the left of z, region x can be:
- Still to the left of z (SW relationship)
- Directly below z (S relationship)
- To the right of z (SE relationship)

So, our conclusion is that the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- x S z
- x SW z
- x SE z

Hmm, I'm not fully convinced. Let me do a more systematic analysis.

Let's define the minimum bounding box for the three regions as:
- Region z: [infx(z), supx(z)] x [infy(z), supy(z)]
- Region y: [infx(y), supx(y)] x [infy(y), supy(y)]
- Region x: [infx(x), supx(x)] x [infy(x), supy(x)]

Given that y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

And x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

Let's derive the relationship between x and z:

From x E y and y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), we conclude supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z.

For the x-axis, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), which doesn't directly give us the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). So, x could be to the left, below, or to the right of z on the x-axis.

Given that x is definitely below z, the possible cardinal direction relations are:
1. x S z: if x and z overlap on the x-axis, meaning infx(z) <= supx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(z).
2. x SW z: if x is to the left of z, meaning supx(x) <= infx(z).
3. x SE z: if x is to the right of z, meaning supx(z) <= infx(x).

Let me sanity check by considering an example. Let's place the regions in the Cartesian plane:
- Region z: [5, 10] x [5, 10]
- Region y: [0, 3] x [0, 3]
- Region x: [4, 8] x [1, 2]

Here, y is SW of z since supx(y) = 3 <= infx(z) = 5 and supy(y) = 3 <= infy(z) = 5.
x is E of y since supx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4, infy(y) = 0 <= infy(x) = 1, and supy(x) = 2 <= supy(y) = 3.

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z:
- infy(z) = 5 > supy(x) = 2, so x is below z.
- For the x-axis, we see that infx(x) = 4 < infx(z) = 5 and supx(x) = 8 > infx(z) = 5, which means x and z overlap on the x-axis. So, in this example, x S z.

By slightly adjusting the positions, we can easily get examples for x SW z and x SE z.

Actually, I'm realizing that the possibilities are more than just S, SW, and SE. Let's think more broadly.

From the constraints we derived:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- No direct constraint on the x-axis relationship

This means:
1. x S z: if x and z overlap on the x-axis.
2. x SW z: if x is to the left of z.
3. x SE z: if x is to the right of z.

But I'm wondering if we've considered all possibilities. The only definite constraint is that x is below z. The x-axis relationship is unconstrained. So, theoretically, x could be anywhere on the x-axis relative to z.

Let's be systematic and consider all 9 possible direction relations and check if they are feasible:

1. x B z (x inside z's bounding box): This requires x and z to overlap on both axes. We've established that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), which means there's no overlap on the y-axis. So, x B z is not possible.

2. x N z (x is north of z): This requires x to be above z, but we know x is below z. So, x N z is not possible.

3. x NE z (x is northeast of z): This requires x to be above and to the right of z, but we know x is below z. So, x NE z is not possible.

4. x E z (x is east of z): This requires x to be to the right of z and overlapping on the y-axis. We know x is below z, so there's no overlap on the y-axis. So, x E z is not possible.

5. x SE z (x is southeast of z): This requires x to be below and to the right of z. We know x is below z, and x can be to the right of z. So, x SE z is a possible relation.

6. x S z (x is south of z): This requires x to be below z and overlapping on the x-axis. We know x is below z, and x can overlap with z on the x-axis. So, x S z is a possible relation.

7. x SW z (x is southwest of z): This requires x to be below and to the left of z. We know x is below z, and x can be to the left of z. So, x SW z is a possible relation.

8. x W z (x is west of z): This requires x to be to the left of z and overlapping on the y-axis. We know x is below z, so there's no overlap on the y-axis. So, x W z is not possible.

9. x NW z (x is northwest of z): This requires x to be above and to the left of z, but we know x is below z. So, x NW z is not possible.

So, the feasible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- x S z
- x SW z
- x SE z

Let's double-check our reasoning once more. I'm a bit concerned that we might be missing some subtle details.

Ok, our constraints are coming from:

x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). This confirms that x is below z.
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), which doesn't give us a direct constraint on the x-axis relationship between x and z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are determined by the y-axis constraint (x below z) and the x-axis relationship, which is unconstrained.

If x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)), then x SW z.
If x is to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), then x SE z.
If x overlaps with z on the x-axis (infx(z) <= supx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(z)), then x S z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- x S z
- x SW z
- x SE z

Hmm, I keep coming back to the same conclusion. Alright, I'm convinced.

Let's check if we missed anything by considering a few scenarios.

If y is at the extreme southwest corner of z, then:
1. x, being east of y, could still be southwest of z.
2. x, being east of y, could be directly south of z.
3. x, being east of y, could be southeast of z.

This aligns with our conclusion.

Another check: what if we try to place x inside z's bounding box?
From our constraints, we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. This makes it impossible for x to be inside z's bounding box (B relation).

Ok, I'm now fully convinced that the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- x S z
- x SW z
- x SE z

Actually, a concise way to see this is:
- y is southwest of z, so y is below and to the left of z.
- x is east of y, so x is to the right of y.
- Given these two, x is definitely below z (because y is below z and x doesn't go above y).
- But the x-axis relationship between x and z is unconstrained. Region x could be to the left, directly below, or to the right of z, leading to the relations SW, S, and SE respectively.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and SE.

Hang on. Let's be really careful about the "S" relation. For x S z:
- Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we know is true)
- Also requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

The second condition means x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection. Given our constraints, is this feasible?

We know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y SW z)

From these, we can have infx(x) > infx(z), making the "x S z" relation possible. However, I don't immediately see a constraint dictating the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

Oh wait. I was using the incorrect definition of "S". In the context of cardinal direction relations, the "S" relation doesn't necessarily mean the projections overlap. Let me go back to the definition:

For "a S b" (a is south of b):
- supy(a) <= infy(b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)

So, for "x S z", we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we know is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The second and third conditions mean x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection. Given our constraints, we need to check if this is always feasible.

Let's reassess:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y SW z)

From these, we can certainly have infx(x) > infx(z), making the "x S z" relation possible. But again, I don't immediately see a constraint dictating the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

Wait, I think the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) might not always be guaranteed, which means "x S z" might not always be a possible relation. Let me check this more carefully.

Hmm, actually, for x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which isn't guaranteed by our constraints)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which isn't guaranteed by our constraints)

Based on the constraints from x E y and y SW z, both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) aren't guaranteed. Hence, the "x S z" relation isn't always feasible. It depends on the specific positions of the regions.

There are similar constraints for x SW z and x SE z. Let's check if those can be true:

For x SW z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which isn't directly guaranteed by our constraints)

For x SE z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which isn't directly guaranteed by our constraints)

So, just like with S, the SW and SE relations aren't always feasible based solely on the constraints from x E y and y SW z.

Let's look at a different, more basic approach. We just need to visualize it.

We know:
- y is to the southwest of z
- x is to the east of y

Consider the position of x vs. z on the y-axis. Since y is SW of z, region y is below region z. Since x is E of y, region x can go as high as region y, but not higher. This means region x is also below region z.

Now, consider the position of x vs. z on the x-axis. Since y is SW of z, region y is to the left of region z. Since x is E of y, region x is to the right of region y. 

Given these, region x can be:
- Still to the left of region z (if it's only slightly to the right of region y), resulting in a SW relationship.
- Directly below region z (if it starts where region z starts horizontally and doesn't extend beyond it), resulting in an S relationship.
- To the right of region z (if it starts beyond the right edge of region z), resulting in a SE relationship.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, based on this visualization, are:
- x SW z
- x S z
- x SE z

But is the "S" relation truly feasible? For x S z, we need region x to be directly below region z, which requires the x-projection of region x to be contained within the x-projection of region z.

Let's revisit our constraints: From y SW z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z). From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y).

From these, we can deduce that region x (which is to the right of region y) can start from the left edge of region z. This means it's feasible for x's x-projection to be contained within z's x-projection, making the "x S z" relation feasible.

I'll draw a diagram to visualize it:

For y SW z:
```
  z
y
```

For x E y:
```
y x
```

Combining these, x can be directly below z, making x S z feasible:
```
  z
y x
```

Actually, let's use the definitions directly:

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

Is this feasible given our constraints?

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z) is guaranteed by the constraint supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).

For infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), we need to check if there are any constraints ensuring these.

From y SW z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z). From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). So, it's possible for infx(x) > infx(z), which violates the constraint for the "S" relation. Similarly, it's also possible for supx(x) > supx(z), which would also violate the constraint for the "S" relation.

Upon deeper thought, I realize that while "x S z" is feasible in some configurations, it's not guaranteed for all valid configurations of regions x, y, and z that satisfy the given constraints.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me consider a simpler approach.

Given that:
- y is SW of z
- x is E of y

We know for certain that:
- y is below and to the left of z
- x is to the right of y

From these, we can deduce that x is to the right of y, and y is below z. 

For the y-axis relationship between x and z, since supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z), we get supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z.

For the x-axis relationship, we know infx(x) >= supx(y) (from x E y) and infx(z) >= supx(y) (from y SW z). But these don't give us a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). So, x could be to the left, directly below, or to the right of z on the x-axis.

OK, so that means x could be:
- Below and to the left of z (SW)
- Directly below z (S)
- Below and to the right of z (SE)

Wait, do our constraints really guarantee "x S z" as a feasible relation? Let's check more rigorously.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

Actually, let's check from the beginning again to make sure I understand the problem well:

We know that:
- x E y
- y SW z

We want to find all possible relations between x and z.

Let's check the constraints for each of the nine possible relations:

1. B(x, z): This means x is inside z's bounding box. From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). So, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is completely below z. Since x and z don't overlap on the y-axis, B(x, z) is not feasible.

2. S(x, z): This means x is directly below z. We've established supy(x) <= infy(z), so x is below z. For the S relation, x's x-projection needs to be contained within z's x-projection. But the given constraints don't guarantee this. So, S(x, z) is possible, but not guaranteed for all configurations.

3. SW(x, z): This means x is below and to the left of z. We've established supy(x) <= infy(z), so x is below z. The SW relation also requires x to be to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)), but the given constraints don't ensure this. So, SW(x, z) is possible, but not guaranteed for all configurations.

4. W(x, z): This means x is to the left of z. From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). So, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is completely below z. Since x and z don't overlap on the y-axis, W(x, z) is not feasible.

5. NW(x, z): This means x is above and to the left of z. From y SW z and x E y, we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z. Since x can't be above z, NW(x, z) is not feasible.

6. N(x, z): This means x is above z. From y SW z and x E y, we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z. Since x can't be above z, N(x, z) is not feasible.

7. NE(x, z): This means x is above and to the right of z. From y SW z and x E y, we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z. Since x can't be above z, NE(x, z) is not feasible.

8. E(x, z): This means x is to the right of z. From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). So, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is completely below z. Since x and z don't overlap on the y-axis, E(x, z) is not feasible.

9. SE(x, z): This means x is below and to the right of z. We've established supy(x) <= infy(z), so x is below z. The SE relation also requires x to be to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), but the given constraints don't ensure this. So, SE(x, z) is possible, but not guaranteed for all configurations.

From the above, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: S, SW, and SE.

Can we check specific real examples? Let's determine possible positions of three regions satisfying "x E y" and "y SW z".

1. Let's say z is at [5,10] × [5,10].
2. Since y is SW of z, let's place it at [0,3] × [0,3].
3. Since x is E of y, let's place it at [4,8] × [1,2].

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z:
- x's y-projection: [1,2]
- z's y-projection: [5,10]
Since supy(x) = 2 < infy(z) = 5, x is below z.

- x's x-projection: [4,8]
- z's x-projection: [5,10]
Since infx(x) = 4 < infx(z) = 5 and supx(x) = 8 < supx(z) = 10, x overlaps with z on the x-axis. So, in this example, x SW z.

Wait, that can't be right. If infx(x) = 4 < infx(z) = 5 and supx(x) = 8 < supx(z) = 10, then the interpretation should be: the left edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z, and the right edge of x is to the left of the right edge of z. This doesn't immediately tell us if x is completely to the left of z or just overlapping.

Let's check:
- If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the left of z. In our example, supx(x) = 8 > infx(z) = 5, so x isn't entirely to the left of z.
- If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection. In our example, infx(z) = 5 > infx(x) = 4 and supx(x) = 8 < supx(z) = 10. Since infx(z) > infx(x), x's x-projection isn't fully contained within z's.

The relationship between the x-projections is basically an overlap: infx(x) < infx(z) < supx(x) < supx(z). This gives a "part of x is to the left of z and part of x is below z" scenario.

This doesn't cleanly fit into any of the single-tile cardinal direction relations. But it seems like it would be somewhere between SW and S. However, the definition says that cardinal direction relations can be an expression R_1 : ... : R_k. In this case, it would be SW:S, implying the region x spans across the SW and S tiles of the reference region z.

Actually, let's make sure I know what the 9 possible cardinal direction relations are from a single reference region: 

Given a reference region b, the 9 tiles are:
1. NW: North West of b
2. N: North of b
3. NE: North East of b
4. W: West of b
5. B: Inside the bounding box of b
6. E: East of b
7. SW: South West of b
8. S: South of b
9. SE: South East of b

Now, for the given relation "x E y" and "y SW z", let's determine the possible relation between x and z.

From "y SW z", the region y is in the tile SW of the reference region z. From "x E y", the region x is in the tile E of the region y.

Visually, if we place the reference region z at the center, region y is to the southwest of z, and region x is to the east of y.

The key constraints are:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's bottom isn't above x's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top isn't above y's top)

There's another constraint I think I've been missing:

Assuming a and b are in REG (they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk), the constraint supx(a) <= infx(b) not only means a is to the left of b, but there's a non-zero separation between them. Similarly, other constraints like supy(a) <= infy(b) mean a is strictly below b with a non-zero separation.

Let's see you the possible relationship between the x-projections of regions x and z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is strictly to the left of z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is strictly to the right of y)

These don't directly tell us the relationship between the x-projections of x and z. The relationship can be any of:
1. x is strictly to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z))
2. z is strictly to the left of x (supx(z) <= infx(x))
3. The x-projections of x and z overlap

Similarly, for the y-projections, we know region x is below region z (supy(x) <= infy(z)). 

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, taken into account all possible configurations, are:
- x SW z: if x is to the left of z
- x S z: if the x-projections of x and z overlap
- x SE z: if x is to the right of z

OK so let's clarify my answer. The possible relations between region x and region z are:
SW (if x is to the left of z)
S (if the x-projections of x and z overlap)
SE (if x is to the right of z)

I think I've thoroughly checked all possible configurations, and I'm convinced that these are the only possible relations.

Actually, as a final check, I'm going to draw a picture with the constraints to make sure I'm clear on the positions. Alternatively we can use the definitions and check what each cardinal direction relation means in terms of the projections:

We start from the constraints that x E y and y SW z.

We know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)

For x SW z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

We already know supy(x) <= infy(z) from the constraints. But for supx(x) <= infx(z), we can't derive it from our constraints. So, x SW z is a possible relation but not guaranteed for all configurations.

For x S z, we'd need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z) from the constraints. But the other two constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), can't be derived from our given constraints. So, x S z is a possible relation but not guaranteed for all configurations.

For x SE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

We already know supy(x) <= infy(z) from the constraints. But for supx(z) <= infx(x), we can't derive it from our constraints. So, x SE z is a possible relation but not guaranteed for all configurations.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
1. x SW z
2. x S z
3. x SE z

Great, finally we have a well-supported answer.

To recap: 
- y is SW of z
- x is E of y

This means:
- y is below and to the left of z
- x is to the right of y

By the constraints, we can deduce that x is below z. However, the x-axis relationship between x and z is unconstrained. x could be to the left of z, directly below z, or to the right of z.

Given the unconstrained x-axis relationship, x can have the following possible relations with z:
1. x SW z (if x is to the left of z)
2. x S z (if the x-projections of x and z overlap)
3. x SE z (if x is to the right of z)

Hmm, let me double-check on whether "S" means the x-projections need to *exactly* match or just *overlap*. Let me check the definition.

"a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)"

For the S relation the left edge of `a` is to the right of the left edge of `b` (infx(b) <= infx(a)) and the right edge of `a` is to the left of the right edge of `b` (supx(a) <= supx(b)). This means `a` is contained within `b` in terms of the x-projection. So the overlap must be "a is within b".

But what if infx(a) < infx(b) and supx(a) > supx(b)? This would mean `a` straddles `b`. Or what if infx(a) < infx(b) and supx(a) < supx(b) with supx(a) > infx(b)? This would mean `a` partially overlaps with `b`.

Actually, the definition only considers single-tile relations. In cases where regions don't fit neatly into a single tile, a concatenated relation is used: R1:...:Rk. For example, if x straddles the SW and S tiles of z, the relation would be SW:S.

Given the constraints x E y and y SW z, if we consider all possible configurations, the possible relations between x and z (including multi-tile relations) would be:
1. x SW z
2. x SW:S z
3. x S z
4. x S:SE z
5. x SE z

Hmm, wait, let's go back to the original problem:

We have "region x is E of region y" and "region y is SW of region z". The question is: "which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

Based on the cardinal direction definitions, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
1. x SW z
2. x S z
3. x SE z

Actually wait, I think there's some confusion in the problem statement. When the problem asks for the possible relations between region x and region z, I think it's asking about the nine basic cardinal direction relations: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, and SE. It's not asking about the composite relations like SW:S or S:SE.

This is going to be super simple: By the constraints, we know that x is below z. So, the possible relations are:
- SW (if x is to the left of z)
- S (if x is directly below z)
- SE (if x is to the right of z)

To address any ambiguity: In the context of cardinal direction relations, "a S b" means a is directly below b, not to the left or right. "a SW b" means a is below and to the left of b. "a SE b" means a is below and to the right of b.

Actually, the problem statement is clear. The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z. Based on the constraints in the problem, the possible relations are:
1. x SW z
2. x S z
3. x SE z

Actually, let me clarify: For the S relation, we require: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). This means a's x-projection is contained within b's x-projection, and a is below b.

For the SW relation, we require: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b). This means a is to the left of and below b.

For the SE relation, we require: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b). This means a is to the right of and below b.

The constraints in the problem guarantee that x is below z. But the x-axis relationship is unconstrained. x can be to the left of z (SW relationship), it can be to the right of z (SE relationship), or its x-projection can be contained within z's x-projection (S relationship).

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
1. x SW z
2. x S z
3. x SE z

OK, I'm convinced the solution is SW, S, and SE.

Actually, let's just check that S is possible by providing an example:

Let's place z at [5,10] × [5,10].
Since y is SW of z, place it at [0,3] × [0,3].
Since x is E of y, place it at [6,9] × [1,2].

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z): Check, 2 <= 5.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): Check, 5 <= 6.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): Check, 9 <= 10.

So, the relation between x and z in this example is x S z. We can similarly validate that x SW z and x SE z are possible by choosing different coordinates.

Therefore, the feasible relations by our defintion between x and z are:
- x SW z
- x S z
- x SE z

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine what's possible between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From these, I can derive:

First, let's analyze what these relations tell us:
- y SW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- x E y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From these constraints:
- Since supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- This means region x is definitely below region z on the y-axis

For the x-axis relationship, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is left of z)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is right of y)

But these don't directly constrain how x and z relate on the x-axis. Region x could be:
- To the left of z (giving SW relation)
- Directly below z with x-projections overlapping appropriately (giving S relation)
- To the right of z (giving SE relation)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
S, SW, SE
