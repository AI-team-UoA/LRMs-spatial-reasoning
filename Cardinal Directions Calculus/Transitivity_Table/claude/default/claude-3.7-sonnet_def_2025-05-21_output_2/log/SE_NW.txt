PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step-by-step:

First, we're given that:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions provided:
- x SE y means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y NW z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let me visualize this situation. If:
- x is SE of y: x is in the southeast quadrant relative to y
- y is NW of z: y is in the northwest quadrant relative to z

Let's consider what this means in terms of the minimum bounding boxes and coordinates:

For x SE y:
- x is to the east of y, meaning infx(x) ≥ supx(y)
- x is to the south of y, meaning supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

For y NW z:
- y is to the west of z, meaning supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- y is to the north of z, meaning supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- From x SE y and y NW z, we get: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Also, supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

This doesn't directly give us a constraint between x and z. Let's think about the possible positions.

Since y is NW of z, z is somewhere in the southeast quadrant relative to y.
Since x is SE of y, x is also in the southeast quadrant relative to y.

So both x and z are in the southeast quadrant relative to y, but their relative positions to each other could vary.

Let's consider different possible positions of x relative to z:

1. x could be east of z, meaning infx(x) ≥ supx(z)
2. x could be southeast of z, meaning infx(x) ≥ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
3. x could be south of z, meaning supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and there's overlap in the x-direction
4. x could be southwest of z, meaning supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
5. x could be west of z, meaning supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and there's overlap in the y-direction
6. x could be northwest of z, but this seems unlikely given the constraints
7. x could be north of z, but this also seems unlikely
8. x could be northeast of z, meaning infx(x) ≥ supx(z) and infy(x) ≥ supy(z)
9. x could be inside the bounding box of z (B)

Let's verify each of these possibilities by checking if they're consistent with our constraints:

Remember that we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x SE y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y NW z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SE y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NW z)

Let's examine each case:

1. x E z (East): Requires infx(x) ≥ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We have supx(y) ≤ infx(x), but we don't know the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x)
   - For the y-direction, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't constrain the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z)
   - So x E z is possible.

2. x SE z (Southeast): Requires infx(x) ≥ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - Similar to the East case, this is not directly constrained by our given information
   - x SE z is possible.

3. x S z (South): Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - We have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't directly constrain supy(x) and infy(z)
   - For the x-direction, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), but this doesn't directly constrain the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z)
   - So x S z is possible.

4. x SW z (Southwest): Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We have supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which doesn't directly constrain supx(x) and infx(z)
   - x SW z is possible.

5. x W z (West): Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - Similar to the Southwest case, this is not directly constrained by our given information
   - x W z is possible.

6. x NW z (Northwest): Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We have supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), which doesn't directly constrain supy(z) and infy(x)
   - However, since x is SE of y, it's unlikely that x would be north of z, which is SE of y
   - But it's still logically possible, so x NW z is a possibility.

7. x N z (North): Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - Similar to the Northwest case, this seems unlikely but is logically possible
   - x N z is a possibility.

8. x NE z (Northeast): Requires infx(x) ≥ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - Similar to the North case, this seems unlikely but is logically possible
   - x NE z is a possibility.

9. x B z (Inside the bounding box): Requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - This is logically possible if z is much larger than x
   - x B z is a possibility.

Actually, I think I've made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider.

Given:
- x SE y means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y NW z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

This means:
- x is to the east and south of y
- y is to the west and north of z

Visually, if we draw a coordinate system with y at the origin, then:
- x is in the southeast quadrant from y
- z is in the southeast quadrant from y

But the relative position of x and z to each other is not fixed. Let's explore the possibilities:

1. If x is to the east of z (x E z):
   - This means infx(x) ≥ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - Given our constraints, supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the first part is possible.
   - For the y-direction, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't directly constrain the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z.
   - So x E z is possible.

2. If x is to the southeast of z (x SE z):
   - This means infx(x) ≥ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - Given our constraints, the first part is possible as mentioned above.
   - For the y-direction, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), which doesn't directly constrain the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   - So x SE z is possible.

3. If x is to the south of z (x S z):
   - This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - For the y-direction, as mentioned above, x S z is possible.
   - For the x-direction, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which doesn't directly constrain the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z).
   - So x S z is possible.

4. If x is to the southwest of z (x SW z):
   - This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - Given our constraints, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
   - This means infx(x) ≥ supx(y) and infx(z) ≥ supx(y), but it doesn't directly constrain supx(x) and infx(z).
   - So x SW z is possible.

5. If x is to the west of z (x W z):
   - This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - For the x-direction, as mentioned in the Southwest case, x W z is possible.
   - For the y-direction, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), which doesn't directly constrain the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z.
   - So x W z is possible.

6, 7, 8. If x is to the northwest, north, or northeast of z:
   - These would require x to be partly or fully north of z.
   - Given that x is SE of y and y is NW of z, having x north of z would create a situation where x is north of z, which is north of y, which is north of x. This forms a cycle.
   - So x NW z, x N z, and x NE z is not possible.

Actually, I think I'm approaching this wrong. Let's start from scratch and use a clearer approach.

Given:
- x SE y
- y NW z

This means:
- x is in the southeast quadrant relative to y
- z is in the southeast quadrant relative to y (since y is NW of z, z is SE of y)

Let's be more specific. From the definitions:
- x SE y means:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

- y NW z means:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

From these, we can see that both x and z are to the east of y, and both x and z are to the south of y. But the relative positions of x and z to each other are not constrained.

Let's visualize this on a coordinate system with y at the origin (0, 0):
- The x-region (bounding box of x) is somewhere in the positive x-axis and negative y-axis (southeast quadrant).
- The z-region (bounding box of z) is also somewhere in the positive x-axis and negative y-axis (southeast quadrant).

Given this setup:
1. x could be east of z (x E z) if x is further to the east than z.
2. x could be southeast of z (x SE z) if x is further to the east and south than z.
3. x could be south of z (x S z) if x is further to the south than z.
4. x could be southwest of z (x SW z) if x is to the west of z and further to the south.
5. x could be west of z (x W z) if x is to the west of z.
6. x could be northwest of z (x NW z) if x is to the west and north of z, but still southeast of y.
7. x could be north of z (x N z) if x is to the north of z, but still southeast of y.
8. x could be northeast of z (x NE z) if x is to the east and north of z.
9. x could be inside the bounding box of z (x B z) if the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of z.

Let's verify each of these by drawing out a concrete example:

1. x E z:
   - Place y at (0, 0)
   - Place z at (1, -1)
   - Place x at (3, -1)
   - With these coordinates, x is SE of y and y is NW of z, and x is E of z.

2. x SE z:
   - Place y at (0, 0)
   - Place z at (1, -1)
   - Place x at (2, -2)
   - With these coordinates, x is SE of y, y is NW of z, and x is SE of z.

3. x S z:
   - Place y at (0, 0)
   - Place z at (1, -1)
   - Place x at (1, -2)
   - With these coordinates, x is SE of y, y is NW of z, and x is S of z.

4. x SW z:
   - This is trickier. Let's try:
   - Place y at (0, 0)
   - Place z at (3, -1)
   - Place x at (2, -2)
   - Here, x is SE of y, y is NW of z, but x is SW of z.

5. x W z:
   - Similar to the previous case:
   - Place y at (0, 0)
   - Place z at (3, -1)
   - Place x at (2, -1)
   - Here, x is SE of y, y is NW of z, and x is W of z.

6. x NW z:
   - This seems impossible because if x is NW of z, then x would be closer to y than z in both the x and y directions, but x is SE of y, which means it's further from y in both the x and y directions.

7. x N z:
   - Let's try:
   - Place y at (0, 0)
   - Place z at (2, -3)
   - Place x at (2, -2)
   - Here, x is SE of y, y is NW of z, and x is N of z.

8. x NE z:
   - Let's try:
   - Place y at (0, 0)
   - Place z at (1, -2)
   - Place x at (2, -1)
   - Here, x is SE of y, y is NW of z, and x is NE of z.

9. x B z:
   - This would mean x is completely inside the bounding box of z.
   - Let's try:
   - Place y at (0, 0)
   - Place z's bounding box as the region from (1, -1) to (3, -3)
   - Place x's bounding box as the region from (1.5, -1.5) to (2.5, -2.5)
   - Here, x is SE of y, y is NW of z, and x is inside the bounding box of z (x B z).

Let me double-check each of these against the original definitions to make sure they're valid:

1. For x E z:
   - With coordinates y at (0, 0), z at (1, -1), and x at (3, -1):
   - supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 3, so supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) = -1, infy(y) = 0, so supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)
   - supx(y) = 0, infx(z) = 1, so supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)

   - According to the definition of W, x W z is valid.

6. For x NW z:
   - I previously argued that this would be impossible, but let me try:
   - Place y at (0, 0)
   - Place z at (3, -3)
   - Place x at (2, -2)
   - supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 2, so supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)

   - supy(z) = -3, infy(y) = 0, so supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - The x-coordinates of x and z are the same, so x is neither to the east nor west of z.

   - supy(x) = -2.5, supy(z) = -1, so supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - According to the definition of B, x B z is valid.

Based on our verified examples, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- S (South)
- SW (Southwest)
- W (West)
- NW (Northwest)
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- B (Bounding Box)

So, all nine cardinal direction relations are possible.

Wait, let me double-check the definition of "B".

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

This means the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of z. In our example, we had z's bounding box as (1, -1) to (3, -3) and x's bounding box as (1.5, -1.5) to (2.5, -2.5), which satisfies the conditions for x B z.

Actually, I should verify that all of our examples satisfy the original constraints: x SE y and y NW z. Let me go through them one by one:

1. For x E z (y at (0, 0), z at (1, -1), x at (3, -1)):
   - x SE y: supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 3, supy(x) = -1, infy(y) = 0, so x SE y.
   - y NW z: supx(y) = 0, infx(z) = 1, supy(z) = -1, infy(y) = 0, so y NW z.

2. For x SE z (y at (0, 0), z at (1, -1), x at (2, -2)):
   - x SE y: supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 2, supy(x) = -2, infy(y) = 0, so x SE y.
   - y NW z: supx(y) = 0, infx(z) = 1, supy(z) = -1, infy(y) = 0, so y NW z.

3. For x S z (y at (0, 0), z at (1, -1), x at (1, -2)):
   - x SE y: supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 1, supy(x) = -2, infy(y) = 0, so x SE y.
   - y NW z: supx(y) = 0, infx(z) = 1, supy(z) = -1, infy(y) = 0, so y NW z.

4. For x SW z (y at (0, 0), z at (3, -1), x at (2, -2)):
   - x SE y: supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 2, supy(x) = -2, infy(y) = 0, so x SE y.
   - y NW z: supx(y) = 0, infx(z) = 3, supy(z) = -1, infy(y) = 0, so y NW z.

5. For x W z (y at (0, 0), z at (3, -1), x at (2, -1)):
   - x SE y: supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 2, supy(x) = -1, infy(y) = 0, so x SE y.
   - y NW z: supx(y) = 0, infx(z) = 3, supy(z) = -1, infy(y) = 0, so y NW z.

6. For x NW z (y at (0, 0), z at (3, -3), x at (2, -2)):
   - x SE y: supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 2, supy(x) = -2, infy(y) = 0, so x SE y.
   - y NW z: supx(y) = 0, infx(z) = 3, supy(z) = -3, infy(y) = 0, so y NW z.

7. For x N z (y at (0, 0), z at (2, -3), x at (2, -2)):
   - x SE y: supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 2, supy(x) = -2, infy(y) = 0, so x SE y.
   - y NW z: supx(y) = 0, infx(z) = 2, supy(z) = -3, infy(y) = 0, so y NW z.

8. For x NE z (y at (0, 0), z at (1, -2), x at (2, -1)):
   - x SE y: supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 2, supy(x) = -1, infy(y) = 0, so x SE y.

9. For x B z (y at (0, 0), z's bounding box as (1, -1) to (3, -3), x's bounding box as (1.5, -1.5) to (2.5, -2.5)):
   - x SE y: supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 1.5, supy(x) = -2.5, infy(y) = 0, so x SE y.
   - y NW z: supx(y) = 0, infx(z) = 1, supy(z) = -3, infy(y) = 0, so y NW z.

All of our examples satisfy the original constraints, and we've verified that all nine cardinal direction relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) are possible for the relationship between x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is NW of z.

Actually, I just realized I made a mistake in the definition of "B". For x B z, x is inside the bounding box of z. According to the definition provided:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So for x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's verify our example:
- infx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 1.5, so infx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
- supx(x) = 2.5, supx(z) = 3, so supx(x) <= supx(z) ✓
- infy(z) = -3, infy(x) = -1.5, but infy(x) < infy(z), so this doesn't satisfy infy(z) <= infy(x) ✗

There's a problem with our example for x B z. Let me correct it:
- Place y at (0, 0)
- Place z's bounding box as (1, -1) to (3, -3)
- Place x's bounding box as (1.5, -2.5) to (2.5, -1.5)

Now, let's verify:
- infx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 1.5, so infx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
- supx(x) = 2.5, supx(z) = 3, so supx(x) <= supx(z) ✓
- infy(z) = -3, infy(x) = -2.5, so infy(z) <= infy(x) ✓
- supy(x) = -1.5, supy(z) = -1, so supy(x) <= supy(z) ✓

With this corrected example, x B z is valid.

Now, let's also verify that this example satisfies our original constraints:
- x SE y: supx(y) = 0, infx(x) = 1.5, supy(x) = -1.5, infy(y) = 0, so x SE y.
- y NW z: supx(y) = 0, infx(z) = 1, supy(z) = -3, infy(y) = 0, so y NW z.

Yes, our corrected example satisfies the original constraints, and we have verified that all nine cardinal direction relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) are possible for the relationship between x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is NW of z.

So, all nine cardinal direction relations are possible answers.

Actually, let me check one more time about the B relation. The definition given for B is:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

This means x's bounding box is contained within z's bounding box. Given that x is SE of y and y is NW of z, is it possible for x to be inside the bounding box of z?

Let's think about this more carefully. If y is NW of z, then z is in the southeast quadrant relative to y. If x is SE of y, then x is also in the southeast quadrant relative to y. Both x and z are in the same quadrant relative to y, so it's possible for one to contain the other.

In our example:
- y is at (0, 0)
- z's bounding box is from (1, -3) to (3, -1)
- x's bounding box is from (1.5, -2.5) to (2.5, -1.5)

Here, x's bounding box is contained within z's bounding box, so x B z. And both x and z are in the southeast quadrant relative to y, satisfying the original constraints.

So, our conclusion stands: all nine cardinal direction relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) are possible for the relationship between x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is NW of z.

Sorry for the confusion and back-and-forth. Let me clarify one more time:

Given:
- x SE y
- y NW z

The possible relations between x and z are:
- B (Inside the bounding box)
- S (South)
- SW (Southwest)
- W (West)
- NW (Northwest)
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)

That is, all nine cardinal direction relations are possible.

Actually, I was thinking of this incorrectly! I need to pay more attention to the strict definitions given in the problem. Let me trace through the definitions more carefully:

The relation "x SE y" means two things:
1. supx(y) ≤ infx(x): The supremum (maximum) of y's projection on the x-axis is less than or equal to the infimum (minimum) of x's projection on the x-axis. This means x is completely to the east of y.
2. supy(x) ≤ infy(y): The supremum of x's projection on the y-axis is less than or equal to the infimum of y's projection on the y-axis. This means x is completely to the south of y.

Similarly, "y NW z" means:
1. supx(y) ≤ infx(z): y is completely to the west of z.
2. supy(z) ≤ infy(y): z is completely to the south of y.

So, if x is SE of y and y is NW of z, then:
- y is to the west of both x and z.
- y is to the north of both x and z.

This means both x and z are in the southeast quadrant relative to y, but their relative positions to each other are not constrained. Let's explore the possible relative positions of x and z:

1. x E z (East): x is completely to the east of z.
2. x SE z (Southeast): x is completely to the east and south of z.
3. x S z (South): x is completely to the south of z.
4. x SW z (Southwest): x is completely to the west and south of z.
5. x W z (West): x is completely to the west of z.
6. x NW z (Northwest): x is completely to the west and north of z.
7. x N z (North): x is completely to the north of z.
8. x NE z (Northeast): x is completely to the east and north of z.
9. x B z (Inside the bounding box): The bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of z.

Let's verify if each of these is possible given the constraints:

For each case, I'll set up coordinates to create a specific scenario and then check if it satisfies both "x SE y" and "y NW z".

Based on the above verifications, all nine cardinal direction relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) are possible for the relationship between x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is NW of z.

So, the answer to the question "If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is:

B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE

That is, all nine cardinal direction relations are possible for the relationship between x and z.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

N
NE
E
SE
S
SW
W
NW
B

All cardinal direction relations are possible. Since we know x is SE of y and y is NW of z, both x and z are in the southeast quadrant relative to y, but their positions relative to each other are not constrained. For each possible relation, we can construct a valid configuration of regions that satisfies the given constraints.
