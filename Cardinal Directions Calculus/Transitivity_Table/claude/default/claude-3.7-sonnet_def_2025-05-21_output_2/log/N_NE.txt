PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We are given that:
- region x is N of region y
- region y is NE of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

So, x N y means:
1. supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) (left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of y)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) (right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of y)

And y NE z means:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
2. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z. We know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)

Combining these, we get:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
This means supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies that x is above z.

Next, let's look at the horizontal relationship:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y NE z)

Combining these, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
This means supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies that x is to the right of z.

So, we know that x is above and to the right of z. This means x could be NE of z.

However, we need to check if there are other possible relations. Let me double-check my reasoning.

Actually, let's be more precise. We have:
- x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is NE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
1. supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x), implying x is above z.
2. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x), implying x is to the right of z.

Based on these, the relation between x and z could be NE (North East), since x is both above and to the right of z.

But let's also check if N is a possible relation:

For x N z, we need:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x) (already confirmed)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z)

We don't have direct information about infx(z) or supx(z) from the given relations, so we can't determine if conditions 2 and 3 for x N z are satisfied.

Similarly, for x E z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (already confirmed)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z)

Again, we don't have direct information about infy(z) or supy(z) from the given relations, so we can't determine if conditions 2 and 3 for x E z are satisfied.

Let's try to visualize this:

Given x N y:
The projection of x onto the y-axis is entirely above the projection of y onto the y-axis.
The projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of y onto the x-axis.

Given y NE z:
The projection of y onto the y-axis is entirely above the projection of z onto the y-axis.
The projection of y onto the x-axis is entirely to the right of the projection of z onto the x-axis.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
The projection of x onto the y-axis is entirely above the projection of z onto the y-axis (derived from both given relations).
The projection of x onto the x-axis is entirely to the right of the projection of z onto the x-axis (derived from both given relations).

But we don't know the exact positions of the projections, so multiple cardinal relations might be possible.

Let me enumerate the possible relations and check each one:

1. x N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (confirmed)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (unknown)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (unknown)

2. x NE z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (confirmed)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (confirmed)

3. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (confirmed)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (unknown)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (unknown)

4. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (confirmed)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (unknown)

5. x S z:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (unknown)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (unknown)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (unknown)

6. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (conflicts with supx(z) <= infx(x))
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (unknown)

7. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (conflicts with supx(z) <= infx(x))
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (unknown)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (unknown)

8. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (conflicts with supx(z) <= infx(x))
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (confirmed)

9. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (unknown)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (unknown)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (unknown)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (unknown)

From the analysis above, the confirmed relations between x and z are NE.

Actually, I'm not being precise enough. Let me construct a specific example to check if other relations are possible.

Imagine:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (1, 1).
- y is at (2, 2) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (2, 2) to (3, 3).
- x is at (2.5, 4) with dimensions 0.5x1, so its bounding box is (2.5, 4) to (3, 5).

In this case:
- y is NE of z (2 > 1 and 2 > 1).
- x is N of y (4 > 3, 2.5 >= 2, and 3 <= 3).
- The relation between x and z is NE (2.5 > 1 and 4 > 1).

Let's try another example:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 3x1, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (3, 1).
- y is at (4, 2) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (4, 2) to (5, 3).
- x is at (3, 4) with dimensions 2x1, so its bounding box is (3, 4) to (5, 5).

In this case:
- y is NE of z (4 > 3 and 2 > 1).
- x is N of y (4 > 3, 3 <= 4, and 5 <= 5).
- The relation between x and z is N (4 > 1, 3 >= 0, and 5 <= 5).

Here it's N! So both N and NE are possible.

Let's try another one:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 2x1, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (2, 1).
- y is at (3, 2) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (3, 2) to (4, 3).
- x is at (5, 4) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (5, 4) to (6, 5).

In this case:
- y is NE of z (3 > 2 and 2 > 1).
- x is N of y (4 > 3, 5 >= 3, and 6 <= 7). Actually, something's not right. x is not N of y here, because the horizontal projection of x is not contained within the horizontal projection of y (x is to the right of y). Let me re-check the definition.

x N y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

So x N y means:
1. supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) (left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of y)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) (right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of y)

Given the example:
- supy(y) = 3, infy(x) = 4, so 3 <= 4 (satisfied)
- infx(y) = 3, infx(x) = 5, so 3 <= 5 (satisfied)
- supx(x) = 6, supx(y) = 4, so 6 <= 4 (not satisfied)

So x is not N of y in this example. Let me correct the example:

- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 2x1, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (2, 1).
- y is at (3, 2) with dimensions 4x1, so its bounding box is (3, 2) to (7, 3).
- x is at (5, 4) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (5, 4) to (6, 5).

Now:
- y is NE of z (3 > 2 and 2 > 1).
- x is N of y (4 > 3, 5 >= 3, and 6 <= 7).
- The relation between x and z is NE (5 > 2 and 4 > 1).

So, based on my analyses, both N and NE are possible relations between x and z given the constraints.

Let's try to get E as a relation:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 2x5, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (2, 5).
- y is at (3, 2) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (3, 2) to (4, 3).
- x is at (5, 2.5) with dimensions 1x0.5, so its bounding box is (5, 2.5) to (6, 3).

In this case:
- y is NE of z (3 > 2 and 2 > 1). Hold on, this isn't correct. For y to be NE of z, it has to be completely to the right and above z. Given the dimensions, y is not entirely above z. y's y-coordinate range is [2, 3], and z's y-coordinate range is [0, 5]. So, it's not the case that supy(z) <= infy(y).

Let me correct the example:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 2x1, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (2, 1).
- y is at (3, 2) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (3, 2) to (4, 3).
- x is at (5, 0.5) with dimensions 1x2, so its bounding box is (5, 0.5) to (6, 2.5).

Now:
- y is NE of z (3 > 2 and 2 > 1).
- x is N of y (4 > 2.5, 5 >= 3, and 6 <= 7). Wait, this isn't correct either. x's y-coordinate range is [0.5, 2.5], and y's y-coordinate range is [2, 3]. So, it's not the case that supy(y) <= infy(x).

Let me try once more:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 2x1, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (2, 1).
- y is at (3, 2) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (3, 2) to (4, 3).
- x is at (3.5, 4) with dimensions 0.5x1, so its bounding box is (3.5, 4) to (4, 5).

Now:
- y is NE of z (3 > 2 and 2 > 1).
- x is N of y (3 < 4, 3.5 >= 3, and 4 <= 4).
- The relation between x and z is NE (3.5 > 2 and 4 > 1).

This still confirms NE. But I want to try to get E:

- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 2x5, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (2, 5).
- y is at (3, 3) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (3, 3) to (4, 4).
- x is at (5, 3.5) with dimensions 1x0.5, so its bounding box is (5, 3.5) to (6, 4).

In this case:
- y is NE of z (3 > 2 and 3 > 0). Wait, this isn't right. For y to be NE of z, it needs to be completely to the right and above z. z's y-coordinate range is [0, 5], and y's y-coordinate range is [3, 4]. Since y's y-coordinates fall within the range of z's y-coordinates, it's not NE.

I'm making a frequent mistake. Let me recall the definitions again:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

So, y NE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is completely to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is completely above z)

And x N y means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is completely above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of y)

Let me try once more with a simple example:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (1, 1).
- y is at (2, 2) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (2, 2) to (3, 3).
- x is at (2.5, 4) with dimensions 0.5x1, so its bounding box is (2.5, 4) to (3, 5).

In this case:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2, supy(z) = 1, infy(y) = 2. So, 1 <= 2 and 1 <= 2, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 3, infy(x) = 4, infx(y) = 2, infx(x) = 2.5, supx(x) = 3, supx(y) = 3. So, 3 <= 4, 2 <= 2.5, and 3 <= 3, which means x is indeed N of y.
- For the relation between x and z, we need to check. For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We have supx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 2.5, supy(z) = 1, infy(x) = 4. So, 1 <= 2.5 and 1 <= 4, which means x is NE of z.

So, in this example, the relation between x and z is NE.

Now let's try to find an example where the relation between x and z is N:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 5x1, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (5, 1).
- y is at (2, 2) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (2, 2) to (3, 3).
- x is at (2, 4) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (2, 4) to (3, 5).

In this case:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 5, infx(y) = 2, supy(z) = 1, infy(y) = 2. So, 5 <= 2 is false, which means y is not NE of z.

Let me adjust the coordinates of z:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (1, 1).
- y is at (2, 2) with dimensions 2x1, so its bounding box is (2, 2) to (4, 3).
- x is at (2, 4) with dimensions 2x1, so its bounding box is (2, 4) to (4, 5).

In this case:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2, supy(z) = 1, infy(y) = 2. So, 1 <= 2 and 1 <= 2, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 3, infy(x) = 4, infx(y) = 2, infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, supx(y) = 4. So, 3 <= 4, 2 <= 2, and 4 <= 4, which means x is indeed N of y.
- For the relation between x and z, we need to check. For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We have supy(z) = 1, infy(x) = 4, infx(z) = 0, infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, supx(z) = 1. So, 1 <= 4, 0 <= 2, but 4 <= 1 is false, which means x is not N of z.

Hmm, I'm having difficulty finding an example where x is N of z. Let's think about it logically.

For x N z, we need:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of z)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z) (right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of z)

Given the constraints that x N y and y NE z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which satisfies the first condition for x N z.
- By the constraint that y is NE of z, we know that y is to the right of z, i.e., supx(z) <= infx(y). This means that the left edge of y (infx(y)) is to the right of the right edge of z (supx(z)). Given that x is N of y, the left edge of x (infx(x)) is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of y (infx(y)). This means infx(x) >= infx(y) > supx(z), which implies that x is completely to the right of z. This contradicts the second condition for x N z, which requires infx(z) <= infx(x).

So, it seems that if y is NE of z, then x cannot be N of z. But let me double-check this.

The key insight is that if y is NE of z, then y is completely to the right of z. Since x is N of y, the horizontal projection of x is contained within the horizontal projection of y, which means x is also completely to the right of z. This means x cannot be N of z, because for x to be N of z, the horizontal projection of x would have to be contained within the horizontal projection of z.

But wait, let's double-check this with the formal definitions.

y NE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

x N y means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means that x is to the right of z.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is satisfied since supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x))
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which is a condition we don't have information on)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which is contradicted by the fact that x is to the right of z, implying infx(x) > supx(z), which in turn means supx(x) > supx(z))

So, based on the formal definitions, if y is NE of z and x is N of y, then x cannot be N of z.

I've made a thinking error.  Let's try to create an example where we can check the relation between x and z, given that x is N of y and y is NE of z.

Imagine:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 2x2, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- y is at (3, 3) with dimensions 2x2, so its bounding box is (3, 3) to (5, 5).
- x is at (3, 6) with dimensions 2x2, so its bounding box is (3, 6) to (5, 8).

checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 3, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 2 <= 3 and 2 <= 3, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 5, infy(x) = 6, infx(y) = 3, infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 5, supx(y) = 5. So, 5 <= 6, 3 <= 3, and 5 <= 5, which means x is indeed N of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We have supy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 6, infx(z) = 0, infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 5, supx(z) = 2. So, 2 <= 6, 0 <= 3, but 5 <= 2 is false, so x is not N of z.
- For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We have supx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 3, supy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 6. So, 2 <= 3 and 2 <= 6, which means x is NE of z.

So, in this example, the relation between x and z is NE.

Let's try to bend the example to make it N:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 10x2, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (10, 2).
- y is at (3, 3) with dimensions 2x2, so its bounding box is (3, 3) to (5, 5).
- x is at (3, 6) with dimensions 2x2, so its bounding box is (3, 6) to (5, 8).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 10, infx(y) = 3, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 10 <= 3 is false, which means y is not NE of z.

Let me adjust the dimensions of z:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 2x2, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- y is at (3, 3) with dimensions 7x2, so its bounding box is (3, 3) to (10, 5).
- x is at (4, 6) with dimensions 2x2, so its bounding box is (4, 6) to (6, 8).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 3, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 2 <= 3 and 2 <= 3, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 5, infy(x) = 6, infx(y) = 3, infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 6, supx(y) = 10. So, 5 <= 6, 3 <= 4, and 6 <= 10, which means x is indeed N of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We have supy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 6, infx(z) = 0, infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 6, supx(z) = 2. So, 2 <= 6, 0 <= 4, but 6 <= 2 is false, so x is not N of z.
- For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We have supx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 4, supy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 6. So, 2 <= 4 and 2 <= 6, which means x is NE of z.

So, the relation between x and z is still NE.

Let me try again to find an example where x is N of z:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 10x2, so its bounding box is (0, 0) to (10, 2).
- y is at (8, 3) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (8, 3) to (9, 4).
- x is at (8, 5) with dimensions 1x1, so its bounding box is (8, 5) to (9, 6).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 10, infx(y) = 8, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 10 <= 8 is false, which means y is not NE of z.

Again, I'm having trouble creating an example where y is NE of z and x is N of y, but x is N of z. Let me think logically.

Given:
- x is N of y: This implies that x is directly above y and the horizontal projection of x is contained within the horizontal projection of y.
- y is NE of z: This implies that y is above and to the right of z.

If y is to the right of z, and x is directly above y, then x must also be to the right of z. This means x cannot be directly above z (which is what N would mean). The only valid relation would be NE, since x is both above and to the right of z.

Let's recap the formal definitions:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

Given:
- x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above z.
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z.

But for x N z, we also need supx(x) <= supx(z). However, from the fact that x is to the right of z (as derived above), we know that infx(x) > supx(z), which implies supx(x) > supx(z). This contradicts the requirement for x N z.

So, based on the formal definitions, if y is NE of z and x is N of y, then x cannot be N of z. The only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Actually, let me try once more, because I've been using the wrong definition. For a NE b, it's not just that a is above and to the right of b. It's that a is *completely* to the right and *completely* above b.

Let's try again with a different understanding:
- z has a bounding box of (0, 0) to (10, 2).
- y has a bounding box of (2, 3) to (8, 5).
- x has a bounding box of (3, 6) to (7, 8).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 10, infx(y) = 2, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 10 <= 2 is false, which means y is not NE of z.

Let me try again:
- z has a bounding box of (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- y has a bounding box of (3, 3) to (7, 5).
- x has a bounding box of (4, 6) to (6, 8).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 3, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 2 <= 3 and 2 <= 3, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 5, infy(x) = 6, infx(y) = 3, infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 6, supx(y) = 7. So, 5 <= 6, 3 <= 4, and 6 <= 7, which means x is indeed N of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We have supx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 4, supy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 6. So, 2 <= 4 and 2 <= 6, which means x is NE of z.

It seems like I'm consistently getting x NE z, which aligns with my logical reasoning. I'm therefore concluding that if x is N of y and y is NE of z, then the relation between x and z is NE.

Actually, let's try once more with a wide z:
- z has a bounding box of (0, 0) to (20, 2).
- y has a bounding box of (5, 3) to (10, 5).
- x has a bounding box of (6, 6) to (9, 8).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 20, infx(y) = 5, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 20 <= 5 is false, which means y is not NE of z.

The issue seems to be that for y to be NE of z, y has to be completely to the right of z, which means z cannot extend beyond the right edge of y. But this is contradicting the requirement for x to be N of z, which would mean that the horizontal projection of x (and hence y, since x is N of y) should be contained within the horizontal projection of z.

Wait let me try:

Imagine the bounding boxes (with (inf_x, inf_y) to (sup_x, sup_y)):
- z : (4, 1) to (10, 2)
- y : (5, 3) to (7, 4)
- x : (5, 5) to (6, 6)

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 10, infx(y) = 5, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 10 <= 5 is false. y is not NE of z.

I need to ensure y is NE of z:
- z : (2, 1) to (4, 2)
- y : (5, 3) to (7, 4)
- x : (6, 5) to (7, 6)

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 4 <= 5 and 2 <= 3, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 4, infy(x) = 5, infx(y) = 5, infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 7, supx(y) = 7. So, 4 <= 5, but 5 <= 6 is not <=, which means x is not N of y.

I'm making a mistake again. For infx(y) <= infx(x), it means the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of y. In the example, infx(y) = 5 and infx(x) = 6, so 5 <= 6, which is correct.

Let's try again:
- z : (2, 1) to (4, 2)
- y : (5, 3) to (7, 4)
- x : (6, 5) to (7, 6)

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 4 <= 5 and 2 <= 3, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 4, infy(x) = 5, infx(y) = 5, infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 7, supx(y) = 7. So, 4 <= 5, 5 <= 6, and 7 <= 7, which means x is indeed N of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(x) = 6, supy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 5. So, 4 <= 6 and 2 <= 5, which means x is NE of z.

I've tried various examples and have consistently found that if x is N of y and y is NE of z, then the relation between x and z is NE. This is because if y is NE of z, then y is both above and to the right of z. If x is N of y, then x is above y and its horizontal projection is contained within the horizontal projection of y. This means x is both above and to the right of z, resulting in a NE relation.

Now, I want to be extra sure and check if E is a possible relation.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not higher than the top of z)

Given:
- x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is NE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which satisfies the first condition for x E z.
- infy(z) and supy(x) don't have any direct relationship based on the given conditions, so we can't determine if the other conditions for x E z are satisfied.

Let's try to create an example:
- z has a bounding box of (2, 3) to (4, 8).
- y has a bounding box of (5, 5) to (7, 6).
- x has a bounding box of (6, 7) to (7, 8).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5, supy(z) = 8, infy(y) = 5. So, 4 <= 5, but 8 <= 5 is false, which means y is not NE of z.

Let me try again:
- z has a bounding box of (2, 1) to (4, 6).
- y has a bounding box of (5, 3) to (7, 4).
- x has a bounding box of (6, 5) to (7, 6).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5, supy(z) = 6, infy(y) = 3. So, 4 <= 5, but 6 <= 3 is false, which means y is not NE of z.

I'm having difficulty creating an example where y is NE of z. Let me be more careful:

For y NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

Let me try again:
- z has a bounding box of (2, 1) to (4, 2).
- y has a bounding box of (5, 3) to (7, 4).
- x has a bounding box of (6, 3) to (7, 4).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 4 <= 5 and 2 <= 3, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 4, infy(x) = 3, infx(y) = 5, infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 7, supx(y) = 7. So, 4 <= 3 is false, which means x is not N of y.

Let me try once more:
- z has a bounding box of (2, 1) to (4, 2).
- y has a bounding box of (5, 3) to (7, 4).
- x has a bounding box of (6, 5) to (7, 6).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 4 <= 5 and 2 <= 3, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 4, infy(x) = 5, infx(y) = 5, infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 7, supx(y) = 7. So, 4 <= 5, 5 <= 6, and 7 <= 7, which means x is indeed N of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- For x E z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(x) = 6, infy(z) = 1, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6, supy(z) = 2. So, 4 <= 6, 1 <= 5, but 6 <= 2 is false, which means x is not E of z.
- For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(x) = 6, supy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 5. So, 4 <= 6 and 2 <= 5, which means x is NE of z.

It seems like the relation between x and z is still NE. Let's think about this:

If y is NE of z, then y is both above and to the right of z.
If x is N of y, then x is above y and its horizontal projection is contained within the horizontal projection of y.

This means x is above y, which is above z, so x is above z.
Also, x is to the right of y, which is to the right of z, so x is to the right of z.

So, it makes sense that the relation between x and z is NE. But to be absolutely sure, let me check one more time if any other relation is possible.

For x NW z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

Given:
- x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is NE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z. This contradicts the requirement for x NW z, which requires x to be to the left of z.

So, x cannot be NW of z.

For x SE z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

Given:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the requirement for x SE z, which requires x to be below z.

So, x cannot be SE of z.

Similar reasoning can be applied to check other possible relations, and it turns out that the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

In conclusion, if x is N of y and y is NE of z, then the relation between x and z is NE.

No wait, so far only my analysis is right, I haven't been able to conduct a successful counterexample, and that's not enough.

Let me try once more to create an example for other relations:

Could x be N of z? My analyses says no, because if y is NE of z, then y is completely to the right of z. If x is N of y, then x is also completely to the right of z. So, x cannot be N of z.

Could x be E of z? 
For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not higher than the top of z)

Based on the given conditions, the first condition is satisfied. Let's try to find an example where the other two are also satisfied:
- z has a bounding box of (2, 4) to (4, 8).
- y has a bounding box of (5, 5) to (7, 6).
- x has a bounding box of (6, 5) to (7, 6).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5, supy(z) = 8, infy(y) = 5. So, 4 <= 5, but 8 <= 5 is false, which means y is not NE of z.

I'm struggling to create an example where y is NE of z and x is E of z. The issue seems to be that if y is NE of z, then y is above z. If x is N of y, then x is even further above y. This makes it impossible for x to be at the same vertical level as z, which is a requirement for x E z.

Let's modify the bounding boxes to make it easier to see:
- z has a bounding box of (2, 1) to (4, 2).
- y has a bounding box of (5, 3) to (7, 4).
- x has a bounding box of (6, 1) to (7, 2).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 4 <= 5 and 2 <= 3, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 4, infy(x) = 1, infx(y) = 5, infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 7, supx(y) = 7. So, 4 <= 1 is false, which means x is not N of y.

So we need x to be sufficiently far above.

- z has a bounding box of (1, 1) to (3, 2).
- y has a bounding box of (4, 3) to (6, 4).
- x has a bounding box of (5, 5) to (6, 6).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 3, infx(y) = 4, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 3 <= 4 and 2 <= 3, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 4, infy(x) = 5, infx(y) = 4, infx(x) = 5, supx(x) = 6, supx(y) = 6. So, 4 <= 5, 4 <= 5, and 6 <= 6, which means x is indeed N of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- For x E z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We have supx(z) = 3, infx(x) = 5, infy(z) = 1, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6, supy(z) = 2. So, 3 <= 5, 1 <= 5, but 6 <= 2 is false, which means x is not E of z.
- For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We have supx(z) = 3, infx(x) = 5, supy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 5. So, 3 <= 5 and 2 <= 5, which means x is NE of z.

So, it seems that x is NE of z.

Wait, lets try to create an example for SE:
- z has a bounding box of (1, 8) to (3, 9).
- y has a bounding box of (4, 6) to (6, 7).
- x has a bounding box of (5, 4) to (6, 5).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 3, infx(y) = 4, supy(z) = 9, infy(y) = 6. So, 3 <= 4, but 9 <= 6 is false, which means y is not NE of z.

Sorry I'm still messing up. y NE z implies z is below y, so we need to have z below. i.e.:
- z has a bounding box of (1, 1) to (3, 2).
- y has a bounding box of (4, 3) to (6, 4).
- x has a bounding box of (5, 1) to (6, 2).

Checking:
- For y NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). We have supx(z) = 3, infx(y) = 4, supy(z) = 2, infy(y) = 3. So, 3 <= 4 and 2 <= 3, which means y is indeed NE of z.
- For x N y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). We have supy(y) = 4, infy(x) = 1, infx(y) = 4, infx(x) = 5, supx(x) = 6, supx(y) = 6. So, 4 <= 1 is false, which means x is not N of y. Oh I keep messing up the "higher" constraint. x needs to be HIGHER in the coordinate system than y.

This is getting frustrating. Let me try a cleaner approach by systematically building the example:

Given the constraints, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of y)

From these, we derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)

Given that x is above and to the right of z, let's check all cardinal directions:
- N: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) (which we don't know from the constraints) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (which is contradicted by the fact that x is to the right of z).
- NE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), both of which are satisfied.
- E: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is satisfied), infy(z) <= infy(x) (which is satisfied), and supy(x) <= supy(z) (which is contradicted by the fact that x is above z).
- SE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is satisfied) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is contradicted by the fact that x is above z).
- S: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is contradicted by the fact that x is above z).
- SW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) (which is contradicted by the fact that x is to the right of z) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is contradicted by the fact that x is above z).
- W: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) (which is contradicted by the fact that x is to the right of z).
- NW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) (which is contradicted by the fact that x is to the right of z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is satisfied).
- B: Requires x to be inside z, which is contradicted by the fact that x is both above and to the right of z.

From this analysis, it's clear that the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NE.

So the answer to the question "If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is NE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints:
- x is N of region y
- y is NE of region z

I need to determine the possible relation between x and z.

Let's analyze what these constraints tell us:

For x N y:
- x is directly above y
- The horizontal projection of x is contained within y's horizontal projection
- Formally: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

For y NE z:
- y is completely to the right of z
- y is completely above z
- Formally: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these constraints, we can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the right of z

Since x is both above and to the right of z, the only possible relation is:

NE
