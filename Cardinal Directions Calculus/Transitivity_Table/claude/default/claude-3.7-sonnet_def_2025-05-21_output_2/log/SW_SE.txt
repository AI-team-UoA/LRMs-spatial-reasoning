PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this problem carefully.

We know:
1. Region x is SW of region y, i.e., x SW y
2. Region y is SE of region z, i.e., y SE z

We want to find possible relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions:
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z.

For the x-coordinates:
- From x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

These don't directly give us a relationship between x and z's x-coordinates.

For the y-coordinates:
- From x SW y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y SE z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, we get:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This means the y-coordinate of region x is below the y-coordinate of region z. But we don't have a clear relation for the x-coordinates.

Let's think about this geometrically. If we place the reference region z at the center:

1. y is in the SE region of z, which means y is to the right and below z.
2. x is in the SW region of y, which means x is to the left and below y.

Given these constraints, x could be in several positions relative to z:

- x could be SW of z if x is both to the left and below z.
- x could be S of z if x is directly below z (same x-range).
- x could be SE of z if x is to the right and below z, but this requires x to be to the right of z even though it's to the left of y. This is possible if z is far enough to the left.
- x could be W of z if x is directly to the left of z (same y-range).
- x could be B of z if x falls inside the bounding box of z.
- x could be E of z if x is directly to the right of z (same y-range).

Actually, let me take a step back and be more careful here. Let's consider the constraints more systematically.

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Let's combine these:
1. From the first point of each: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   This doesn't directly give us a relation between x and z's x-coordinates.

2. From the second point of each: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   This gives us: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

So, we can say for sure that region x is below region z based on the y-coordinates. But for the x-coordinates, we don't have a clear relationship.

Let me think about what the possible cardinal directions could be if we know x is below z but the x-coordinates could vary:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the left of z. Given that we also know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is below z. So, x SW z is possible.

2. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x's x-range is within z's x-range. Given that we also know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is directly below z. So, x S z is possible.

3. If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is to the right of z. Given that we also know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is below and to the right of z. So, x SE z is possible.

4. The relations B, W, NW, N, NE, E can't hold because they would contradict the fact that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Let me check this reasoning again. Actually, I realize I've made an error. If x SW y and y SE z, the x-coordinates are:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)

From these, we can't directly deduce a relationship between x and z in terms of the x-coordinates.

Actually, let me try to place the regions on the coordinate plane. If:
- Region z is at position (0,0).
- Region y is at position (2,-2) [SE of z]
- Region x is at position (-1, -3) [SW of y]

In this case, x would be SW of z.

But if:
- Region z is at position (0,0).
- Region y is at position (5,-2) [SE of z]
- Region x is at position (2, -4) [SW of y]

In this case, x would be S of z.

And if:
- Region z is at position (0,0).
- Region y is at position (8,-2) [SE of z]
- Region x is at position (5, -4) [SW of y]

In this case, x would be SE of z.

So, the possible relations are: SW, S, and SE.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my visualization.

If:
- Region z is at position (0,0) with dimensions 1x1 (spanning from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5)).
- Region y is at position (2,-2) with dimensions 1x1 (spanning from (1.5, -2.5) to (2.5, -1.5)).

Then for y to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Checking:
- supx(z) = 0.5 ≤ infx(y) = 1.5 ✓
- supy(y) = -1.5 ≤ infy(z) = -0.5 ✓

Now, if region x is at position (-1, -3) with dimensions 1x1 (spanning from (-1.5, -3.5) to (-0.5, -2.5)).

For x to be SW of y, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

Checking:
- supx(x) = -0.5 ≤ infx(y) = 1.5 ✓
- supy(x) = -2.5 ≤ infy(y) = -2.5 ✓

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
- supx(x) = -0.5 ≤ infx(z) = -0.5, but we need a strict inequality for SW or W.
- supy(x) = -2.5 which is less than infy(z) = -0.5.

Let me adjust the position of x a bit:

If region x is at position (-1.5, -3) (spanning from (-2, -3.5) to (-1, -2.5)):

For x to be SW of y:
- supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(y) = 1.5 ✓
- supy(x) = -2.5 ≤ infy(y) = -2.5 ✓

Now, the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(z) = -0.5, but this isn't a strict inequality.

Let me adjust the position of x once more:

If region x is at position (-2, -3) (spanning from (-2.5, -3.5) to (-1.5, -2.5)):

For x to be SW of y:
- supx(x) = -1.5 ≤ infx(y) = 1.5 ✓
- supy(x) = -2.5 ≤ infy(y) = -2.5 ✓

Now, the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = -1.5 < infx(z) = -0.5 ✓
- supy(x) = -2.5 < infy(z) = -0.5 ✓

So, x is SW of z.

Let me try different positions for x to see if it can be S or SE of z.

If region x is at position (0, -3) (spanning from (-0.5, -3.5) to (0.5, -2.5)):

For x to be SW of y:
- supx(x) = 0.5 ≤ infx(y) = 1.5 ✓
- supy(x) = -2.5 ≤ infy(y) = -2.5 ✓

Now, the relation between x and z:
- infx(z) = -0.5, supx(z) = 0.5
- infx(x) = -0.5, supx(x) = 0.5
- So, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (they're the same in this case)
- supy(x) = -2.5 < infy(z) = -0.5 ✓

This means x is S of z.

And if region x is at position (2, -3) (spanning from (1.5, -3.5) to (2.5, -2.5)):

For x to be SW of y:
- supx(x) = 2.5 > infx(y) = 1.5 ❌

Hmm, this doesn't work. Let me backtrack a bit. We need x to be SW of y and we want to check if x can be SE of z. Let's try another approach.

The constraint from x SW y is:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

The constraint from y SE z is:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

We already know from the combined constraints:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This satisfies the second part for x to be SE of z.

For the first part:
- From x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

So, we have: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y)

It's not immediately clear if supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which would be required for x to be SE of z.

Let's try to construct a specific example to see if it's possible:

Take:
- Region z spanning from (-1, 0) to (0, 1). So, infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 0, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.
- Region y spanning from (1, -2) to (2, -1). So, infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 2, infy(y) = -2, supy(y) = -1.

For y to be SE of z:
- supx(z) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 ✓
- supy(y) = -1 < infy(z) = 0 ✓

Now, for x to be SW of y and SE of z, x needs to be to the left of y and to the right of z.

Let's try:
- Region x spanning from (0.5, -3) to (0.8, -2.5). So, infx(x) = 0.5, supx(x) = 0.8, infy(x) = -3, supy(x) = -2.5.

For x to be SW of y:
- supx(x) = 0.8 < infx(y) = 1 ✓
- supy(x) = -2.5 < infy(y) = -2 ✓

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) = 0 < infx(x) = 0.5 ✓
- supy(x) = -2.5 < infy(z) = 0 ✓

So, it's indeed possible for x to be SE of z.

The constraints from x SW y and y SE z do allow for the possibility of x being SW, S, or SE of z.

Let's check each of the possible cardinal directions to see which ones are consistent with the given constraints:

1. B: For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But we've already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

2. S: For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from the combined constraints. The other conditions can be satisfied as shown in one of the examples above. So, x can be S of z.

3. SW: For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from the combined constraints. The condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z) can be satisfied as shown above. So, x can be SW of z.

4. W: For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). From the combined constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is entirely below z, which contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) required for W. So, x cannot be W of z.

5. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). From the combined constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for NW. So, x cannot be NW of z.

6. N: For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). From the combined constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for N. So, x cannot be N of z.

7. NE: For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). From the combined constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for NE. So, x cannot be NE of z.

8. E: For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). From the combined constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) required for E. So, x cannot be E of z.

9. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from the combined constraints. The condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) can be satisfied as shown in the example above. So, x can be SE of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and SE.

Actually, let me recheck this. I think I didn't correctly account for the possibility that regions x and y might overlap if we only require x to be in the SW direction of y (and not strictly SW). 

But actually the definitions in the problem statement are clear. For a region x to be SW of region y, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). There's no overlap in the x or y coordinates.

Similarly, for a region y to be SE of region z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). Again, there's no overlap.

Given these definitions, I believe my analysis is correct. The possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and SE.

Actually, let's double-check the plausibility of x being S of z, given that x is SW of y and y is SE of z.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This satisfies the first condition for x to be S of z.

For the second and third conditions, we need to determine if it's possible for infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

From x SW y and y SE z, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)

This doesn't give us a direct relation between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z). 

However, we can construct a specific example:

Let's place the regions:
- Region z from (0, 0) to (1, 1). So, infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.
- Region y from (2, -2) to (3, -1). So, infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = -2, supy(y) = -1.

For y to be SE of z:
- supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 ✓
- supy(y) = -1 < infy(z) = 0 ✓

Now, for x to be S of z, it should be directly below z. Let's try:
- Region x from (0.25, -3) to (0.75, -2.5). So, infx(x) = 0.25, supx(x) = 0.75, infy(x) = -3, supy(x) = -2.5.

For x to be SW of y:
- supx(x) = 0.75 < infx(y) = 2 ✓
- supy(x) = -2.5 < infy(y) = -2 ✓

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) = -2.5 < infy(z) = 0 ✓
- infx(z) = 0 < infx(x) = 0.25 ✓
- supx(x) = 0.75 < supx(z) = 1 ✓

So, it's indeed possible for x to be S of z.

Hmm wait. That doesn't look right. For x to be S of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but also supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But the first two conditions mean that x's x-range is contained within z's x-range, so they're aligned vertically.

Let me re-check the definition for S:

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

So for x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)

Yes, these are exactly the conditions I was checking. And it's possible for x to be S of z, as shown in the example. So, S is a possible relation between x and z.

Let me finalize the possible relations between x and z:

The possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is SW of y and y is SE of z, are: SW, S, and SE.

Actually, I got confused on one thing. Looking back at the definition, this is how "S" is defined:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

This means a is to the south of b, or directly below b.

Now, for x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The second and third conditions ensure that x's x-range is within z's x-range, meaning x is directly below z.

Let's use the example I had:
- Region z from (0, 0) to (1, 1). So, infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1.
- Region x from (0.25, -3) to (0.75, -2.5). So, infx(x) = 0.25, supx(x) = 0.75.

Checking the conditions:
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 0.25 ✓
- supx(x) = 0.75 <= supx(z) = 1 ✓

These are satisfied, so x can be S of z.

I think the confusion came from not carefully reading the definition of the relationship. But by the example I've provided, it's clear that x can be S of z, even with the constraints that x is SW of y and y is SE of z.

OK, let's check my work another time. In the problem statement, it says:
1. Region x is SW of region y, i.e., x SW y
2. Region y is SE of region z, i.e., y SE z

From the definition of SW:
- x SW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

From the definition of SE:
- y SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Let's see what we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can derive: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

So, x is below z. But the x-coordinate relationship is not clear.

Let's check when x SW z:
For x SW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from the derived relationship.
However, we can't directly infer whether supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But this can be true for some configurations.

Let's check when x S z:
For x S z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from the derived relationship.
The other conditions can also be satisfied for certain configurations.

Let's check when x SE z:
For x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from the derived relationship.
The condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) can also be true for certain configurations, as I showed in the examples.

For the remaining relationships:
- B, W, NW, N, NE, E all require infy(z) ≤ infy(x) or supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts our derived relationship supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, these relationships are not possible.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and SE.

I hope this clarifies my analysis.

Wait, let me double-check the definition of B (Bounding box):

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

This means a is contained within the bounding box of b.

For x to be B of z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

But from our derived relationship supy(x) <= infy(z), we know that x is below z. This contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

Let's revisit the definitions:

x SW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
x S z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the derived relationship supy(x) <= infy(z), we can immediately rule out B, W, NW, N, NE, and E.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and SE.

OK. So after checking all possibilites and double-checking my analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and SE.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

SW, S, SE

I arrived at these by analyzing what we know:
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can deduce that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x must be below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).

This immediately rules out B, W, NW, N, NE, E as they all require x to at least partially align with z vertically.

For the x-coordinates, we cannot directly determine a relationship, allowing for three possibilities:
- SW: x is to the left and below z
- S: x is directly below z
- SE: x is to the right and below z
