PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step-by-step using the definitions provided.

We know that:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is B of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definition of NE (Northeast) and B (Bounding box):

- x NE y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  This means x is entirely in the northeast quadrant of y.

- y B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
  This means y is entirely inside the bounding box of z.

Now, let's analyze these constraints to determine the possible positions of x relative to z:

From x NE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends westward at least as far as y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends eastward at least as far as y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends southward at least as far as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends northward at least as far as y)

Now, let's combine these to find constraints on x relative to z:

We know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

This means infx(x) could be greater than or equal to supx(z), or it could be in between supx(y) and supx(z).

Similarly for the y-coordinates:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

This means infy(x) could be greater than or equal to supy(z), or it could be in between supy(y) and supy(z).

Let's analyze the possible cases:

Case 1: If infx(x) >= supx(z) and infy(x) >= supy(z), then x is entirely to the northeast of z, so x NE z.

Case 2: If infx(x) >= supx(z) but infy(x) < supy(z), then x could be in the east (E) or southeast (SE) of z, depending on the exact position.

Case 3: If infx(x) < supx(z) but infy(x) >= supy(z), then x could be in the north (N) or northeast (NE) of z, depending on the exact position.

Case 4: If infx(x) < supx(z) and infy(x) < supy(z), then x could be inside (B) or any of the other directions relative to z, depending on the exact position.

Let me make a more systematic analysis to ensure I'm not missing anything:

Since y is B of z, the bounding box of y is contained within the bounding box of z. Since x is NE of y, x is entirely in the northeast quadrant outside of y. 

Let's consider the extreme cases:
1. If y occupies the entire bounding box of z (i.e., y = z), then x would be NE of z as well.
2. If y is just a small region in the southwest corner of z, then x could be inside (B) of z.

But we need to consider all possible positions of x relative to z. Let's check each potential direction:

1. N (North): If x is directly north of z, it means supx(z) <= infx(x) is false (since x can overlap with z in the x-direction) but supy(z) <= infy(x) is true. This is possible if y is positioned in such a way that x is in the north of z.

2. NE (Northeast): As we saw, if x is entirely to the northeast of z, it means both supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) are true. This is definitely possible.

3. E (East): If x is directly east of z, it means supx(z) <= infx(x) is true but supy(z) <= infy(x) is false (since x can overlap with z in the y-direction). This is possible depending on the position of y.

4. SE (Southeast): For x to be in the southeast of z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But from our constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x), and from y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y). This implies infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement for SE. So, x cannot be SE of z.

Wait, I need to be more careful with the implications. Let's re-examine.

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Hmm, I think I made an error in my reasoning. Let me redo:

- From x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

But these don't necessarily imply supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x might or might not be east of z.

Similarly, for the y-coordinate:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

These don't provide a clear relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). 

OK, let me approach this differently. I'll draw out some possible configurations to see what relationships are possible:

1. Imagine z as a large bounding box, and y as a small region in the south-west of z. Then, x being NE of y could still be inside (B) of z.

2. Now, if y is a bit larger and covers most of the southern part of z, then x being NE of y would be in the N of z.

3. If y is a bit larger and covers most of the western part of z, then x being NE of y would be in the E of z.

4. If y is a very large region and nearly covers the entire z, then x being NE of y would be in the NE of z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: B, N, E, and NE.

Are there any other possibilities I'm missing?

Let's also consider:

5. If y covers the southern and eastern parts of z, then x being NE of y could be in the NE of z.

6. If y covers the northern and western parts of z, then x being NE of y could be in the E of z or the NE of z.

It seems I'm starting to repeat myself. Let me systematically check each of the 9 possible relations to see if they're possible:

1. B (Bounding box): If y is a small region in the southwest of z, and x is NE of y but still inside z, then x B z. Possible.

2. N (North): If y covers most of the southern part of z, and x is NE of y, then x could be north of z. Possible.

3. NE (Northeast): If y is a large region and nearly covers z, then x being NE of y would also be NE of z. Possible.

4. E (East): If y covers most of the western part of z, and x is NE of y, then x could be east of z. Possible.

5. SE (Southeast): For x to be SE of z, it would need to be both east and south of z. But being NE of y implies that x is north of y. If y is inside z (as y B z suggests), then x being north of y doesn't allow it to be south of z. So, x cannot be SE of z. Not possible.

6. S (South): Similar to SE, if x is NE of y, it's north of y. If y is inside z, then x cannot be south of z. Not possible.

7. SW (Southwest): If x is NE of y, it's both north and east of y. If y is inside z, then x cannot be both south and west of z. Not possible.

8. W (West): If x is NE of y, it's east of y. If y is inside z, then x being east of y makes it challenging for x to be west of z. It would require y to be in the eastern part of z, and x to be just slightly east of y but still west of the eastern boundary of z. But I'm not sure if this specific configuration is possible given the constraints. Let me think about it more.

Oh, I realize I've been simplifying the understanding of the B relation. The B relation doesn't strictly mean "inside"; it means "inside the bounding box". So, y B z means the bounding box of y is inside the bounding box of z, but y could still touch the boundary of z.

But even with this understanding, if y touches the eastern boundary of z, then x being east of y would make it east of z as well, not west. So, I still think x cannot be W of z. Not possible.

9. NW (Northwest): For x to be NW of z, it would need to be both north and west of z. But being NE of y implies that x is east of y. If y is inside z, then x being east of y makes it challenging for x to be west of z. Similar to the W case, I don't think this is possible. Not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, NE, and E.

Wait let me check NW again. If y is large and covers the northern and eastern parts of z, with its southwestern corner at the center of z, and if x is just slightly northeast of y, it could potentially be northwest of z.

Let me re-evaluate this:

If y is B of z, then the bounding box of y is inside the bounding box of z. This means that the northernmost point of y is south of or on the northernmost point of z, and the easternmost point of y is west of or on the easternmost point of z.

If x is NE of y, then x is entirely in the northeast quadrant of y. This means that the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y, and the southernmost point of x is north of or on the northernmost point of y.

Now, for x to be NW of z, the easternmost point of x should be west of the westernmost point of z, and the southernmost point of x should be north of the northernmost point of z.

But if y is B of z, the easternmost point of y is west of or on the easternmost point of z. And if x is NE of y, the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y. This means that the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y, which is west of or on the easternmost point of z. So, it's not guaranteed that the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z. Thus, x might not be NW of z.

Hmm, I seem to be making an error in my reasoning. Let me re-read the definitions more carefully:

For a NW b, we need supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a). This means that the easternmost point of 'a' is west of the westernmost point of 'b', and the southernmost point of 'a' is north of the northernmost point of 'b'.

Now, let's see:

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

We know supy(y) <= infy(x) from x NE y, and supy(y) <= supy(z) from y B z. But this doesn't conclusively give us supy(z) <= infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) > infy(x).

Similarly, for the x-coordinate, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) from x NE y, and infx(z) <= infx(y) from y B z. These don't provide a clear relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

So, I believe that x could potentially be NW of z, but it's not guaranteed based on the given constraints.

Let me re-evaluate by checking the "simple constraints":
With x NE y, we have x's western boundary is east of y's eastern boundary
With y B z, we have y's eastern boundary is west of z's eastern boundary

So transitively, we can't say if x's western boundary is east or west of z's western boundary.

Let me draw out a simple example to see if x can be NW of z:

Let's say y is positioned such that it's inside z (y B z) and is touching the northeastern boundary of z. Now, if x is to the NE of y, it would be outside of z and could be in the NW quadrant of z. But for this to happen, y needs to be touching the easternmost boundary of z, and x needs to be just slightly east of y but still west of the westernmost point of z. Is this possible?

Let's say z's bounding box is at coordinates (0,0) to (10,10). If y's bounding box is at (8,8) to (10,10) (making it touch the northeast corner of z), then x, being NE of y, would have its bounding box starting at, say, (10,10). This would make x to the NE of z, not NW.

Let me see if I can tweak this... maybe I need to position y differently.

If y's bounding box is at (0,8) to (2,10) (making it touch the northwest corner of z), then x, being NE of y, would have its bounding box starting at, say, (2,10). This could potentially make x to the N of z, but not NW.

I'm having trouble constructing an example where x is NW of z, given the constraints. Let me think about this differently.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of z)

From our given constraints:
- From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of y).
- From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends westward at least as far as y), supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends eastward at least as far as y), infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends southward at least as far as y), and supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends northward at least as far as y).

Combining these, can we derive supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)?

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). But from y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y). These imply infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which doesn't give us the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) that we need for x to be NW of z.

Similarly, from x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x). And from y B z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). But these don't give us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) that we need.

So, based on the given constraints alone, it's not guaranteed that x is NW of z. I don't believe x can be NW of z.

Wait, no let me re-read the definitions more carefully:

For a NW b, we need that "a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)"

This means that the easternmost point of 'a' is west of the westernmost point of 'b', and the southernmost point of 'a' is north of the northernmost point of 'b'.

Let's see:

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

But from x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(x) >= supx(y).
And from y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), which means infx(z) <= infx(y).

We can't derive supx(x) <= infx(z) from these, so x might not be NW of z.

Wait, I think I'm making an error. If x is NE of y, then x is entirely in the NE quadrant of y. So, for any point in x, both its x and y coordinates are greater than the corresponding coordinates of any point in y. This means the westernmost point of x is east of the easternmost point of y. So, supx(y) <= infx(x).

But we also know from the B relation that y's bounding box is inside z's bounding box. So, the easternmost point of y is west of or on the easternmost point of z. That means supx(y) <= supx(z).

So, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't guarantee any specific relation between infx(x) and supx(z). x can be east of z, or it can overlap with z in the x-direction. But to be NW of z, the easternmost point of x needs to be west of the westernmost point of z. Given the constraints, we can't guarantee that. So, x might not be NW of z.

But I need to be careful, in case I'm making an error. Let me try to construct a specific example where x is NW of z, given the constraints.

Let's use the definitions directly, using coordinates:
- If x NE y, then: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- If y B z, then: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)
- For x to be NW of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

Let's assign coordinates and check:
- Let's say z's bounding box is at (0,0) to (10,10).
- Given y B z, let's say y's bounding box is at (2,2) to (8,8). This satisfies: 0 <= 2, 8 <= 10, 0 <= 2, and 8 <= 10.
- Given x NE y, let's say x's bounding box is at (8,8) to (10,10). This satisfies: 8 <= 8 and 8 <= 8.
- Now, to check if x is NW of z, we need: 10 <= 0 and 10 <= 8. But 10 <= 0 is not true, so x is not NW of z in this example.

Let me try another set of coordinates:
- Let's say z's bounding box is at (0,0) to (10,10).
- Given y B z, let's say y's bounding box is at (0,8) to (2,10). This satisfies: 0 <= 0, 2 <= 10, 0 <= 8, and 10 <= 10.
- Given x NE y, let's say x's bounding box is at (2,10) to (4,12). This satisfies: 2 <= 2 and 10 <= 10.
- Now, to check if x is NW of z, we need: 4 <= 0 and 10 <= 10. But 4 <= 0 is not true, so x is not NW of z in this example.

I'm having difficulty constructing an example where x is NW of z, given the constraints, I now think I was wrong twice. Let me go back to just reasoning in general:

If x is NE of y, then the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y. And if y is B of z, then the easternmost point of y is west of or on the easternmost point of z. This means the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y, which is west of or on the easternmost point of z. 

For x to be NW of z, the easternmost point of x should be west of the westernmost point of z. Given that the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y, and the easternmost point of y is west of or on the easternmost point of z, the easternmost point of x can't be west of the westernmost point of z. Hence, x can't be NW of z.

This feels solid, let me just double-check again with the definitions.

OK so x NE y means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
And y B z means infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). This means, from a coordinate line perspective, infx(x) is more to the right compared to supx(y).

And from y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y). This means, from a coordinate line perspective, infx(y) is more to the right compared to infx(z).

Now, to determine if x is NW of z, we need to check if supx(x) <= infx(z). But given that supx(x) is the rightmost point of x, and infx(x) is the leftmost point of x, we have infx(x) <= supx(x).

Combining this with what we found earlier: supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). But we can't use this to relate supx(x) and infx(z) directly.

So, based on the given constraints alone, we can't guarantee that x is NW of z.

Let me use the transitive property to gain more insights. From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y). From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). If supx(y) = infx(x) holds, then we'd also have infx(z) <= supx(y) = infx(x) <= supx(x), which doesn't determine the relationship between infx(z) and supx(x).

But what it does tell us is that we don't have a chain of inequalities from supx(x) to infx(z). With the given constraints, we can't determine if supx(x) <= infx(z). Similarly, for the y-coordinate, we can't determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) without additional information.

Hence, it's not conclusive that x is NW of z. But let me now explicitly check whether it can still happen in some cases.

Let me try another thought experiment. Imagine a scenario where I've is a smal region in the westmost portion of z. Then within that quadrant, x could be northeast of y, but still West of Z. 

Actually let's set up a specific numerical example.

Imagine:
- z's bounding box is at (0,0) to (10,10)
- y's bounding box is at (0,0) to (1,1) (y is in the bottom-left corner of z)
- x's bounding box is at (1,1) to (2,2) (x is NE of y)

Now, to check if x is NW of z, we need: 2 <= 0 (which is not true). So x is not NW of z in this example.

Let's try a slightly different configuration:
- z's bounding box is at (0,0) to (10,10)
- y's bounding box is at (1,1) to (3,3) (y is inside z and not at the boundary)
- x's bounding box is at (3,3) to (4,4) (x is NE of y and inside z)

To check if x is NW of z, we need: 4 <= 0 (which is not true). So x is not NW of z in this example either.

Let's imagine more edge cases. Suppose z is hourglass shaped so it doesn't cover its entire bounding box. But that's outside our constraints since we're talking exclusively about the bounding boxes of regions, not their shapes.

OK, I'll now re-apply our reasoning systematically and reconsider what are possible directions.

From the given:
- x NE y means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y B z means infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Starting with x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) means the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y.
- supy(y) <= infy(x) means the southernmost point of x is north of or on the northernmost point of y.

Now, let's check each of the directions:

1. B (Bounding box):
   For x B z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   Given:
   - From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
   - From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
   
   From supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can't conclusively determine the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x). From the inequalities, infx(z) could be less than or greater than infx(x). Similarly, for the other conditions.
   
   Thus, x B z is possible.

2. N (North):
   For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   
   From y B z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x). Thus, we can derive supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x). But this doesn't conclusively determine the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).
   
   From the inequalities, it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x). Similarly, for the x-coordinate constraints, they can be satisfied in certain configurations.
   
   Thus, x N z is possible.

3. NE (Northeast):
   For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   From y B z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z) and supy(y) <= supy(z). From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x). From these, we can derive supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x). But this doesn't conclusively determine the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).
   
   From the inequalities, it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x). Similarly, for the y-coordinate.
   
   Thus, x NE z is possible.

4. E (East):
   For x E z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   Using similar reasoning as above, it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x). And for the y-coordinate constraints, they can be satisfied in certain configurations.
   
   Thus, x E z is possible.

5. SE (Southeast):
   For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   But from x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x), which means the southernmost point of x is north of or on the northernmost point of y. And from y B z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y), which means the northernmost point of y is north of or on the northernmost point of z. This implies infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(z), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   Thus, x SE z is not possible.

6. S (South):
   For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   
   Using similar reasoning as for SE, we find that infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(z), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   Thus, x S z is not possible.

7. SW (Southwest):
   For x SW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   But from x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(x) >= supx(y). And from y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), which means infx(z) <= infx(y). Since our inequalities are bounds, it's possible for values to be equal, let's consider that. What if supx(y) = infx(x) and infx(y) = infx(z)? Then, infx(x) = supx(y) = infx(y) = infx(z). But for x SW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). Since infx(x) <= supx(x) (the leftmost point of x is always to the left of the rightmost point of x), and if infx(x) = infx(z), then it's possible that supx(x) > infx(z), contradicting the requirement.
   
   And as seen for SE and S, the y-coordinate requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) also leads to a contradiction.
   
   Thus, x SW z is not possible.

8. W (West):
   For x W z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   But from x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(x) >= supx(y). And from y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), which means infx(z) <= infx(y). The left boundary of x (infx(x)) is to the right of the right boundary of y (supx(y)). And the left boundary of z (infx(z)) is to the left of the left boundary of y (infx(y)). This means the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of z. For x to be west of z, the right boundary of x should be to the left of the left boundary of z, which contradicts our findings.
   
   Thus, x W z is not possible.

9. NW (Northwest):
   For x NW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   Using similar reasoning as for W, we find that the right boundary of x (supx(x)) is not guaranteed to be to the left of the left boundary of z (infx(z)).
   
   Thus, x NW z is not guaranteed, and I believe it's not possible given the constraints.

Let me double-check the NW case again to convince myself. If x is NE of y, then the westernmost point of x (infx(x)) is east of or on the easternmost point of y (supx(y)). If y is B of z, then the easternmost point of y (supx(y)) is west of or on the easternmost point of z (supx(z)). 

For x to be NW of z, the easternmost point of x (supx(x)) should be west of the westernmost point of z (infx(z)). 

Given that infx(x) >= supx(y) (from x NE y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z), we have infx(x) >= supx(y) >= infx(y) >= infx(z). This implies infx(x) >= infx(z), which means the westernmost point of x is east of or on the westernmost point of z. Since the easternmost point of x (supx(x)) is always east of its westernmost point (infx(x)), we have supx(x) >= infx(x) >= infx(z). This contradicts the requirement for NW, which is supx(x) <= infx(z).

So, x NW z is not possible.

So in summary the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, NE, and E.

Ah, I think I might have made a mistake in my reasoning for the NW case. Let's see: I said "the easternmost point of y (supx(y)) is west of or on the easternmost point of z (supx(z))." But then I wrote "supx(y) >= infx(y) >= infx(z)". That's a mistake: we know from y B z that supx(y) <= supx(z), not that supx(y) >= infx(y). 

Let's redo. 

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x). From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means the westernmost point of x (infx(x)) is east of or on the easternmost point of y (supx(y)). Since the leftmost point of any object is always to the left of its rightmost point, we have infx(x) <= supx(x). From these, we can derive supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).

From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), which means the westernmost point of y (infx(y)) is east of or on the westernmost point of z (infx(z)). But this doesn't give us a direct constraint on supx(y) and infx(z). The easternmost point of y (supx(y)) is inside the bounding box of z, so it's possible for supx(y) to be to the right of infx(z). But it's also possible for supx(y) to be to the left of infx(z).

Given the uncertainties, I can't derive a conclusive relation between supx(x) and infx(z) from the given constraints.

Hmm, my mistake.

from y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), meaning the leftmost part of z is to the left of the leftmost part of y. We also have supx(y) <= supx(z), meaning the rightmost part of y is to the left of the rightmost part of z. But these inequalities don't necessarily tell us about the relationship between the rightmost part of y (supx(y)) and the leftmost part of z (infx(z)). It's entirely possible for the rightmost part of y to be to the left of the leftmost part of z. It's also possible for the rightmost part of y to be to the right of the leftmost part of z.

If supx(y) <= infx(z), then the rightmost part of y is to the left of the leftmost part of z. From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), meaning the leftmost part of x is to the right of the rightmost part of y. So, infx(x) >= supx(y). And if supx(y) <= infx(z), then infx(x) >= infx(z). This means the leftmost part of x is to the right of the leftmost part of z, which contradicts the requirement for NW, which is supx(x) <= infx(z).

But if supx(y) > infx(z), then the rightmost part of y is to the right of the leftmost part of z. In this case, we can't conclusively determine the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). It's possible for infx(x) to be to the left, and it's also at least a priori possible for it to be to the right of infx(z).

But since we're asking about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) for the NW direction, let's see if we can constrain that. We have supx(y) <= infx(x) from x NE y. And we know infx(x) <= supx(x) generally. So, supx(y) <= supx(x). But, as we've seen, the relationship between supx(y) and infx(z) is uncertain from the given constraints. So, the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) is also uncertain.

So is x NW z possible? I can't seem to exclude it, but I'm having trouble imagining a scenario where it's true.

OK, I know I'm overthinking this. I think I should try a concrete example:

- Let's say z's bounding box is at (0,0) to (10,10).
- Given y B z, let's say y's bounding box is at (1,5) to (5,9). This satisfies: 0 <= 1, 5 <= 10, 0 <= 5, and 9 <= 10.
- Given x NE y, let's say x's bounding box is at (5,9) to (9,13). This satisfies: 5 <= 5 and 9 <= 9.

Now, to check if x is NW of z, we need: 9 <= 0 (which is not true) and 10 <= 9 (which is also not true). So x is not NW of z in this example.

OK, I think we should check if x can be in any intermediate directions (like NBLAH), otherwise directions like B and N are mutually exclusive.

Actually, a region in this context is a set of points. Two regions can partially overlap or one can be a subset of another. So, it's possible for x to be B (bounding box) of z in some parts and N (North) of z in other parts.

But the question asked for the "possible relations between region x and region z." I assume this means the relations where the entirety of x is in a certain direction from z, not just parts of it.

So, as our analysis has shown, the possible relations are: B, N, NE, and E.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking the problem and confusing myself. Let me re-read the problem statement one more time.

OK, I think I've been overthinking the problem and confusing myself. Let me re-read the problem statement one more time.

OK let me take a step back. We defined the cardinal direction in terms of the bounding boxes of the regions. I think I've been getting confused about the shapes of the regions themselves.

Let's simplify:
- x NE y means that the bounding box of x is entirely in the northeast quadrant of the bounding box of y. Specifically, supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y B z means that the bounding box of y is entirely inside the bounding box of z. Specifically, infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Now, let's reason about the possible relations between x and z.

1. B (Bounding box): If y is a small region inside z, and x is NE of y but still inside z, then x can be inside the bounding box of z. So, x B z is possible.

2. N (North): If y is a region in the southern part of z, and x is NE of y, then x can be north of z. So, x N z is possible.

3. NE (Northeast): If y is a region in the southwestern corner of z, and x is NE of y but outside z, then x can be in the northeast of z. So, x NE z is possible.

4. E (East): If y is a region in the western part of z, and x is NE of y but outside z, then x can be east of z. So, x E z is possible.

5. SE (Southeast): If x is NE of y, then the southernmost point of x is north of or on the northernmost point of y. If y is inside z, then the northernmost point of y is inside z. This means the southernmost point of x can't be south of z, so x can't be in the southeast of z. So, x SE z is not possible.

6. S (South): Using similar reasoning as for SE, the southernmost point of x can't be south of z, so x can't be south of z. So, x S z is not possible.

7. SW (Southwest): If x is NE of y, then the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y. If y is inside z, then the easternmost point of y is inside z. This means the westernmost point of x can't be west of z, so x can't be in the southwest of z. So, x SW z is not possible.

8. W (West): Using similar reasoning as for SW, the westernmost point of x can't be west of z, so x can't be west of z. So, x W z is not possible.

9. NW (Northwest): For x to be NW of z, its bounding box needs to be entirely in the northwest quadrant of the bounding box of z. If x is NE of y, then its bounding box is entirely in the northeast quadrant of the bounding box of y. And if y is inside z, then the northeast quadrant of y is inside the northeast quadrant of z. This means the bounding box of x can't be entirely in the northwest quadrant of the bounding box of z, so x NW z is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, NE, and E.

Actually I think I'm overthinking the problem and getting very confused. Let's be more direct:

From x NE y, we know that x is entirely in the northeast quadrant of y. From y B z, we know that y is entirely within the bounding box of z.

Let's analyze the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. If y is close to the northeastern boundary of z, then x, being NE of y, can be completely outside z in the northeast direction. So, x NE z is possible.

2. If y is close to the northern boundary of z but not the eastern boundary, then x, being NE of y, can be completely outside z in the north direction. So, x N z is possible.

3. If y is close to the eastern boundary of z but not the northern boundary, then x, being NE of y, can be completely outside z in the east direction. So, x E z is possible.

4. If y is away from the northern and eastern boundaries of z, then x, being NE of y, can still be inside z. So, x B z is possible.

Now, let's check if x can be in other directions relative to z:

5. If x is NE of y, then the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y. And if y is inside z, then the easternmost point of y is inside z. This means the westernmost point of x can't be west of z. So, x can't be SW, W, or NW of z.

6. If x is NE of y, then the southernmost point of x is north of or on the northernmost point of y. And if y is inside z, then the northernmost point of y is inside z. This means the southernmost point of x can't be south of z. So, x can't be SE or S of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, NE, and E.

Let me make sure that these are congruous with the algebraic inequalities.

x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's go through each direction:

B (Bounding box): 
x B z means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
From the given constraints, I can't directly derive these, but I can't exclude them either. So, x B z is possible.

N (North):
x N z means supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
From the given constraints, I can't directly derive these, but I can't exclude them either. So, x N z is possible.

NE (Northeast):
x NE z means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
From the given constraints, I can't directly derive these, but I can't exclude them either. So, x NE z is possible.

E (East):
x E z means supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
From the given constraints, I can't directly derive these, but I can't exclude them either. So, x E z is possible.

SE (Southeast):
x SE z means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x), which means the southernmost point of x is north of or on the northernmost point of y. And from y B z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y), which means the northernmost point of y is north of or on the northernmost point of z. This implies infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(z), which means the southernmost point of x is north of or on the northernmost point of z. But for x to be SE of z, we need the northernmost point of z to be north of the southernmost point of x, which contradicts our finding. So, x SE z is not possible.

S (South):
x S z means supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
Using similar reasoning as for SE, we find that infy(x) >= infy(z), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x S z is not possible.

SW (Southwest):
x SW z means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y. And from y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), which means the westernmost point of y is east of or on the westernmost point of z. But these don't directly constrain the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). It's possible for the easternmost point of x to be west of the westernmost point of z, but it's also possible for it to be east.

But there's an issue with the y-coordinate as well. As seen for SE and S, the y-coordinate requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) leads to a contradiction.

So, x SW z is not possible.

W (West):
x W z means supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
Using similar reasoning as for SW, we find that the y-coordinate requirements can be satisfied, but the x-coordinate requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) is not guaranteed. But is it possible? 

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y. And from y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), which means the westernmost point of y is east of or on the westernmost point of z. But this doesn't directly constrain the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

However, if we think about the most extreme case, where y is small and at the eastern boundary of z, and x is just slightly east of y, then we can have supx(x) (the easternmost point of x) to be east of infx(z) (the westernmost point of z). This means x can't be west of z, so x W z is not possible, I believe.

Actually let's see if I can prove this more rigorously, I think my reasoning about W is not convincing yet.

From x NE y: 
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (the easternmost point of y is west of or on the westernmost point of x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (the northernmost point of y is south of or on the southernmost point of x)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the westernmost point of z is west of or on the westernmost point of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the easternmost point of y is west of or on the easternmost point of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (the southernmost point of z is south of or on the southernmost point of y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (the northernmost point of y is south of or on the northernmost point of z)

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (the easternmost point of x is west of or on the westernmost point of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the southernmost point of z is south of or on the southernmost point of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the northernmost point of x is south of or on the northernmost point of z)

From x NE y and y B z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

Now, infx(y) is the westernmost point of y, so it's necessarily west of supx(y). Thus, infx(y) <= supx(y). Combining with the earlier inequalities, we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

This gives us:
infx(z) <= infx(x)

This inequality doesn't provide a clear relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). But for x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). If infx(z) <= infx(x), then it's possible that supx(x) > infx(z), which would mean x is not entirely west of z. But it's also possible that supx(x) <= infx(z), which would mean x is entirely west of z.

So, from the given constraints, I can't conclusively determine if x W z is possible or not.

Wait, if infx(z) <= infx(x), then the westernmost point of z is west of or on the westernmost point of x. For x to be completely west of z, the easternmost point of x should be west of or on the westernmost point of z. That's supx(x) <= infx(z).

But if infx(z) <= infx(x), then it's unlikely that supx(x) <= infx(z), because the westernmost point of x is always west of the easternmost point of x. So, it's unlikely that x is entirely west of z.

OK, let's go back to the previous claim I made:
"From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y. And from y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), which means the westernmost point of y is east of or on the westernmost point of z."

Ah, I'm making an error again. If infx(z) <= infx(y), it means the westernmost point of z is west of or on the westernmost point of y, not the other way around.

OK let me reason again. We're asking if supx(x) <= infx(z) (x should be entirely to the west of z).

We know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (the westernmost point of x is east of or on the easternmost point of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the westernmost point of z is west of or on the westernmost point of y)

For x to be entirely west of z, every point in x needs to be west of every point in z. Most specifically, the easternmost point of x (supx(x)) should be west of the westernmost point of z (infx(z)). So, supx(x) <= infx(z).

But we've established that infx(x) >= supx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). 

We also know, as a general principle, that infx(x) <= supx(x) and infx(y) <= supx(y).

Let me trace through chains to see if we can constrain the position of supx(x) relative to infx(z). From the above, we have:
infx(x) >= supx(y) >= infx(y) >= infx(z)

So, infx(x) >= infx(z). And since infx(x) <= supx(x), we have supx(x) >= infx(x) >= infx(z). This is the opposite of what we need for x to be west of z. We need supx(x) <= infx(z), but we've shown that supx(x) >= infx(z).

So, x can't be west of z, so x W z is not possible. And by similar reasoning, x can't be in the southwest (SW) or the northwest (NW) of z.

OK I think my mistake is in the expression infx(x) >= supx(y) >= infx(y) >= infx(z). Actually from supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y) we can't infer a direct relationship between supx(y) and infx(y). This is because the inequality isn't transitive.

OK, let me try a simpler approach.

From the definition: x NE y means x is entirely in the northeast quadrant of y, and y B z means y is entirely within the bounding box of z. 

If x is entirely in the northeast quadrant of y, and y is entirely within the bounding box of z, the easternmost point of y is to the left of the westernmost point of x. and the northernmost point of y is below the southernmost point of x.

If y is inside z, then y can't be to the left of the leftmost part of z, or below the bottom part of z, or to the right of the rightmost part of z, or above the top part of z. This means the westernmost, southernmost, easternmost, and northernmost points of y are inside the corresponding boundaries of z.

For x to be west of z, the easternmost point of x should be to the left of the westernmost point of z. But if the easternmost point of y is to the left of the westernmost point of x, and the westernmost point of z is to the left of the westernmost point of y, then the easternmost point of x can't be to the left of the westernmost point of z. So, x can't be west of z. Similarly, x can't be southwest or northwest of z.

And for x to be south of z, the northernmost point of x should be below the southernmost point of z. But if the northernmost point of y is below the southernmost point of x, and the southernmost point of z is below the southernmost point of y, then the northernmost point of x can't be below the southernmost point of z. So, x can't be south of z. Similarly, x can't be southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, NE, and E.

Actually my argument is getting repetitive and not very clear. Let me see if I can use the explicit inequalities to derive the result but by assuming a suitable configuration rather than having to derive it from scratch.

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let's combine these to understand the relationship between x and z.

x B z is possible: If y is small and inside z, and x is just slightly northeast of y but still inside z.

x N z is possible: If y is in the southern part of z, and x is northeast of y and extends north of z.

x NE z is possible: If y is in the southwestern corner of z, and x is northeast of y and outside z.

x E z is possible: If y is in the western part of z, and x is northeast of y and extends east of z.

Now, let's verify if specific x-z relationships are impossible using the given constraints.

For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x), which means the northernmost point of y is south of or on the southernmost point of x. And from y B z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y), which means the southernmost point of z is south of or on the southernmost point of y. This gives us infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) >= infy(z). This implies infy(x) >= infy(z). For x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But since supy(x) >= infy(x) (the top of a region is always higher than the bottom), we get supy(x) >= infy(x) >= infy(z), which is the opposite of what we need.

So, x S z is not possible.

Similarly, x SE z, x SW z, x W z, and x NW z are not possible due to the constraints on the x and y coordinates from the given conditions.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, NE, and E.

Alright, now I'm convinced we have the correct answer!

Possible relations between region x and region z: B, N, NE, E.

ANSWER:

The cardinal direction relations between x and z can be determined by analyzing the constraints.

Given:
- x is NE of y
- y is B of z

For x to be NE of y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of y)

For y to be B of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Analyzing possible relations:

1. B: If y is a small region inside z and x is just northeast of y but still inside z, then x B z is possible.

2. N: If y is in the southern part of z and x is northeast of y extending north of z, then x N z is possible.

3. NE: If y is in the southwest corner of z and x is northeast of y extending outside z, then x NE z is possible.

4. E: If y is in the western part of z and x is northeast of y extending east of z, then x E z is possible.

Relations that are not possible:
- S, SE: Since x is north of y and y is inside z, x cannot be south of z
- SW, W: Since x is east of y and y is inside z, x cannot be west of z
- NW: Since x is northeast of y and y is inside z, x cannot be northwest of z

Possible relations: B, N, NE, E
