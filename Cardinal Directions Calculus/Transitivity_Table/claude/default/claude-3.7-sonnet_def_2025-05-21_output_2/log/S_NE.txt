PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what we can deduce about the relationship between region x and region z, given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Let's recall the definitions of the cardinal relations:

- x S y means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From x S y, we know:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
2. infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y NE z, we know:
4. supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
5. supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, let's see what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z:

First, let's consider the y-coordinate relationship:
From 1 and 5, we have:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x). So, based on the y-coordinate, x could be N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B relative to z.

Now, let's consider the x-coordinate relationship:
From 2 and 4, we have:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)

This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which implies that x is to the east of z. This restricts the possible relations to: NE, E, or SE.

From the y-coordinate analysis, we know that all relations are possible. But from the x-coordinate analysis, only NE, E, or SE are possible.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, or SE.

Actually, let me check this result by visualizing the situation.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Based on the definitions:
- x S y means x is south of y
- y NE z means y is northeast of z

So, we have:
- x is to the south of y
- y is to the northeast of z

Now, if y is to the northeast of z, it means y is both to the north and to the east of z.
And if x is to the south of y, it means x is below y.

Let's establish a rough coordinate system for clarity.
If z is at the origin (0,0), then y is in the quadrant where x is positive and y is positive, i.e., (some positive number, some positive number).
Now, x is to the south of y, which means it's at (some positive number within y's range, some negative or zero number or even a positive number less than y's y-coordinate).

Hmm, I'm not being precise enough. Let me use the formal definitions.

Let's define the bounding boxes of regions x, y, and z:
- x: [infx(x), supx(x)] × [infy(x), supy(x)]
- y: [infx(y), supx(y)] × [infy(y), supy(y)]
- z: [infx(z), supx(z)] × [infy(z), supy(z)]

From x S y, we have:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
2. infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y NE z, we have:
4. supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
5. supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, let's derive the relationship between x and z.

From 4 and 2, we get:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
=> supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z. However, the y-coordinate relationship is not constrained.

Let's check all possibilities:

1. x N z: This would mean supy(z) ≤ infy(x). 
From 5, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
And from 1, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
But from these, we can't really determine the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).
For x to be N of z, it needs to be above z. This is possible if x, while being S of y, is still N of z.

2. x NE z: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
We've already established that supx(z) ≤ infx(x). And, as explained above, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible.
So, x NE z is a possibility.

3. x E z: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x). The other two conditions are not constrained by the given information.
So, x E z is a possibility.

4. x SE z: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x). The other condition is not constrained by the given information.
So, x SE z is a possibility.

5. x S z: This would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z). 
Therefore, x S z is not possible.

6. x SW z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
Therefore, x SW z is not possible.

7. x W z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
Therefore, x W z is not possible.

8. x NW z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
Therefore, x NW z is not possible.

9. x B z: This would mean infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
Therefore, x B z is not possible.

OK so we've confirmed that the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, or SE.

Actually let me just double-check my reasoning for S, SW, W, NW, and B. We established supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means x is strictly to the east of z. So x cannot be S, SW, W, NW, or B of z because all of these relations require some overlap in the x-coordinate, or for x to be to the west of z.

Actually no, I need to be precise here:

1. x S z means: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

2. x SW z means: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(x) > infx(x) >= supx(z) > infx(z). This contradicts the condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

3. x W z means: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(x) > infx(x) >= supx(z) > infx(z). This contradicts the condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

4. x NW z means: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(x) > infx(x) >= supx(z) > infx(z). This contradicts the condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x cannot be NW of z.

5. x B z means: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(x) > infx(x) >= supx(z). This contradicts the condition supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

Now, for the remaining possibilities:

6. x N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

Ok so x cannot be N of z either.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, or SE.

Actually, let me just revisit the relation x N z. I previously said:

6. x N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

I don't think this is a correct definition of the N relation. Let me check again.

a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

So, x N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

From our constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means that x is to the east of z.
- This contradicts the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which would mean that the x-projection of z contains the x-projection of x.

So, x cannot be N of z.

Alright, I've confirmed that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- NE (Northeast): x is to the northeast of z.
- E (East): x is to the east of z.
- SE (Southeast): x is to the southeast of z.

Wait, let me double-check this. From the definitions:

- a N b means: supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a), and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).
- a NE b means: supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).
- a E b means: supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).
- a SE b means: supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).

OK let's reconsider the constraints we have:

From x S y:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
2. infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y NE z:
4. supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
5. supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From 4 and 2:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
So, supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

From 1 and 5:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But from these, we can't derive a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x). This means that in terms of the y-coordinate, x could be above z, at the same level as z, or below z.

Now, let's check all the possible relations and see which ones are compatible with supx(z) ≤ infx(x):

- x N z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
  But from supx(z) ≤ infx(x), we have infx(x) ≥ supx(z), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

- x NE z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
  We already know supx(z) ≤ infx(x). We need to check if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is compatible with our constraints.
  From 5 and 1, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). This doesn't directly give us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).
  So, x can potentially be NE of z if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

- x E z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  We already know supx(z) ≤ infx(x). We need to check if the other two conditions are compatible with our constraints.
  From our given constraints, we can't directly derive the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x) or between supy(x) and supy(z).
  So, x can potentially be E of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

- x SE z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
  We already know supx(z) ≤ infx(x). We need to check if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is compatible with our constraints.
  From 1, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't directly give us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
  So, x can potentially be SE of z if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

For the remaining relations (S, SW, W, NW, B), we've already established that x being to the east of z (due to supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) is incompatible with these relations.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, or SE.

Let me check by drawing out a diagram. If we have a y-axis pointing upward and an x-axis pointing to the right, then:

- If z is at the origin, then y is in the NE quadrant. 
- If y is in the NE quadrant, then x is to the S of y, which, depending on exactly where y is and how large x is, can place x in the E, SE, or NE quadrant relative to z.

This confirms our conclusion: The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, or SE.

Actually, let me be even more specific and provide a concrete example for each:

1. x NE z: If z is at the origin (0,0), y is at (3,3), and x is at (2,1), then x is to the NE of z.
2. x E z: If z is at the origin (0,0), y is at (3,3), and x is at (2,0), then x is to the E of z.
3. x SE z: If z is at the origin (0,0), y is at (3,3), and x is at (2,-1), then x is to the SE of z.

Actually, let's think in terms of the tile-based representation. If we have a 3x3 grid centered on the reference region, then:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | B | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

Given:
- x is S of y
- y is NE of z

For y to be NE of z, z is at B (the middle) and y is at the NE tile.
For x to be S of y, if y is at the NE tile, then x can be below y, which, depending on the exact shape and position, can place x in the E, SE, or NE tile relative to z.

I think I'm overthinking this, and our original conclusion is correct:

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, or SE.

Actually, let's be completely sure by using the constraints I wrote earlier.

From the conditions:
- x S y means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

From these, I derived:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (meaning x is to the east of z).

Now, I need to determine the y-coordinate relationship between x and z.

From the given conditions, I know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y).
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NE z).

These constraints imply that both x and z have their upper bounds below the lower bound of y in the y-coordinate.

In terms of the tile-based representation, we know:
- z is at the origin (for reference).
- y is to the NE of z.
- x is to the S of y.

If y is to the NE of z, it means y is both to the north and to the east of z.
If x is to the S of y, it means x is to the south of y.

Now, the question is: Where can x be in relation to z?

Since y is to the NE of z and x is to the S of y, let's visualize it in a rough grid. If z is at the center:

```
    |   |   
----+---+---
    | z |   
----+---+---
    |   |   
```

If y is to the NE of z:

```
    |   | y 
----+---+---
    | z |   
----+---+---
    |   |   
```

If x is to the S of y, it would be:

```
    |   | y 
----+---+---
    | z | x (potentially)
----+---+---
    |   | x (potentially)
```

From this, we can see that x could potentially be:
- To the E of z.
- To the SE of z.
- To the NE of z (though this is less intuitive, it's possible if x is positioned correctly).

Let me further refine this with the constraints:

1. x NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   We know supx(z) ≤ infx(x). For the other condition, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). From our constraints, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we don't know the direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) or between infy(y) and infy(x).
   So, it's possible for x to be NE of z if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

2. x E z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We know supx(z) ≤ infx(x). For the other conditions, we don't have direct relationships from our constraints. However, it's possible for x to be E of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

3. x SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   We know supx(z) ≤ infx(x). For the other condition, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but we don't know the direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between infy(y) and infy(z).
   So, it's possible for x to be SE of z if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Given that we don't have constraints ruling out any of these relations, I still hold to our conclusion: The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, or SE.

Actually, since I've overthought this problem, let me just re-check from the very basic definitions. 

Given the cardinal direction framework using a tile-based approach, the tiles are defined as follows:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | B | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

Recalling the definitions:
- x S y means: x is in the South tile of y.
- y NE z means: y is in the Northeast tile of z.

If we place z at the center (B tile), then y is in the NE tile. If x is in the S tile of y, let's visualize a possibility:

```
    |   | y 
----+---+---
    | z |   
----+---+---
    |   | x 
```

Here, x appears to be in the SE tile from z's perspective. However, the S tile of y isn't necessarily directly below y; it spans the entire width of y. So, x could also be:

```
    |   | y 
----+---+---
    | z | x 
----+---+---
    |   |   
```

In this case, x appears to be in the E tile from z's perspective. Or even:

```
    |   | y 
----+---+---
    | z |   
----+---+---
    | x |   
```

Here, x would be in the S tile from z's perspective. But then it wouldn't satisfy x S y because it wouldn't be in the S tile of y.

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself by inappropriately conflating 2D definitions on a grid. Let's more carefully define the regions:

Recall:
- x S y if and only if supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y NE z if and only if supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

For the question, we want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's break it down:

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From x S y, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

Combine the first conditions from each:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
So, supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

From this, we can conclude: x is to the east of z in some way.

Let's figure out the y-coordinate relationship by combining:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

These conditions tell us that both z and x have upper bounds below the lower bound of y in the y-coordinate. But they don't directly tell us the relationship between the upper bounds of z and x. So, x can be to the north, south, or at the same level as z.

Let's check:

1. For x NE z:
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We know: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - The condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not directly determined from our constraints.
   - However, it's possible for x to be positioned such that supy(z) ≤ infy(x) holds, meaning x could be NE of z.

2. For x E z:
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We know: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - The conditions infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) are not directly determined from our constraints.
   - However, it's possible for x to be positioned such that these conditions hold, meaning x could be E of z.

3. For x SE z:
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We know: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - The condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is not directly determined from our constraints.
   - However, it's possible for x to be positioned such that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) holds, meaning x could be SE of z.

Let's check if S is a possibility for x with respect to z:
- x S z means: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- We know: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- Given supx(z) ≤ infx(x), it's impossible for infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z) to both hold. Because:
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) implies that the leftmost part of z is to the left of or at the same position as the leftmost part of x.
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) implies that the rightmost part of x is to the left of or at the same position as the rightmost part of z.
  - Together, they mean the x-projection of x is completely contained within the x-projection of z.
  - But supx(z) ≤ infx(x) implies that the rightmost part of z is to the left of or at the same position as the leftmost part of x, i.e., z and x don't overlap in the x-direction.
  - These are contradictory.
So, x S z is not a possibility.

Similarly, x B z implies infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which for the same reason is incompatible with supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

The same argument applies for x SW z, x W z, x NW z, and x N z. They are all incompatible with the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

So, after careful consideration, I come to the same conclusion: The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, or SE.

Let's think of a specific example to verify this:

Let's define the bounding boxes for our regions:
- z: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- y: [2, 3] × [2, 3]
- x position 1: [2.5, 3.5] × [0.5, 1.5] (x is E of z)
- x position 2: [2.5, 3.5] × [1.5, 1.9] (x is NE of z)
- x position 3: [2.5, 3.5] × [-0.5, -0.1] (x is SE of z)

Checking for y NE z:
- supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(y) = 2 (True)
- supy(z) = 1 ≤ infy(y) = 2 (True)
So, y is NE of z.

For x position 1 (E of z), checking for x S y:
- supy(x) = 1.5 ≤ infy(y) = 2 (True)
- infx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 2.5 (True)
- supx(x) = 3.5 ≤ supx(y) = 3 (False)

Hmm, this doesn't satisfy x S y. Let's adjust:
- x position 1: [2.5, 2.9] × [0.5, 1.5] (x is E of z)

Checking for x S y:
- supy(x) = 1.5 ≤ infy(y) = 2 (True)
- infx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 2.5 (True)
- supx(x) = 2.9 ≤ supx(y) = 3 (True)
So, x is S of y.

Checking for x E z:
- supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2.5 (True)
- infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 0.5 (True)
- supy(x) = 1.5 ≤ supy(z) = 1 (False)

Let's adjust again:
- x position 1: [2.5, 2.9] × [0, 0.9] (x is E of z)

Checking for x S y:
- supy(x) = 0.9 ≤ infy(y) = 2 (True)
- infx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 2.5 (True)
- supx(x) = 2.9 ≤ supx(y) = 3 (True)
So, x is S of y.

Checking for x E z:
- supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2.5 (True)
- infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 0 (True)
- supy(x) = 0.9 ≤ supy(z) = 1 (True)
So, x is E of z.

For x position 2 (NE of z), checking for x S y:
- supy(x) = 1.9
Let's adjust the positions for NE:
- x position 2: [2.5, 2.9] × [1.3, 1.9] (aiming for x to be NE of z)

Checking for x S y:
- supy(x) = 1.9 ≤ infy(y) = 2 (True)
- infx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 2.5 (True)
- supx(x) = 2.9 ≤ supx(y) = 3 (True)
So, x is S of y.

Checking for x NE z:
- supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2.5 (True)
- supy(z) = 1 ≤ infy(x) = 1.3 (True)
So, x is NE of z.

For x position 3 (SE of z), let's define:
- x position 3: [2.5, 2.9] × [-0.5, -0.1] (aiming for x to be SE of z)

Checking for x S y:
- supy(x) = -0.1 ≤ infy(y) = 2 (True)
- infx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 2.5 (True)
- supx(x) = 2.9 ≤ supx(y) = 3 (True)
So, x is S of y.

Checking for x SE z:
- supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2.5 (True)
- supy(x) = -0.1 ≤ infy(z) = 0 (True)
So, x is SE of z.

Great, we've verified all three possible relations: x can be E, NE, or SE of z.

One last clarification: we can rule out the x S z relation using the following:

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

So, x S z means: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

The second and third conditions, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), imply that the x-projection of z contains the x-projection of x. But from the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (derived from our original constraints), we know x is to the east of z, which contradicts the containment of x's x-projection by z's x-projection.

In conclusion, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, or SE.

ANSWER:

Looking at the given conditions, I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

From the definitions:
- x S y means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
1. From y NE z, we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
2. From x S y, we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
3. Therefore, supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

This means x must be to the east of z in some way.

For the y-coordinate relationship, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NE z)

These don't give us a direct constraint between x and z in the y-direction, so x could be above, below, or at the same level as z.

Checking each possible relation and considering the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x):
- N, NW, W, SW, S, and B relations are impossible because they require x to overlap with z in the x-direction
- Only NE, E, and SE are possible

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, SE.
