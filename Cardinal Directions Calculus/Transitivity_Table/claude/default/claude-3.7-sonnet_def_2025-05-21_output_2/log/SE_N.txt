PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

1) Region x is SE of region y. This means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2) Region y is N of region z. This means:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-projection of z)

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's consider the x-coordinates first:
- From (1), we know supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From (2), we know supx(y) <= supx(z)

These don't directly give us a constraint between infx(x) and supx(z). This means x could be East of z, or there could be some overlap in the x-projection.

Now, let's consider the y-coordinates:
- From (1), we know supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From (2), we know supy(z) <= infy(y)

So, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), but this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Let's visualize this to think more clearly:

    y (North of z)
  /
 /
z
  \
   \
    x (SE of y)

If we try to place these regions:
- z is below y
- x is to the southeast of y

So, x could be to the east of z (if x is shifted enough to the right), or it could be to the southeast of z (if x is both to the right and below z), or it could even be to the south of z (if x is directly below z).

Let's check more systematically by considering the definitions of the cardinal directions:

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the y-projection of z)

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the x-projection of z)

For the E relationship between x and z:
- We know supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x being SE of y)
- And we know supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y being N of z)
- So, if supx(z) = supx(y), then supx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies one condition for x to be E of z.
- For the y-projection, we don't have enough information from the given conditions.

For the SE relationship between x and z:
- The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) might be satisfied as discussed above.
- For supy(x) <= infy(z), we know supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x being SE of y) and supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y being N of z). This doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

For the S relationship between x and z:
- For supy(x) <= infy(z), the same logic as in the SE case applies.
- For the x-projection, we can't determine from the given conditions.

I think I need to be a bit more careful in my reasoning, as I might have missed some constraints.

Let's try a different approach. From the given conditions:

1) x is SE of y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2) y is N of z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-projection of z)

Given that y is within the x-projection of z and x is to the east of y, we can say:
- If infx(y) = infx(z), then x is to the east of both y and z.
- If supx(y) = supx(z), then x is to the east of both y and z.
- If infx(y) > infx(z) and supx(y) < supx(z), then y is completely within the x-projection of z, and x is still to the east of y. However, this doesn't guarantee that x is to the east of z. X could be within the x-projection of z.

Now, for the y-coordinates:
- y is to the north of z, so supy(z) <= infy(y).
- x is to the south of y, so supy(x) <= infy(y).

But we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or infy(x) and infy(z).

Hmm, actually, let's take a step back and think about this more systematically. We need to determine which of the nine possible cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) can apply for the relationship between x and z.

N: For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
   - This doesn't guarantee supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Additionally, with x being to the east of y, and y being within the x-projection of z, it's possible that x is not within the x-projection of z.
   - So, x might not be N of z.

NE: For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - Similar to the N case, we can't guarantee supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - And for supx(z) <= infx(x), we know supx(y) <= infx(x), but the relationship between supx(z) and supx(y) is that supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - So, x might not be NE of z.

E: For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - As discussed above, we can't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - Additionally, we don't have clear constraints on the y-projections.
   - So, x might or might not be E of z.

Oh wait, I've noticed that I might be oversimplifying the reasoning. Let me try again.

Let's start with the known facts:
x is SE of y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

y is N of z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-projection of z)

Let's try to derive the relationship between x and z by considering the constraints on the x and y projections separately.

For the x-projection:
- We know supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y).
- We also know supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-projection of z).
- So, supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)).
- If infx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(z). This means x might overlap with the x-projection of z, or x might be to the east of z.
- If supx(z) < infx(x), then supx(y) <= supx(z) < infx(x). This means x is to the east of z.

For the y-projection:
- We know supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y).
- We also know supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z).
- So, max(supy(x), supy(z)) <= infy(y).
- If supy(x) <= supy(z), then both x and z are to the south of y, with x potentially further south than z or at the same level.
- If supy(z) < supy(x), then both x and z are to the south of y, with z potentially further south than x.

From these constraints, x could be:
- E of z: If supx(z) < infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- SE of z: If supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
- NE of z: If supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- S of z: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
- N of z: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- B of z: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Actually, let's more carefully consider what we can derive from the given constraints:

1. From x is SE of y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. From y is N of z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

Let's place additional constraints based on the transitivity:

3. From (1) and (2), we can derive:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from 2)
     This doesn't give us a direct constraint between infx(x) and supx(z).
   
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (from 1) and supy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2)
     Again, this doesn't give us a direct constraint between supy(x) and supy(z) or infy(x) and infy(z).

So, we're not getting clear constraints for a unique relationship between x and z. This means multiple possibilities might exist.

Let's construct an example scenario to see if we can determine the possible relationships:

Scenario 1:
Let's say region z is the unit square with its bottom-left corner at the origin: z = [0, 1] x [0, 1].
Let's place y as a unit square directly above z: y = [0, 1] x [1, 2]. This ensures that y is N of z (condition 2).
Now, let's place x as a unit square to the southeast of y: x = [1, 2] x [0, 1]. This ensures that x is SE of y (condition 1).

In this scenario, x and z are side by side, with x to the east of z. So, one possible relation is that x is E of z.

Scenario 2:
Let's keep z and y the same as in Scenario 1. But let's place x as a smaller square to the southeast of y: x = [1.5, 2] x [0.5, 0.8]. Again, x is SE of y (condition 1).

In this scenario, x is to the east and slightly below z. It's not directly south or directly east of z, it's in a position that could be described as SE of z.

Scenario 3:
Let's keep z and y the same as in Scenario 1. But let's place x as a smaller square even further southeast of y: x = [1.5, 2] x [0, 0.5]. Again, x is SE of y (condition 1).

In this scenario, x is to the east and sufficiently south of z. This would be considered SE of z.

It seems from the scenarios I've constructed, the relation between x and z could be E or SE. Let's check if there are other possibilities.

Actually, I'm going to try a different approach. Let's make a mental model and think about the relation in terms of constraints.

Assume:
1. x is SE of y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y is N of z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z)

Looking at the definition of cardinal directions (my earlier attempt was actually correct):

N: supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
NE: supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x)
E: supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
SE: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
S: supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
SW: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
W: supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
NW: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
B: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, let's see which of these cardinal directions could be satisfied based on the constraints we have:

N: We need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from constraint 2)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (from constraint 1)
   - If supy(x) < infy(x), then supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) < infy(x) doesn't necessarily mean supy(z) <= infy(x). So, we can't conclude that x is N of z.
   
NE: We need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - As discussed above, we can't guarantee supy(z) <= infy(x) from the given constraints.
   - For the x-projection, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) (from constraint 1) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from constraint 2).
   - This implies that supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)).
   - If supx(z) < infx(x), then supx(y) <= supx(z) < infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x), satisfying the x-condition for NE.
   - If infx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(z), which doesn't necessarily mean supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - So, the x-condition for NE might or might not be satisfied.

   In summary, for NE, the y-condition can't be guaranteed from the given constraints, and the x-condition might or might not be satisfied.

Wait, I think I'm making overly complex. Let's take a step back a try a clearer approach.

Let me set up some concrete regions that follow our constraints and see what's the relationship between x and z:

Scenario 1:
z: [0, 1] x [0, 1] (unit square at the origin)
y: [0.25, 0.75] x [2, 3] (smaller square directly above z)
x: [1, 2] x [1, 1.5] (square to the southeast of y)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 0.25 and supx(y) = 0.75 <= supx(z) = 1)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 0.75 <= infx(x) = 1 and supy(x) = 1.5 <= infy(y) = 2)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
infx(x) = 1 > supx(z) = 1, so supx(z) <= infx(x).
infy(x) = 1 > supy(z) = 1, so supy(z) <= infy(x).

This means x is NE of z in this scenario.

Scenario 2:
z: [0, 1] x [0, 1] (unit square at the origin)
y: [0.25, 0.75] x [2, 3] (smaller square directly above z)
x: [1, 2] x [0, 0.5] (square to the southeast of y but below z)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 0.25 and supx(y) = 0.75 <= supx(z) = 1)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 0.75 <= infx(x) = 1 and supy(x) = 0.5 <= infy(y) = 2)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
infx(x) = 1 > supx(z) = 1, so supx(z) <= infx(x).
supy(x) = 0.5 < infy(z) = 0, so supy(x) <= infy(z).

Hmm, that's not right. I made a mistake in the definition. Let me correct it.

infy(z) = 0, so supy(x) = 0.5 > infy(z) = 0. So supy(x) <= infy(z) doesn't hold.

Let me re-do Scenario 2:

Scenario 2 (corrected):
z: [0, 1] x [0, 1] (unit square at the origin)
y: [0.25, 0.75] x [2, 3] (smaller square directly above z)
x: [1, 2] x [0, 0.5] (square to the southeast of y, next to z)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 0.25 and supx(y) = 0.75 <= supx(z) = 1)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 0.75 <= infx(x) = 1 and supy(x) = 0.5 <= infy(y) = 2)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
infx(x) = 1 > supx(z) = 1, so x is to the East of z.
infy(x) = 0 = infy(z) and supy(x) = 0.5 <= supy(z) = 1, so x's y-projection is contained in z's y-projection. Thus, x is E of z.

Ok, so we've determined that the relation between x and z can be E or NE. Let's create a scenario where x is SE of z:

Scenario 3:
z: [0, 2] x [1, 3] (larger rectangle)
y: [0.5, 1.5] x [3, 4] (smaller rectangle directly above z)
x: [2, 3] x [0, 1] (rectangle to the southeast of y and below z)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 3 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 0.5 and supx(y) = 1.5 <= supx(z) = 2)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 1.5 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 1 <= infy(y) = 3)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
infx(x) = 2 = supx(z), so x is not to the East of z as per the strict definition. 

Wait, actually, the condition for E is: supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Since infx(x) = 2 = supx(z), the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.

So, in the revised scenario 3:
infx(x) = 2 >= supx(z) = 2, so supx(z) <= infx(x).
infy(x) = 0 < infy(z) = 1, so infy(z) > infy(x).

This fails the y-projection condition for E. Let's check if x is SE of z:
supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2, so supx(z) <= infx(x).
supy(x) = 1 <= infy(z) = 1, so supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, in this scenario, x is SE of z.

Ok, I'm starting to see the pattern. Let's systematically check each cardinal direction:

For E: supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We've shown in Scenario 2 that x can be E of z.

For NE: supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - We've shown in Scenario 1 that x can be NE of z.

For SE: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We've shown in Scenario 3 that x can be SE of z.

For N, NW, W, SW, S, B, let's see if we can create scenarios where these relationships hold.

For S: supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - Based on the constraint that x is SE of y and y is N of z, our intuition is that x should be to the east of z, or perhaps to the northeast or southeast. It seems unlikely that x is directly south of z, but let's see if we can construct a scenario where this is true.

Let's try:
Scenario 4:
z: [0, 3] x [1, 3] (larger rectangle)
y: [1, 2] x [3, 4] (smaller rectangle directly above z)
x: [1, 2] x [0, 1] (rectangle directly below y and south of z)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 3 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 3)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 2 = infx(x) = 1, wait that doesn't satisfy supx(y) <= infx(x). Let me revise.)

Revised Scenario 4:
z: [0, 3] x [1, 3] (larger rectangle)
y: [0.5, 1.5] x [3, 4] (smaller rectangle directly above z)
x: [1.5, 2.5] x [0, 1] (rectangle directly below y and south of z)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 3 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 0.5 and supx(y) = 1.5 <= supx(z) = 3)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 1.5 <= infx(x) = 1.5 and supy(x) = 1 <= infy(y) = 3)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
infx(x) = 1.5 > infx(z) = 0 and supx(x) = 2.5 < supx(z) = 3, so infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
supy(x) = 1 <= infy(z) = 1, so supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, in this scenario, x is S of z.

OK, now we have that x can be E, NE, SE, or S of z. I'll check if x can be N of z.

For N: supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Let's create a scenario:
Scenario 5:
z: [0, 3] x [0, 1] (large rectangle at the bottom)
y: [1, 2] x [1, 2] (square in the middle)
x: [1, 2] x [2, 3] (square at the top)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 1 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 3)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 2 = infx(x) = 1, which doesn't satisfy supx(y) <= infx(x). Let me revise.)

Scneario 5 (revised):
z: [0, 3] x [0, 1] (large rectangle at the bottom)
y: [1, 2] x [1, 2] (square in the middle)
x: [2, 3] x [2, 3] (square at the top-right)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 1 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 3)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 3 is not <= infy(y) = 1. So this doesn't satisfy the condition.)

Let me try again. I keep making a mistake in the y-coordinates.

Scenario 5 (revised again):
z: [0, 3] x [0, 1] (large rectangle at the bottom)
y: [1, 2] x [1, 2] (square in the middle)
x: [2, 3] x [0.5, 1] (rectangle to the right of y)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 1 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 3)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 1 <= infy(y) = 1)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
infx(x) = 2 > infx(z) = 0 and supx(x) = 3 = supx(z), so infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
infy(x) = 0.5 > supy(z) = 1, which doesn't satisfy the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for N.

OK, let's try again.

Scenario 5 (revised yet again):
z: [0, 3] x [0, 1] (large rectangle at the bottom)
y: [1, 2] x [2, 3] (square in the middle)
x: [2, 3] x [1.5, 2] (rectangle to the right of y)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 3)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 2)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
infx(x) = 2 > infx(z) = 0 and supx(x) = 3 = supx(z), so infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
infy(x) = 1.5 > supy(z) = 1, so supy(z) <= infy(x), which satisfies the condition for N.

So, in this scenario, x is N of z.

OK, now we have that x can be E, NE, SE, S, or N of z.

Let's check if x can be B (inside) of z:

For B: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Another scenario:
Scenario 6:
z: [0, 3] x [0, 3] (large square)
y: [1, 2] x [3, 4] (small square above z)
x: [2, 2.5] x [1, 2] (small rectangle inside z)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 3 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 3)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 3)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
infx(x) = 2 > infx(z) = 0 and supx(x) = 2.5 < supx(z) = 3, so infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
infy(x) = 1 > infy(z) = 0 and supy(x) = 2 < supy(z) = 3, so infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

So, in this scenario, x is B (inside) of z.

Let's check if x can be NW of z:

For NW: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

Scenario 7:
z: [3, 4] x [0, 1] (rectangle on the right)
y: [1, 2] x [1, 2] (square in the middle)
x: [0, 1] x [2, 3] (square on the left and top)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 1 and infx(z) = 3 > infx(y) = 1, which doesn't satisfy the condition. I'll try again.)

Scenario 7 (revised):
z: [3, 4] x [0, 1] (rectangle on the right)
y: [2, 3] x [1, 2] (square in the middle)
x: [1, 2] x [2, 3] (square on the left and top)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 1 and infx(z) = 3 > infx(y) = 2, which again doesn't satisfy the condition.)

Hmm, if z is to the east of y, and y is to the north of z, and x is to the southeast of y, it seems that x cannot be to the northwest of z. This makes intuitive sense.

Let's try to see if x can be W, SW, or NW of z by checking if we can construct scenarios that satisfy the geometric constraints.

For x to be NW of z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

If y is N of z, then supy(z) <= infy(y). If x is SE of y, then supy(x) <= infy(y). This implies that supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), but we can't directly derive a relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) from these. So, the y-condition for NW might or might not be satisfied.

For the x-condition: supx(x) <= infx(z), we need x to be to the west of z. But if y is within the x-projection of z (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)) and x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x)), then infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This implies that infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). If z is to the west of x, then supx(z) <= infx(x). But this doesn't imply supx(x) <= infx(z), which is the x-condition for NW.

In fact, from the conditions: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), we can derive: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This means that z's x-projection starts at or to the left of y's x-projection, and x's x-projection starts at or to the right of the end of y's x-projection. If infx(z) < infx(y), then z extends to the left of y. But this doesn't necessarily mean that supx(x) <= infx(z), which is the x-condition for NW.

Since we can't establish the x-condition for NW from the given constraints, x might not be NW of z.

Let me try and check if x can be W of z:

For W: supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the same reasoning above, it seems that if y is within the x-projection of z (which is one of the conditions for y being N of z), and x is to the east of y (one of the conditions for x being SE of y), then z is to the east of y, and x is to the east of y. This doesn't align with x being to the west of z, which is one of the conditions for x being W of z.

Given the constraints, it seems that x cannot be W, SW, or NW of z. Let's verify one more time that it can't be SW:

For SW: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

As discussed for W, the x-condition (supx(x) <= infx(z)) can't be satisfied given the constraints.

OK. My final conclusion is that based on the given conditions "x is SE of y" and "y is N of z", the possible relations between x and z are: E, NE, SE, S, N, and B. 

Actually, let me double check N and B because I'm not fully confident:

1. From (1) x is SE of y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. From (2) y is N of z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-projection of z)

For N: supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), we know supy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2) and supy(x) <= infy(y) (from 1). If infy(x) < supy(x), then supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y) don't imply supy(z) <= infy(x). So this can't be proven for sure.
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), we know infx(z) <= infx(y) (from 2) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1). This implies that infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we know supx(y) <= supx(z) (from 2). But we don't have a constraint that relates supx(x) to supx(y) or supx(z). So this can't be proven for sure.

Wait, this doesn't fully rule out N. 

OK, let's construct a scenario:

Scenario 5:
z: [0, 3] x [0, 1] (large rectangle at the bottom)
y: [1, 2] x [2, 3] (square in the middle)
x: [2, 2.5] x [1.5, 2] (small rectangle above and to the right of y)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 3)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 2), though I feel like I might be making a mistake. Let me double-check.

Actually, the condition for x to be SE of y is supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).

In our scenario:
supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2 (satisfies)
supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 2 (satisfies)

So, x is SE of y (though it's more like E).

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
infx(x) = 2 > infx(z) = 0, so infx(z) <= infx(x).
supx(x) = 2.5 < supx(z) = 3, so supx(x) <= supx(z).
infy(x) = 1.5 > supy(z) = 1, so supy(z) <= infy(x).

These are the conditions for x being N of z, which means in this scenario, x is N of z.

So, given the constraints that "x is SE of y" and "y is N of z", we've verified that x can be E, NE, SE, S, or N of z.

For B (inside): infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We've shown in our Scenario 6 that x can be B (inside) of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: E, NE, SE, S, N, and B.

I just realized I missed something. I want to see if if x can be B (inside) of, not just contained in the bounding box of, z.

Scenario 6:
z: [0, 3] x [0, 3] (large square)
y: [1, 2] x [3, 4] (small square above z)
x: [2, 2.5] x [1, 2] (small rectangle inside z)

In this scenario:
y is N of z (as supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 3 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 3)
x is SE of y (as supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 3)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
infx(x) = 2 > infx(z) = 0 and supx(x) = 2.5 < supx(z) = 3, so infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
infy(x) = 1 > infy(z) = 0 and supy(x) = 2 < supy(z) = 3, so infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Actually, let me double check the definition of the relationship B(a, b), which is "a is inside the bouning box of b". The scenario I constructed above satisfies the B relationship as given in the initial definition.

To reiterate, b B a if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). 

Scenario 6 was:
z: [0, 3] x [0, 3] (large square)
y: [1, 2] x [3, 4] (small square above z)
x: [2, 2.5] x [1, 2] (small rectangle inside z)

a = x
b = z

infx(b) = infx(z) = 0 <= infx(a) = infx(x) = 2
supx(a) = supx(x) = 2.5 <= supx(b) = supx(z) = 3
infy(b) = infy(z) = 0 <= infy(a) = infy(x) = 1
supy(a) = supy(x) = 2 <= supy(b) = supy(z) = 3

So indeed, 0 <= 2, 2.5 <= 3, 0 <= 1, and 2 <= 3. That means that x B z, or in the terminology of the question, "B" is a possible relationship between x and z.

Actually wait, that's not right. Our intution is that we are determining the relationship "xRz", and the definition of B says than "b B a iff...". That means we are trying to check "z B x".

Actually, I'm mistaken again. I should be checking "x B z", which is "x is inside the bounding box of z". So a = x and b = z.

But again, the definintion is "b B a iff". So I need to check "z B x", which is "z is inside the bounding box of x". This means a = z and b = x. Hence, I need to check:

infx(b) = infx(x) = 2 <= infx(a) = infx(z) = 0
supx(a) = supx(z) = 3 <= supx(b) = supx(x) = 2.5
infy(b) = infy(x) = 1 <= infy(a) = infy(z) = 0
supy(a) = supy(z) = 3 <= supy(b) = supy(x) = 2

OK actually I see the problem. The way the relation is defined is: "a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)".

The issue is that based on the definition, "a B b" means that "a is inside the bounding box of b". But actually, this doesn't match the intuitive meaning, which is that "a is inside the bounding box of b" should be "b B a".

Oh, I think I've misunderstood the notation. If the notation "a B b" is read as "a bears the relation B to b", then "a B b" means "a is inside the bounding box of b", which matches the given definition.

OK, so I need to check if "x B z", which is "x is inside the bounding box of z", holds in our Scenario 6:

infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 2
supx(x) = 2.5 <= supx(z) = 3
infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 1
supy(x) = 2 <= supy(z) = 3

All four constraints are satisfied, so "x B z" holds in this scenario.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: E, NE, SE, S, N, and B.

Let's check if x can have a relationship with z in which both regions overlap:

For overlapping regions, they would have to share parts of their bounding boxes, but the relation wouldn't fall into the standard 9 cardinal directions. Since we're only considering the 9 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B), and we've already identified when x can be B (inside) of z, the remaining question is whether x can have other relations with z.

Based on the constraints and our scenarios, we've shown that x can be E, NE, SE, S, N, or B of z.

OK, I think my final answer is: the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, SE, S, N, and B.

Actually, let me check the definition of the cardinal directions again, because that doesn't actually seem right.

For E: supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
For NE: supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x)
For SE: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
For S: supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
For N: supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
For B: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Wait, I realized that some of the regions might not be satisfiable of the constraints. Let me revisit those in more detail.

Actually, let's be systematic:

Given the conditions:
x is SE of y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

y is N of z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

We're trying to determine the relationship between x and z.

For x being E of z:
One of the conditions is: supx(z) <= infx(x)
From the given conditions: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
If supx(y) = supx(z), then supx(z) = supx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x).
If supx(y) < supx(z), then we cannot directly derive a constraint between supx(z) and infx(x).

For x being NE of z:
One of the conditions is: supy(z) <= infy(x)
From the given conditions: supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
If supy(x) = infy(y), then supy(z) <= infy(y) = supy(x) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x).
If supy(x) < infy(y), then we cannot directly derive a constraint between supy(z) and infy(x).

Another condition is: supx(z) <= infx(x)
This is the same as the E case.

For x being SE of z:
One of the conditions is: supy(x) <= infy(z)
From the given conditions: supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
This doesn't give us a direct constraint between supy(x) and infy(z).

Another condition is: supx(z) <= infx(x)
This is the same as the E case.

For x being S of z:
One of the conditions is: supy(x) <= infy(z)
This is the same as the SE case.

Another condition is: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
From the given conditions: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x)
This gives us: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), meaning infx(z) <= infx(x).
But for supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have a direct constraint from the given conditions.

For x being N of z:
One of the conditions is: supy(z) <= infy(x)
This is the same as the NE case.

Another condition is: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
This is the same as the S case.

For x being B of z:
The conditions are: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
From the above analyses, we can't derive all of these from the given constraints.

It's sounding more and more like I need to rely on the scenario examples to prove when a relationship is possible.

Based on the concrete scenarios I've constructed, and the constraints and defenses, I can conclude:

x can be E of z. (Shown in Scenario 2) 
x can be NE of z. (Shown in Scenario 1)
x can be SE of z. (Shown in Scenario 3)
x can be S of z. (Shown in Scenario 4)
x can be N of z. (Shown in Scenario 5)
x can be B of z. (Shown in Scenario 6)

OK, I think I've definitely fully answered the question. The possible relations between x and z are E, NE, SE, S, N, and B.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is N of z

Let me analyze what cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z. I'll check each possibility systematically.

The possible relations are:

**E (East)**: 
Region x can be to the east of z, with their y-projections overlapping.

**NE (Northeast)**:
Region x can be to the northeast of z (both east and north).

**SE (Southeast)**:
Region x can be to the southeast of z (both east and south).

**S (South)**:
Region x can be south of z, with their x-projections overlapping.

**N (North)**:
Region x can be to the north of z, with their x-projections overlapping.

**B (Bounding box)**:
Region x can be inside the bounding box of z.

The answer is: E, NE, SE, S, N, B
