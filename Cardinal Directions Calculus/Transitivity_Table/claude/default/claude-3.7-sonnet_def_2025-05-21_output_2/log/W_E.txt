PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step-by-step:

We know:
1. Region x is West (W) of region y
2. Region y is East (E) of region z

Let's recall the definitions:
- x W y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, I need to determine what these relations imply about the possible relationship between x and z.

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)  [x is to the left of y]
- infy(y) <= infy(x)  [x doesn't extend below y]
- supy(x) <= supy(y)  [x doesn't extend above y]

From y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)  [z is to the left of y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  [z doesn't extend below y]
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  [z doesn't extend above y]

Now let's determine what constraints these place on the relationship between x and z.

First, for the x-coordinates:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)  [from x W y]
- supx(z) <= infx(y)  [from y E z]

These don't directly give us a constraint between supx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(z) and infx(x). So based on the x-coordinates alone, x and z could be in various relations.

For the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)  [from x W y]
- supy(x) <= supy(y)  [from x W y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  [from y E z]
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  [from y E z]

Combining these:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [z's bottom is below or equal to x's bottom]
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) [x's top is below or equal to z's top]

So, in terms of y-coordinates, x is "contained" within the vertical extent of z.

Now, let's consider all possible relationships between x and z based on their x-coordinates.

Case 1: supx(x) <= infx(z)
This means x is completely to the left of z on the x-axis.
Given the y-coordinate constraints we derived, this would make x in the W relation to z.

Case 2: supx(z) <= infx(x)
This means z is completely to the left of x on the x-axis.
Given the y-coordinate constraints, this would make x in the E relation to z.

Case 3: There's overlap on the x-axis.
This gets a bit more complex, but given the y-coordinate constraints, x could be in relations like NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, or SE with respect to z, depending on the specific overlap.

Wait, I think I made an error in my analysis. Let me re-evaluate.

We know:
1. x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

From the x-coordinates:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) [from x W y]
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [from y E z]

This means both x and z are to the left of y on the x-axis, but there's no direct constraint between x and z on the x-axis.

From the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) [from x W y]
- supy(x) <= supy(y) [from x W y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [from y E z]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [from y E z]

Combining these:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

But I need to be careful here. These inequalities tell us:
- z's bottom is below or equal to y's bottom, and y's bottom is below or equal to x's bottom.
- x's top is below or equal to y's top, and y's top is below or equal to z's top.

This means x's vertical extent is "contained" within z's vertical extent, with x potentially shifted upwards compared to z.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships on the x-axis:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the left of z, which could make x in the W, NW, or SW relation to z depending on the y-coordinates.

2. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then z is to the left of x, which could make x in the E, NE, or SE relation to z.

3. If there's an overlap on the x-axis, then the relation could be N, S, or B.

I've established that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). These inequalities mean that x's bottom is above or at the same level as z's bottom, and x's top is below or at the same level as z's top. So, x can't be entirely above z or entirely below z. Given these constraints, let's refine the possible relations:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), with the y-constraints, x could be in the W relation to z.
2. If supx(z) <= infx(x), with the y-constraints, x could be in the E relation to z.
3. If there's an overlap on the x-axis, with the y-constraints, the relation could be B (if the overlap is significant).

But I'm struggling a bit with the visualization. Let me double-check if there are any other possible relations.

Hmm, wait a minute, our x constraint isn't between x and z directly, but we know that both x and z are to the left of y. So they could be in various positions relative to each other on the x-axis.

Let's revisit this with a clearer visualization. We have:

From the x-coordinates:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) [x is to the left of y]
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [z is to the left of y]

This means both x and z are to the left of y on the x-axis, but their relative positions to each other on the x-axis can vary.

From the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) [x doesn't extend below y]
- supy(x) <= supy(y) [x doesn't extend above y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [z doesn't extend below y]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [z doesn't extend above y]

Let's combine these to understand the constraints on the relative positions of x and z.

Actually, I think we have a mistake. Let me re-check the definitions:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Given:
1. x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From the x-coordinates:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) [x is to the left of y]
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [z is to the left of y]

So both x and z are to the left of y on the x-axis.

From the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) [x's bottom is above or equal to y's bottom]
- supy(x) <= supy(y) [x's top is below or equal to y's top]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [z's bottom is below or equal to y's bottom]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [z's top is above or equal to y's top]

Combining:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x's bottom is above or equal to z's bottom]
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) [x's top is below or equal to z's top]

So, in terms of the y-coordinates, x is "contained" within the vertical extent of z, with x potentially shifted upwards compared to z.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships based on the x-coordinates:

Let's denote the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of a region a as xmin(a) and xmax(a) respectively, and similarly for y.

We know:
- xmax(x) <= xmin(y) [x is to the left of y]
- xmax(z) <= xmin(y) [z is to the left of y]

So, the possible scenarios are:
1. xmax(x) <= xmin(z): This means x is to the left of z. Combined with the y-constraints, this would make x in the W relation to z.
2. xmax(z) <= xmin(x): This means z is to the left of x. Combined with the y-constraints, this would make x in the E relation to z.
3. There's an overlap on the x-axis: This means neither x is entirely to the left of z nor z is entirely to the left of x. Combined with the y-constraints, this could result in various relations.

The y-constraints (ymin(z) <= ymin(y) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(y) <= ymax(z)) mean that x's vertical extent is "contained" within z's vertical extent. This rules out relations where x is entirely above or entirely below z. But there could still be a partial vertical overlap.

Given the constraints, the possible relations are:
1. W: If x is to the left of z and there's a vertical overlap.
2. E: If z is to the left of x and there's a vertical overlap.
3. B: If there's both a horizontal and vertical overlap significant enough.

But I'm still trying to ensure I haven't missed any other possible relations, given the constraints.

Actually, I just realized I've been confusing infy and supy with min and max in y. Let me be more precise:

infy(a) is the greatest lower bound of region a's projection on the y-axis (i.e., the minimum y-coordinate).
supy(a) is the least upper bound of region a's projection on the y-axis (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate).

Similarly for the x-axis.

So the constraints:
- infy(y) <= infy(x): y's minimum y-coordinate is less than or equal to x's minimum y-coordinate.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): x's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to y's maximum y-coordinate.
- infy(z) <= infy(y): z's minimum y-coordinate is less than or equal to y's minimum y-coordinate.
- supy(y) <= supy(z): y's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to z's maximum y-coordinate.

Combining:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x): z has the smallest minimum y-coordinate, then y, then x.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z): x has the smallest maximum y-coordinate, then y, then z.

This means:
- x can't be entirely below z (since infy(x) >= infy(z)).
- x can't be entirely above z (since supy(x) <= supy(z)).

So x can be partially overlapping with z in the y-direction, or it can be completely contained within z's vertical extent.

Let's consider the possible cardinal relations:

1. NW: No, because for the NW relation, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts our constraint that supy(x) <= supy(z).
2. N: No, for the same reason as NW.
3. NE: No, for the same reason as NW.
4. W: Possible if xmax(x) <= xmin(z) and there's an appropriate vertical relationship.
5. B: Possible if there's both a horizontal and vertical overlap.
6. E: Possible if xmax(z) <= xmin(x) and there's an appropriate vertical relationship.
7. SW: No, because for the SW relation, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts our constraint that infy(z) <= infy(x).
8. S: No, for the same reason as SW.
9. SE: No, for the same reason as SW.

Given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z appear to be W, B, or E. But let me double-check this.

Wait, there's a subtlety here. The constraints infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) don't necessarily mean that x and z have a vertical overlap. It's possible that infy(x) = supy(z), which would mean that x's bottom edge touches z's top edge. In this case, the relation could be NW or NE (depending on the x-coordinates).

Similarly, if supy(x) = infy(z), then x's top edge touches z's bottom edge, and the relation could be SW or SE.

So, the possible relations could be W, NW, B, E, NE, SW, or SE. But I think I'm making a mistake somewhere because that list seems to be growing rather than narrowing down.

Let me check again using the definition of cardinal directions:

1. NW: x NW z iff xmax(x) <= xmin(z) and ymax(z) <= ymin(x).
2. N: x N z iff ymax(z) <= ymin(x), xmin(z) <= xmin(x) and xmax(x) <= xmax(z).
3. NE: x NE z iff xmax(z) <= xmin(x) and ymax(z) <= ymin(x).
4. W: x W z iff xmax(x) <= xmin(z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z).
5. B: x B z iff xmin(z) <= xmin(x), xmax(x) <= xmax(z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z).
6. E: x E z iff xmax(z) <= xmin(x), ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z).
7. SW: x SW z iff xmax(x) <= xmin(z) and ymax(x) <= ymin(z).
8. S: x S z iff ymax(x) <= ymin(z), xmin(z) <= xmin(x) and xmax(x) <= xmax(z).
9. SE: x SE z iff xmax(z) <= xmin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymin(z).

Given our constraints:
- xmax(x) <= xmin(y) [x is to the left of y]
- xmax(z) <= xmin(y) [z is to the left of y]
- ymin(y) <= ymin(x) [y's bottom is below or equal to x's bottom]
- ymax(x) <= ymax(y) [x's top is below or equal to y's top]
- ymin(z) <= ymin(y) [z's bottom is below or equal to y's bottom]
- ymax(y) <= ymax(z) [y's top is below or equal to z's top]

From these, we infer:
- ymin(z) <= ymin(y) <= ymin(x) [z's bottom is the lowest, then y's, then x's]
- ymax(x) <= ymax(y) <= ymax(z) [x's top is the lowest, then y's, then z's]

Let's check each cardinal relation:

1. NW: We would need ymax(z) <= ymin(x). But from our constraints, ymin(x) >= ymin(z) and ymax(z) >= ymax(x), so it's possible that ymax(z) > ymin(x). Thus, NW is not guaranteed.

2. N: We would need ymax(z) <= ymin(x). But from our constraints, ymin(x) >= ymin(z) and ymax(z) >= ymax(x), so it's possible that ymax(z) > ymin(x). Thus, N is not guaranteed.

3. NE: We would need ymax(z) <= ymin(x). But from our constraints, ymin(x) >= ymin(z) and ymax(z) >= ymax(x), so it's possible that ymax(z) > ymin(x). Thus, NE is not guaranteed.

4. W: We would need xmax(x) <= xmin(z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z). The last two conditions are satisfied by our constraints. The first condition is possible, so W is a possible relation.

5. B: We would need xmin(z) <= xmin(x), xmax(x) <= xmax(z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z). The last two conditions are satisfied by our constraints. The first two conditions are possible, so B is a possible relation.

6. E: We would need xmax(z) <= xmin(x), ymin(z) <= ymin(x), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z). The last two conditions are satisfied by our constraints. The first condition is possible, so E is a possible relation.

7. SW: We would need xmax(x) <= xmin(z) and ymax(x) <= ymin(z). The first condition is possible. For the second condition, from our constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z). This doesn't rule out ymax(x) <= ymin(z), so SW is a possible relation.

8. S: We would need ymax(x) <= ymin(z), xmin(z) <= xmin(x), and xmax(x) <= xmax(z). For the first condition, from our constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z). This doesn't rule out ymax(x) <= ymin(z), so the first condition is possible. The second and third conditions are also possible. Thus, S is a possible relation.

9. SE: We would need xmax(z) <= xmin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymin(z). Both conditions are possible given our constraints, so SE is a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are W, B, E, SW, S, SE.

I just realized I'm making a conceptual error and working with inequalities imprecisely. Let's take a more structured approach:

The constraints we're given are:
- xmax(x) <= xmin(y) [x is to the left of y]
- xmax(z) <= xmin(y) [z is to the left of y]
- ymin(y) <= ymin(x) [y's bottom is below or equal to x's bottom]
- ymax(x) <= ymax(y) [x's top is below or equal to y's top]
- ymin(z) <= ymin(y) [z's bottom is below or equal to y's bottom]
- ymax(y) <= ymax(z) [y's top is below or equal to z's top]

From these, we can infer:
- ymin(z) <= ymin(y) <= ymin(x) [z's bottom is the lowest, then y's, then x's]
- ymax(x) <= ymax(y) <= ymax(z) [x's top is the lowest, then y's, then z's]

These constraints don't directly tell us about the relationship between xmin(x) and xmin(z), or between xmax(x) and xmax(z). Both x and z are to the left of y, but we don't know their relative positions on the x-axis.

Let's use the cardinal direction definitions directly:

1. NW: We need xmax(x) <= xmin(z) (x is to the left of z) and ymax(z) <= ymin(x) (x is above z). From the constraints ymin(z) <= ymin(y) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(y) <= ymax(z), we can infer that ymin(x) <= ymax(z). This means that x is not above z. So, the NW relation is not possible.

2. N: We need ymax(z) <= ymin(x) (x is above z). But from the constraints, ymin(x) <= ymax(z), so x is not above z. N is not possible.

3. NE: We need xmax(z) <= xmin(x) (x is to the right of z) and ymax(z) <= ymin(x) (x is above z). But from the constraints, ymin(x) <= ymax(z), so x is not above z. NE is not possible.

4. W: We need xmax(x) <= xmin(z) (x is to the left of z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x) (z's bottom is below or equal to x's bottom), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z) (x's top is below or equal to z's top). The last two conditions are satisfied by our constraints. The first condition is possible, so W is a possible relation.

5. B: We need xmin(z) <= xmin(x), xmax(x) <= xmax(z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z). The last two conditions are satisfied by our constraints. The first two conditions are possible, so B is a possible relation.

6. E: We need xmax(z) <= xmin(x) (x is to the right of z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x) (z's bottom is below or equal to x's bottom), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z) (x's top is below or equal to z's top). The last two conditions are satisfied by our constraints. The first condition is possible, so E is a possible relation.

7. SW: We need xmax(x) <= xmin(z) (x is to the left of z) and ymax(x) <= ymin(z) (x is below z). The first condition is possible. For the second condition, from the constraints ymin(z) <= ymin(y) <= ymin(x), we infer that ymin(z) <= ymin(x). This means that x is not below z. So, the SW relation is not possible.

8. S: We need ymax(x) <= ymin(z) (x is below z). But from the constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x), so x is not below z. S is not possible.

9. SE: We need xmax(z) <= xmin(x) (x is to the right of z) and ymax(x) <= ymin(z) (x is below z). The first condition is possible. For the second condition, from the constraints ymin(z) <= ymin(y) <= ymin(x), we infer that ymin(z) <= ymin(x). This means that x is not below z. So, the SE relation is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are W, B, E.

Actually, I feel like I'm going in circles. Let me take a step back.

Our constraints are:
1. Region x is W of region y: xmax(x) <= xmin(y), ymin(y) <= ymin(x), ymax(x) <= ymax(y)
2. Region y is E of region z: xmax(z) <= xmin(y), ymin(z) <= ymin(y), ymax(y) <= ymax(z)

From these, we know that both x and z are to the left of y on the x-axis, and y is "vertically contained" between z's bottom and top, and x is "vertically contained" between y's bottom and top.

Let's reason about the possible relations between x and z:

For the x-axis:
- Both x and z are to the left of y, but we don't know their relative positions. xmax(x) could be less than, equal to, or greater than xmax(z).
- If xmax(x) < xmin(z), then x is completely to the left of z.
- If xmax(z) < xmin(x), then z is completely to the left of x.
- Otherwise, there's an overlap on the x-axis.

For the y-axis, from our constraints:
- ymin(z) <= ymin(y) <= ymin(x): z has the lowest bottom, then y, then x.
- ymax(x) <= ymax(y) <= ymax(z): x has the lowest top, then y, then z.

This means that z "contains" y in the vertical direction, and y "contains" x in the vertical direction. Transitively, z "contains" x in the vertical direction.

Given these constraints, let's go through the cardinal relations systematically:

1. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need xmax(x) <= xmin(z) (x is to the left of z) and ymax(z) <= ymin(x) (x is above z). From our y-axis constraints, ymin(x) <= ymax(z), which means that x is not completely above z. So, the NW relation is not possible.

2. N: For x to be N of z, we need ymax(z) <= ymin(x) (x is above z). But from our y-axis constraints, ymin(x) <= ymax(z), which means that x is not completely above z. So, the N relation is not possible.

3. NE: For x to be NE of z, we need xmax(z) <= xmin(x) (x is to the right of z) and ymax(z) <= ymin(x) (x is above z). From our y-axis constraints, ymin(x) <= ymax(z), which means that x is not completely above z. So, the NE relation is not possible.

4. W: For x to be W of z, we need xmax(x) <= xmin(z) (x is to the left of z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x) (z's bottom is below or equal to x's bottom), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z) (x's top is below or equal to z's top). From our y-axis constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied. The x-condition is possible, so W is a possible relation.

5. B: For x to be B of z, we need xmin(z) <= xmin(x), xmax(x) <= xmax(z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z). From our y-axis constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied. The x-conditions are possible, so B is a possible relation.

6. E: For x to be E of z, we need xmax(z) <= xmin(x) (x is to the right of z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x) (z's bottom is below or equal to x's bottom), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z) (x's top is below or equal to z's top). From our y-axis constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied. The x-condition is possible, so E is a possible relation.

7. SW: For x to be SW of z, we need xmax(x) <= xmin(z) (x is to the left of z) and ymax(x) <= ymin(z) (x is below z). From our y-axis constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x), which means ymin(z) <= ymax(x) (since ymin(x) <= ymax(x)), and so x is not completely below z. So, the SW relation is not possible.

8. S: For x to be S of z, we need ymax(x) <= ymin(z) (x is below z). But from our y-axis constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x), which means ymin(z) <= ymax(x) (since ymin(x) <= ymax(x)), and so x is not completely below z. So, the S relation is not possible.

9. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need xmax(z) <= xmin(x) (x is to the right of z) and ymax(x) <= ymin(z) (x is below z). From our y-axis constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x), which means ymin(z) <= ymax(x) (since ymin(x) <= ymax(x)), and so x is not completely below z. So, the SE relation is not possible.

So, based on the given constraints, the possible cardinal relations between x and z are W, B, E.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if my interpretation of the y-constraints is correct. Let me reason through the constraints one more time.

The constraints on the y-axis are:
1. ymin(y) <= ymin(x): y's bottom is at or below x's bottom.
2. ymax(x) <= ymax(y): x's top is at or below y's top.
3. ymin(z) <= ymin(y): z's bottom is at or below y's bottom.
4. ymax(y) <= ymax(z): y's top is at or below z's top.

From 1 and 3, we get ymin(z) <= ymin(y) <= ymin(x), so z's bottom is at or below x's bottom.
From 2 and 4, we get ymax(x) <= ymax(y) <= ymax(z), so x's top is at or below z's top.

These constraints mean that z's vertical extent has its bottom below or at the same level as x's bottom, and its top above or at the same level as x's top. In other words, z's vertical extent "contains" x's vertical extent.

Now, let's check the cardinal relations:

1. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need x's vertical extent to be above z's vertical extent. But our constraints tell us that z's vertical extent contains x's vertical extent. So, x can't be NW of z.

2. N: For x to be N of z, we need x's vertical extent to be above z's vertical extent. But our constraints tell us that z's vertical extent contains x's vertical extent. So, x can't be N of z.

3. NE: For x to be NE of z, we need x's vertical extent to be above z's vertical extent. But our constraints tell us that z's vertical extent contains x's vertical extent. So, x can't be NE of z.

4. W: For x to be W of z, we need x's horizontal extent to be to the left of z's horizontal extent, and there needs to be a vertical overlap. Our constraints ensure a vertical overlap. It's possible for x's horizontal extent to be to the left of z's, so W is a possible relation.

5. B: For x to be B of z, we need x's horizontal and vertical extents to be contained within z's respective extents. Our constraints ensure that x's vertical extent is contained within z's. It's possible for x's horizontal extent to be contained within z's, so B is a possible relation.

6. E: For x to be E of z, we need x's horizontal extent to be to the right of z's horizontal extent, and there needs to be a vertical overlap. Our constraints ensure a vertical overlap. It's possible for x's horizontal extent to be to the right of z's, so E is a possible relation.

7. SW: For x to be SW of z, we need x's vertical extent to be below z's vertical extent. But our constraints tell us that z's vertical extent contains x's vertical extent. So, x can't be SW of z.

8. S: For x to be S of z, we need x's vertical extent to be below z's vertical extent. But our constraints tell us that z's vertical extent contains x's vertical extent. So, x can't be S of z.

9. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need x's vertical extent to be below z's vertical extent. But our constraints tell us that z's vertical extent contains x's vertical extent. So, x can't be SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are W, B, E.

I'm pretty confident of this, but I just do one more final check. The cardinal relations that involve vertical containment are W, B, and E. The northern (NW, N, NE) and southern (SW, S, SE) relations require one region to be above or below the other, which isn't the case here.

So, given the constraints that region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are W, B, E.

Actually, on second thought I'm being overly restrictive. Let's make sure that my reasoning about vertical containment is correct.

From our constraints, we know that ymin(z) <= ymin(y) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(y) <= ymax(z). This tells us that z's bottom is at or below x's bottom, and z's top is at or above x's top. In other words, z's vertical extent contains x's vertical extent.

But vertical containment doesn't necessarily mean that x and z must overlap vertically. It's still possible that ymin(x) = ymax(z), which means x's bottom edge touches z's top edge. Similarly, it's possible that ymax(x) = ymin(z), which means x's top edge touches z's bottom edge.

Actually, wait, there's a logical error there. If ymin(z) <= ymin(x) (z's bottom is below or at the same height as x's bottom) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z) (x's top is below or at the same height as z's top), then it's not possible for ymin(x) > ymax(z) or ymax(x) < ymin(z), which would be the conditions for no vertical overlap. So, based on our constraints, there must be a vertical overlap between x and z.

Now, let's check the cardinal relations:

1. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need xmax(x) <= xmin(z) (x is to the left of z) and ymax(z) <= ymin(x) (x is above z). From our y-constraints, ymin(x) <= ymax(z), which is the opposite of what we need. So, x can't be NW of z.

2. N: For x to be N of z, we need ymax(z) <= ymin(x) (x is above z). From our y-constraints, ymin(x) <= ymax(z), which is the opposite of what we need. So, x can't be N of z.

3. NE: For x to be NE of z, we need xmax(z) <= xmin(x) (x is to the right of z) and ymax(z) <= ymin(x) (x is above z). From our y-constraints, ymin(x) <= ymax(z), which is the opposite of what we need. So, x can't be NE of z.

4. W: For x to be W of z, we need xmax(x) <= xmin(z) (x is to the left of z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x) (z's bottom is below or at the same height as x's bottom), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z) (x's top is below or at the same height as z's top). From our y-constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied. The x-condition is possible, so W is a possible relation.

5. B: For x to be B of z, we need xmin(z) <= xmin(x), xmax(x) <= xmax(z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z). From our y-constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied. The x-conditions are possible, so B is a possible relation.

6. E: For x to be E of z, we need xmax(z) <= xmin(x) (x is to the right of z), ymin(z) <= ymin(x) (z's bottom is below or at the same height as x's bottom), and ymax(x) <= ymax(z) (x's top is below or at the same height as z's top). From our y-constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x) and ymax(x) <= ymax(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied. The x-condition is possible, so E is a possible relation.

7. SW: For x to be SW of z, we need xmax(x) <= xmin(z) (x is to the left of z) and ymax(x) <= ymin(z) (x is below z). From our y-constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x), which means ymin(z) <= ymax(x) (since ymin(x) <= ymax(x)), and so the condition ymax(x) <= ymin(z) cannot be satisfied. So, x can't be SW of z.

8. S: For x to be S of z, we need ymax(x) <= ymin(z) (x is below z). From our y-constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x), which means ymin(z) <= ymax(x) (since ymin(x) <= ymax(x)), and so the condition ymax(x) <= ymin(z) cannot be satisfied. So, x can't be S of z.

9. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need xmax(z) <= xmin(x) (x is to the right of z) and ymax(x) <= ymin(z) (x is below z). From our y-constraints, ymin(z) <= ymin(x), which means ymin(z) <= ymax(x) (since ymin(x) <= ymax(x)), and so the condition ymax(x) <= ymin(z) cannot be satisfied. So, x can't be SE of z.

So, based on our constraints, the possible relations between x and z are W, B, E. That is, x can be to the left of z (W), contained within z (B), or to the right of z (E).

This seems correct, because the constraints on the y-axis ensure that x and z overlap vertically, but they don't give any specific information about the x-axis relationship.

So, in summary, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
1. W (West): If region x is to the left of region z.
2. B (Bounding box): If region x is contained within the horizontal bounds of region z.
3. E (East): If region x is to the right of region z.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions and given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is E of region z

From the definition of W relation:
x W y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From the definition of E relation:
y E z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- Both x and z are to the left of y on the x-axis (but we don't know their relative positions)
- For the y-coordinates: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means z's vertical extent "contains" x's vertical extent (z has a lower bottom and a higher top than x).

Checking each possible relation:
- N, NE, NW relations require x to be above z, which contradicts our constraints
- S, SE, SW relations require x to be below z, which contradicts our constraints
- W relation is possible if x is to the left of z
- E relation is possible if x is to the right of z
- B relation is possible if x is contained within z's horizontal extent

The possible relations are: W, B, E
