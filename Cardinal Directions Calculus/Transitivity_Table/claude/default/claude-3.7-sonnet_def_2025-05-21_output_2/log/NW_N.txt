PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step.

We know that:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of the cardinal directions:

For NW (North West): a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
This means that region a is entirely to the left and above region b.

For N (North): a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
This means that region a is entirely above region b, and the x-projection of a is contained within the x-projection of b.

Now, let's apply these definitions to our scenario:

Region x is NW of region y, so:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) [x is entirely to the left of y]
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is entirely above y]

Region y is N of region z, so:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is entirely above z]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) [the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z]

Now, let's determine the relation between region x and region z:

For the y-coordinate (vertical):
- We know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
- By transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This means that region x is entirely above region z, which is consistent with N, NW, or NE relation.

For the x-coordinate (horizontal):
- We know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
- This means that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but we can't directly infer the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) or between the other bounds.

Let's consider the possible cases:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then region x is entirely to the left of region z. Combined with the fact that region x is entirely above region z, the relation would be NW.

2. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then the x-projection of region x is contained within the x-projection of region z. Combined with the fact that region x is entirely above region z, the relation would be N.

3. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then region x is entirely to the right of region z. Combined with the fact that region x is entirely above region z, the relation would be NE.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW, N, and NE.

Let me double-check by considering some concrete examples:

Example 1: 
- Region x: A square at coordinates (0, 3) to (1, 4)
- Region y: A square at coordinates (2, 1) to (3, 2)
- Region z: A square at coordinates (1, -1) to (4, 0)

In this example:
- Region x is NW of region y because x is entirely to the left and above y.
- Region y is N of region z because y is entirely above z and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.
- Region x is NW of region z because x is entirely to the left and above z.

Example 2:
- Region x: A square at coordinates (2, 3) to (3, 4)
- Region y: A square at coordinates (2, 1) to (3, 2)
- Region z: A square at coordinates (1, -1) to (4, 0)

In this example:
- Region x is N of region y because x is entirely above y and they have the same x-projection.
- Region y is N of region z because y is entirely above z and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.
- Region x is N of region z because x is entirely above z and the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.

Example 3:
- Region x: A square at coordinates (4, 3) to (5, 4)
- Region y: A square at coordinates (2, 1) to (3, 2)
- Region z: A square at coordinates (1, -1) to (4, 0)

In this example:
- Region x is NE of region y because x is entirely to the right and above y.
- Region y is N of region z because y is entirely above z and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.
- Region x is NE of region z because x is entirely to the right and above z.

Wait, let me think about this more carefully. For x to be NW of y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

For y to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's try to derive the relationship between x and z:

From x is NW of y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) [1]
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [2]

From y is N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [3]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [4]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [5]

For the vertical relationship:
From [2] and [3], we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which is supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is always above z, which is consistent with N, NW, or NE.

For the horizontal relationship:
From [1] and [4], we get supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). However, we can't directly infer the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

Let's consider the possible cases:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is entirely to the left of z. Combined with the vertical relationship, the relation is NW.

2. If infx(z) <= supx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and also infx(z) <= infx(x), then the x-projection of x partially overlaps with the x-projection of z, but not completely to the right. This doesn't fit any of the cardinal directions.

   Actually, let me think about this more carefully. For region x to be N of region z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) [this we have]
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) [this we're not sure about]

   From [4], we have infx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't know the relationship between infx(y) and infx(x).
   From [1], we have supx(x) <= infx(y), but that doesn't help us directly.

   So we can't say for sure if x can be N of z based on the given conditions.

3. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is entirely to the right of z. Combined with the vertical relationship, the relation is NE.

4. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. Combined with the vertical relationship, the relation is N.

Wait, I think I've been approaching this incorrectly. Let me try a different approach.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

For x to be NW of y, x is entirely above and to the left of y.
For y to be N of z, y is entirely above z, and the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z.

Now, for the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Since x is above y, and y is above z, by transitivity, x is above z. This means x is either NW, N, or NE of z.

2. Since x is to the left of y, and the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z, there's a possibility that x is to the left of z, or x might have some overlap with z in the x-direction.

Let me think of it more concretely:

For x to be NW of y:
- x is entirely to the left of y
- x is entirely above y

For y to be N of z:
- y is entirely above z
- the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z

Given these, x is definitely above z. For the horizontal relationship, since x is to the left of y and y's x-projection is within z's x-projection, x can be:
- Entirely to the left of z (which would make x NW of z)
- Partially overlapping with z in the x-direction, but still to the left of some part of z (which might make x N of z, depending on the extent of overlap)
- Entirely within the x-projection of z (which would make x N of z)

So, the possible relationships between x and z are NW and N.

Let me consider an example to check:

Example:
- Region x has coordinates (0, 4) to (2, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (2, 0) to (6, 1)

In this example:
- x is NW of y
- y is N of z
- x is NW of z

But what if:
- Region x has coordinates (2.5, 4) to (4.5, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (2, 0) to (6, 1)

In this example:
- x is NW of y (since supx(x) = 4.5 < infx(y) = 3)
  Hmm, that's not true. Let me fix this example.

Let's try again:
- Region x has coordinates (0, 4) to (2, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (1, 0) to (7, 1)

Now:
- x is NW of y because x is entirely to the left and above y.
- y is N of z because y is entirely above z and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.
- x is NW of z because x is entirely to the left and above z.

Let's try another example:
- Region x has coordinates (2, 4) to (4, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (1, 0) to (7, 1)

Now:
- x is NW of y because... wait, x is not entirely to the left of y. In fact, x and y overlap in the x-direction. So x is not NW of y.

Let me correct this:
- Region x has coordinates (1, 4) to (2, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (1, 0) to (7, 1)

Now:
- x is NW of y because x is entirely to the left and above y.
- y is N of z because y is entirely above z and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.
- x overlaps with z in the x-direction, so x is not NW of z. But x is entirely above z, so x is N of z.

Actually, I'm confusing myself. Let me go back to the definitions and be more methodical:

For x to be NW of y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) [x is entirely to the left of y]
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is entirely above y]

For y to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is entirely above z]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) [the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z]

Now, let's derive what we can about the relationship between x and z:

For the vertical relationship:
From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y), by transitivity, we have supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is entirely above z, which is consistent with N, NW, or NE.

For the horizontal relationship:
From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). But the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) is not determined.

Let's consider the possible cases for the horizontal relationship:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is entirely to the left of z. Combined with the vertical relationship, the relation is NW.

2. If infx(z) <= supx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then the x-projection of x overlaps with the x-projection of z. This, combined with the vertical relationship, doesn't necessarily fit any of the cardinal directions. But if the x-projection of x is completely within the x-projection of z, i.e., if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then the relation is N.

3. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is entirely to the right of z. Combined with the vertical relationship, the relation is NE.

4. Actually, for N, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) [the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z]. Let's see if this is consistent with the given conditions.
   
   Actually, I'm getting confused again. For N, we need the primary region to be entirely above the reference region. If x is N of z, then x is entirely above z, which we've established is true.

   For x to be N of z, we also need the x-projection of x to be within the x-projection of z, i.e., infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

   From the conditions, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). Also, supx(y) <= supx(z). But we can't derive a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z), or between supx(x) and supx(z).

Hmm, let me approach this differently. The definition of "a N b" is that a is entirely above b and the x-projection of a is contained within the x-projection of b. For "a NW b", a is entirely above and to the left of b.

Given that x is NW of y, we know:
- x is entirely to the left of y: supx(x) <= infx(y)
- x is entirely above y: supy(y) <= infy(x)

Given that y is N of z, we know:
- y is entirely above z: supy(z) <= infy(y)
- y's x-projection is within z's x-projection: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, for the relationship between x and z:
- From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y), by transitivity, we get supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is entirely above z. This is consistent with the relations N, NW, and NE.

- For the horizontal relationship, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). There are several possibilities:

  1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is entirely to the left of z. Combined with x being entirely above z, the relation is NW.

  2. If infx(z) <= supx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x), then the x-projection of z overlaps with the x-projection of x. If further, the x-projection of x is entirely within the x-projection of z (i.e., infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)), then the relation is N.

  3. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is entirely to the right of z. Combined with x being entirely above z, the relation is NE.

Actually, as I've just analyzed, the horizontal relationship between x and z can't be conclusively determined. This is because we know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't have a direct relationship between x and z.

Let's reconsider. Given the constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) [from x NW y]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [from y N z]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [from y N z]

We can have the following scenarios for the horizontal relationship between x and z:

1. supx(x) <= infx(z): This makes x entirely to the left of z, which corresponds to a NW relation.

2. infx(z) <= supx(x) and also infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): This means the x-projection of x overlaps with or is contained within the x-projection of z. If the x-projection of x is entirely within the x-projection of z, then the relation is N.

3. supx(z) <= infx(x): This makes x entirely to the right of z, which corresponds to a NE relation.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, are NW, N, and NE.

Let me double-check this conclusion with a few more examples:

Example 1 (NW):
- Region x has coordinates (0, 4) to (2, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (3, 0) to (7, 1)

In this example:
- x is NW of y because x is entirely to the left and above y.
- y is N of z because y is entirely above z and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.
- x is NW of z because x is entirely to the left and above z.

Example 2 (N):
- Region x has coordinates (4, 4) to (6, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (3, 0) to (7, 1)

In this example:
- x is not entirely to the left of y, so x is not NW of y. This example doesn't satisfy the condition that x is NW of y.

Let me fix this example:
- Region x has coordinates (2, 4) to (2.5, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (2, 0) to (7, 1)

In this example:
- x is NW of y because x is entirely to the left and above y.
- y is N of z because y is entirely above z and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.
- x is not entirely to the left of z (because infx(z) = 2 <= supx(x) = 2.5), but x is entirely above z and the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. So, x is N of z.

Example 3 (NE):
- Region x has coordinates (8, 4) to (10, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (3, 0) to (7, 1)

In this example:
- x is not to the left of y, so x is not NW of y. This example doesn't satisfy the condition that x is NW of y.

Let me fix this example:
- Region x has coordinates (1, 4) to (2, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (0, 0) to (2, 1)

In this example:
- x is NW of y because x is entirely to the left and above y.
- y is N of z because... wait, y is not entirely above z and the x-projection of y is not contained within the x-projection of z. So y is not N of z. This example doesn't work.

Let me try yet another example:
- Region x has coordinates (6, 4) to (8, 6)
- Region y has coordinates (3, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z has coordinates (0, 0) to (4, 1)

In this example:
- x is not to the left of y, so x is not NW of y. This example doesn't satisfy the condition that x is NW of y.

I'm having trouble constructing an example where x is NW of y, y is N of z, and x is NE of z. Let me think a bit more.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. Let's recall the definitions:

For a NW b: supx(a) <= infx(b) [a is entirely to the left of b] and supy(b) <= infy(a) [a is entirely above b]
For a N b: supy(b) <= infy(a) [a is entirely above b] and infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) [the x-projection of a is contained within the x-projection of b]

Given that x is NW of y and y is N of z, let's derive what we can:

For x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) [x is entirely to the left of y]
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is entirely above y]

For y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is entirely above z]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) [the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z]

For the vertical relationship between x and z:
From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y), by transitivity, we get supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is entirely above z, which is consistent with N, NW, and NE.

For the horizontal relationship between x and z:
From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)

From these, we can derive that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).

Consider the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z):
If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is entirely to the left of z, which, combined with the vertical relationship, is consistent with NW.
If infx(z) <= supx(x), then the projections of x and z on the x-axis overlap, or x is to the right of z.

Let's check if x can be N of z:
For x to be N of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But from the conditions, we only know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which doesn't allow us to derive the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z). So, based on the given conditions, we can't determine if x can be N of z.

Also, going back to the conditions, from supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can't determine if supx(x) <= infx(z) or infx(z) <= supx(x). This means we can't determine for sure if x is entirely to the left of z.

Let's check if x can be NE of z:
For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is entirely to the right of z]. But from the conditions, we don't have any relationship involving supx(z), so we can't determine if x can be NE of z.

So, it seems that we can't determine the exact horizontal relationship between x and z based on the given conditions. The only thing we can say for sure is that x is entirely above z.

Actually, let me think more about this. Can x be NE of z given the conditions? For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). We know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). 

From these, can we derive a relationship between supx(z) and infx(x)?

Let's consider a specific scenario: If supx(z) = infx(y) (i.e., the right edge of z aligns with the left edge of y), and supx(x) <= infx(y), then supx(z) <= infx(x) is not guaranteed because it depends on the relationship between infx(x) and supx(x). We know that for x to be NW of y, supx(x) <= infx(y). For x to be NE of z, supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(z) = infx(y), then we have supx(z) = infx(y) >= supx(x), which contradicts the condition for x to be NE of z.

So, x cannot be NE of z given the conditions. The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW and N.

Wait, I need to be more careful. Let's derive the constraints for each possible cardinal relation between x and z. Recall the definitions of the cardinal relations:

For x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
For x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
For x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know from the given conditions that:
- x is entirely above z: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) in addition to the vertical constraint.

For x to be N of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) in addition to the vertical constraint.

For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) in addition to the vertical constraint.

Let's check each of these:

NW: Can supx(x) <= infx(z) be true given the constraints? We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) is not determined. So, it's possible for x to be NW of z.

N: Can infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) be true given the constraints? From the constraints, we can't derive a direct relationship for these, so it's possible for x to be N of z.

NE: Can supx(z) <= infx(x) be true given the constraints? We know supx(y) <= supx(z) from y N z, and supx(x) <= infx(y) from x NW y. These values could be arranged such that supx(z) <= infx(x), but it's not guaranteed.

Hmm, let me approach this differently. Let's think about the physical arrangement of the regions.

Given that x is NW of y, x is to the left and above y.
Given that y is N of z, y is above z and the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z.

Since x is to the left of y, and y can be anywhere within the x-projection of z (as long as it's above z), the relationship between x and z can be:
- x is to the left of z (NW).
- x has some x-overlap with z, but its x-projection is completely within the x-projection of z (N).
- x has some x-overlap with z, but its x-projection is not completely within the x-projection of z (which doesn't fit into any of the cardinal directions).
- x is to the right of z (NE).

Wait, actually, I don't think x can be to the right of z in this scenario. Let's analyze:

For y to be N of z, the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z, which means supx(y) <= supx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y). For x to be NW of y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y). Now, for x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). 

If we combine these, we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
supx(z) <= infx(x) (for x to be NE of z)

From the first two, we can't derive a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). So, we can't say for sure if x can be NE of z or not.

Alright, I'm a little stuck again. Let's move forward by using actual examples and see if x can be NE of z:

Let's visualize:
- Region x: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (a, b) and top-right corner at (c, d).
- Region y: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (e, f) and top-right corner at (g, h).
- Region z: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (i, j) and top-right corner at (k, l).

For x to be NW of y:
- c <= e (x is to the left of y)
- h <= b (x is above y)

For y to be N of z:
- l <= f (y is above z)
- i <= e and g <= k (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

For x to be NE of z:
- k <= a (x is to the right of z)
- l <= b (x is above z)

Combining the constraints:
- c <= e (from x NW y)
- i <= e (from y N z)
- k <= a (for x to be NE of z)

Let's see if there's any contradiction here:
  c <= e
  i <= e
  k <= a

No obvious contradiction here. So, in theory, x can be NE of z. Let's see if we can construct a concrete example:

Set:
a = 10, b = 15, c = 12, d = 18 (for region x)
e = 15, f = 10, g = 18, h = 13 (for region y)
i = 5, j = 5, k = 20, l = 8 (for region z)

Checking the constraints:
- c = 12 <= e = 15 (x is to the left of y) ✓
- h = 13 <= b = 15 (x is above y) ✓
- l = 8 <= f = 10 (y is above z) ✓
- i = 5 <= e = 15 and g = 18 <= k = 20 (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection) ✓
- k = 20 <= a = 10 (x is to the right of z) ✗

This doesn't work because x is not to the right of z. Let's adjust the parameters:

Set:
a = 16, b = 15, c = 18, d = 18 (for region x)
e = 8, f = 10, g = 12, h = 13 (for region y)
i = 5, j = 5, k = 15, l = 8 (for region z)

Checking the constraints:
- c = 18 <= e = 8 (x is to the left of y) ✗

This doesn't work. Let's try again:

Set:
a = 16, b = 15, c = 18, d = 18 (for region x)
e = 20, f = 10, g = 25, h = 13 (for region y)
i = 5, j = 5, k = 15, l = 8 (for region z)

Checking the constraints:
- c = 18 <= e = 20 (x is to the left of y) ✓
- h = 13 <= b = 15 (x is above y) ✓
- l = 8 <= f = 10 (y is above z) ✓
- i = 5 <= e = 20 and g = 25 <= k = 15 (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection) ✗

This doesn't work because y's x-projection is not within z's x-projection. Let's try again:

Set:
a = 16, b = 15, c = 18, d = 18 (for region x)
e = 20, f = 10, g = 25, h = 13 (for region y)
i = 15, j = 5, k = 30, l = 8 (for region z)

Checking the constraints:
- c = 18 <= e = 20 (x is to the left of y) ✓
- h = 13 <= b = 15 (x is above y) ✓
- l = 8 <= f = 10 (y is above z) ✓
- i = 15 <= e = 20 and g = 25 <= k = 30 (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection) ✓
- k = 30 <= a = 16 (x is to the right of z) ✗

This doesn't work because x is not to the right of z. Let's try one more:

Let's try to set the constraints and see if we can solve the system:

c <= e
h <= b
l <= f
i <= e
g <= k
k <= a

But wait, these constraints seem circular. Let's reorder them:

c <= e
i <= e
k <= a
g <= k

This gives us:
c <= e
i <= e
a >= k >= g

If we set e > g, then from g <= k and k <= a, we get a >= k >= g > e, which would mean a > e. But then, from c <= e < a, we would have c < a, which contradicts the definition of region x (since c is the x-coordinate of the top-right and a is the x-coordinate of the bottom-left, so c > a). I realize I made a mistake: since (a, b) is the bottom-left and (c, d) is the top-right, we have a < c, so the constraint would indeed be c < a, which is a contradiction.

Let's try again, making sure the regions' coordinates are correctly defined with the bottom-left corner being (a, b) and the top-right corner being (c, d), and similarly for the other regions. I'll adjust my approach accordingly.

Define:
- Region x: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (xa, xb) and top-right corner at (xc, xd).
- Region y: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (ya, yb) and top-right corner at (yc, yd).
- Region z: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (za, zb) and top-right corner at (zc, zd).

For x to be NW of y:
- xc <= ya (x is to the left of y)
- yd <= xb (x is above y)

For y to be N of z:
- zd <= yb (y is above z)
- za <= ya and yc <= zc (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

For x to be NE of z:
- zc <= xa (x is to the right of z)
- zd <= xb (x is above z)

Combining the constraints:
- xc <= ya (from x NW y)
- za <= ya (from y N z)
- yc <= zc (from y N z)
- zc <= xa (for x to be NE of z)

Let's trace the chain: zc <= xa, but also xc <= ya, so zc <= xa < xc <= ya. But then, zc < ya, which conflicts with yc <= zc (from y N z) and za <= ya (from y N z). Because if yc <= zc < ya, then yc < ya, which would mean y's x-projection is flipped, which is invalid for a region.

This suggests that x can't be NE of z.

Actually, I want to double check my algebraic reasoning. Clearly there's a constraint that I'm missing or interpreting wrong, because the relationship needs to be NW, N, or NE, and I was only able to derive NW and N, but not NE.

Define:
- Region x: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (x₁, y₁) and top-right corner at (x₂, y₂).
- Region y: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (y₁, z₁) and top-right corner at (y₂, z₂).
- Region z: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (z₁, w₁) and top-right corner at (z₂, w₂).

For x to be NW of y:
- x₂ <= y₁ (x is to the left of y)
- z₂ <= y₁ (x is above y)

For y to be N of z:
- w₂ <= z₁ (y is above z)
- z₁ <= y₁ and y₂ <= z₂ (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

For x to be NE of z:
- z₂ <= x₁ (x is to the right of z)
- w₂ <= y₁ (x is above z)

Now, from x NW y, we know x₂ <= y₁. From y N z, we know z₁ <= y₁ and y₂ <= z₂. 

For x to be NE of z, we would need z₂ <= x₁. But from x NW y, we know x₂ <= y₁, so x₁ < x₂ <= y₁. Also, from y N z, we have y₂ <= z₂. 

If z₂ <= x₁, then combining with the earlier relations, we get y₂ <= z₂ <= x₁ < x₂ <= y₁. This would give us y₂ < y₁, which contradicts the definition of region y (since y₁ is the x-coordinate of the left edge and y₂ is the x-coordinate of the right edge, we should have y₁ < y₂).

So, it appears that x cannot be NE of z.

But wait, I just realized I'm confusing variable naming. Let me try once more with a clearer naming convention.

Define:
- Region x: Rectangle with left edge at x_l, right edge at x_r, bottom edge at x_b, and top edge at x_t.
- Region y: Rectangle with left edge at y_l, right edge at y_r, bottom edge at y_b, and top edge at y_t.
- Region z: Rectangle with left edge at z_l, right edge at z_r, bottom edge at z_b, and top edge at z_t.

For x to be NW of y:
- x_r <= y_l (x is to the left of y)
- y_t <= x_b (x is above y)

For y to be N of z:
- z_t <= y_b (y is above z)
- z_l <= y_l and y_r <= z_r (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

For x to be NE of z:
- z_r <= x_l (x is to the right of z)
- z_t <= x_b (x is above z)

Now, from x NW y, we know x_r <= y_l. From y N z, we know z_l <= y_l and y_r <= z_r. 

For x to be NE of z, we would need z_r <= x_l. But from x NW y, we know x_r <= y_l, which means x_l < x_r <= y_l. Also, from y N z, we have y_r <= z_r. 

Let's see: x_l < x_r <= y_l < y_r <= z_r. This gives us x_l < z_r, which contradicts the requirement for x to be NE of z, which is z_r <= x_l.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW and N only.

But I want to be 100% sure, so let me actually sketch these out on a 2D plane to make sure we can actually construct a valid configuration for each of NW and N, but not for NE.

For N: 
Let me place region z as a rectangle spanning from (0, 0) to (10, 1). 
Region y can be a rectangle spanning from (4, 2) to (6, 3), which is N of z.
Region x can be a rectangle spanning from (4, 4) to (6, 5), which is NW of y.
In this configuration, x is N of z.

For NW:
Let me place region z as a rectangle spanning from (5, 0) to (15, 1). 
Region y can be a rectangle spanning from (4, 2) to (6, 3), which is N of z.
Region x can be a rectangle spanning from (1, 4) to (3, 5), which is NW of y.
In this configuration, x is NW of z.

For NE:
Let me place region z as a rectangle spanning from (0, 0) to (5, 1). 
Region y could be a rectangle spanning from (2, 2) to (3, 3), which is N of z.
For region x to be NW of y and NE of z, x needs to be to the left of y and to the right of z. 
But this would mean x is both to the left of y and to the right of (some part of) z. 
So, if x's right edge is to the left of y's left edge, and x's left edge is to the right of z's right edge, we'd have x_r <= y_l and z_r <= x_l.
Given that z_l <= y_l (from y N z), we'd have x_r <= y_l and z_r <= x_l, while also z_l <= y_l. This would mean z_r <= x_l < x_r <= y_l, which would make z_r < y_l, contradicting the condition y_r <= z_r (from y N z).

So, I'm now confident that the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW and N only.

Wait one moment: I just realized that the constraint y_r <= z_r (from y N z) doesn't necessarily imply that z_r < y_l; it just means that the right edge of y is to the left of the right edge of z. The left edge of y and the right edge of z can still be in any relation, depending on the specific configuration.

Let's be more careful.

From y N z, we have z_l <= y_l and y_r <= z_r. This means the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z. 

From x NW y, we have x_r <= y_l. This means the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of y.

For x to be NE of z, we need z_r <= x_l. This means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x.

Combining the constraints:
- x_r <= y_l (from x NW y)
- z_l <= y_l (from y N z)
- y_r <= z_r (from y N z)
- z_r <= x_l (for x to be NE of z)

Let's check if there's a contradiction. From z_r <= x_l and x_l < x_r (by definition of a rectangle), we get z_r < x_r. Also, from x_r <= y_l, we get z_r < x_r <= y_l.

Now, from y_r <= z_r, we have y_r <= z_r < y_l. But in a well-defined rectangle, y_l < y_r. So, y_r <= z_r < y_l < y_r, which gives y_r < y_r, a contradiction.

So, the constraint combination for x to be NE of z does lead to a contradiction.
Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, are NW and N only.

Now, let's also verify the other two relationships by drawing it out. 

NW: Region x is NW of region z.
- Region x: Rectangle with coordinates (1, 4) to (3, 5)
- Region y: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 2) to (6, 3)
- Region z: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 0) to (8, 1)

This confirms that region x is NW of region z.

N: Region x is N of region z.
- Region x: Rectangle with coordinates (5, 4) to (7, 5)
- Region y: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 2) to (6, 3)
- Region z: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 0) to (8, 1)

Wait, in this configuration, region x might not be NW of region y, because their x-projections overlap. Let me adjust:

- Region x: Rectangle with coordinates (2, 4) to (3, 5)
- Region y: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 2) to (6, 3)
- Region z: Rectangle with coordinates (2, 0) to (8, 1)

Now, region x is NW of region y (x is entirely to the left and above y), region y is N of region z (y is entirely above z and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z), and region x is N of region z (x is entirely above z and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z).

Oops, I've made a mistake. For region x to be N of region z, its x-projection should be contained within the x-projection of z, which means: z_l <= x_l and x_r <= z_r. In the configuration I've just provided, x's x-projection is indeed contained within z's x-projection, since 2 <= 2 and 3 <= 8, so we're good.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, are NW and N.

Hmm, upon further reflection, I'm not entirely confident in ruling out the NE relationship. Let's double check. The key constraint was z_r <= x_l (for x to be NE of z), and we showed that this, combined with the other constraints, leads to the contradiction y_r < y_r.

Let's trace that again:
- From z_r <= x_l and x_l < x_r (definition of a rectangle), we get z_r < x_r.
- From x_r <= y_l (from x NW y), we get z_r < x_r <= y_l, which means z_r < y_l.
- From y_r <= z_r (from y N z), we get y_r <= z_r < y_l, which means y_r < y_l.
- But in a well-defined rectangle, y_l < y_r, which contradicts y_r < y_l.

I think that's right. the NE relationship is ruled out. So indeed, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, are NW and N.

Actually, wait...

From y N z, we have z_l <= y_l and y_r <= z_r.
From x NW y, we have x_r <= y_l.

If y_r <= z_r, it doesn't necessarily mean that z_r < y_l, just that y's right edge is to the left of z's right edge.

oh wait, I do have the constraint that x_r <= y_l (from x NW y), and from z_r <= x_l (for x to be NE of z). Since x_l < x_r (definition of a rectangle), we get z_r <= x_l < x_r <= y_l, which gives z_r < y_l. 

But from y N z, we know y_r <= z_r, so combining, we get y_r <= z_r < y_l, which means y_r < y_l. This contradicts the fact that a rectangle has y_l < y_r.

So indeed, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, are NW and N only.

Actually, one last time: the constraints are:
- x_r <= y_l (from x NW y)
- z_l <= y_l and y_r <= z_r (from y N z)
- z_r <= x_l (for x to be NE of z)

From z_r <= x_l and x_r <= y_l, we get z_r <= x_l < x_r <= y_l, which means z_r < y_l. But from y_r <= z_r, we get y_r <= z_r < y_l, which means y_r < y_l. This contradicts the fact that in a rectangle, y_l < y_r.

So, the cardinal direction relation NE between region x and region z is not possible.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, are NW and N only.

To summarize, I have demonstrated that given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z:
- Region x can be NW of region z.
- Region x can be N of region z.
- Region x cannot be NE of region z (as I've proven by showing that it leads to a contradiction).

For all other cardinal direction relations (W, SW, S, SE, E, B), region x cannot have those relations with region z because we've established that region x is entirely above region z (from supy(z) <= infy(x)), which is only consistent with the relations N, NW, and NE.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given the conditions, are NW and N.

To be thorough, let's find specific examples:

NW: 
- Region x: Rectangle with coordinates (1, 4) to (3, 5)
- Region y: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 2) to (6, 3)
- Region z: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 0) to (8, 1)

N: 
- Region x: Rectangle with coordinates (2, 4) to (3, 5)
- Region y: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 2) to (6, 3)
- Region z: Rectangle with coordinates (1, 0) to (4, 1)

In the N example, region x is NW of region y, region y is N of region z, and region x is N of region z.

Wait, I think there's a mistake in the N example. For x to be N of z, its x-projection needs to be entirely within the x-projection of z, which means z_l <= x_l and x_r <= z_r. In the provided example, we have 1 <= 2 but 3 > 4, which doesn't satisfy x_r <= z_r. Let me adjust:

N: 
- Region x: Rectangle with coordinates (2, 4) to (3, 5)
- Region y: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 2) to (6, 3)
- Region z: Rectangle with coordinates (1, 0) to (5, 1)

Now, region x's x-projection [2, 3] is contained within region z's x-projection [1, 5], making x N of z.

Let me double check our examples to make sure they satisfy the problem constraints:

NW: 
- Region x: Rectangle with coordinates (1, 4) to (3, 5)
- Region y: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 2) to (6, 3)
- Region z: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 0) to (8, 1)

To check if x is NW of y: 
- x_r = 3 <= y_l = 4, so x is entirely to the left of y. ✓
- y_t = 3 <= x_b = 4, so x is entirely above y. ✓

To check if y is N of z: 
- z_t = 1 <= y_b = 2, so y is entirely above z. ✓
- z_l = 4 <= y_l = 4 and y_r = 6 <= z_r = 8, so y's x-projection is within z's x-projection. ✓

To check if x is NW of z: 
- x_r = 3 <= z_l = 4, so x is entirely to the left of z. ✓
- z_t = 1 <= x_b = 4, so x is entirely above z. ✓

N: 
- Region x: Rectangle with coordinates (2, 4) to (3, 5)
- Region y: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 2) to (6, 3)
- Region z: Rectangle with coordinates (1, 0) to (5, 1)

To check if x is NW of y: 
- x_r = 3 <= y_l = 4, so x is entirely to the left of y. ✓
- y_t = 3 <= x_b = 4, so x is entirely above y. ✓

To check if y is N of z: 
- z_t = 1 <= y_b = 2, so y is entirely above z. ✓
- z_l = 1 <= y_l = 4 and y_r = 6 <= z_r = 5, which is not true... 6 > 5, so y's x-projection is not within z's x-projection. ✗

Let me fix the N example:

N: 
- Region x: Rectangle with coordinates (2, 4) to (3, 5)
- Region y: Rectangle with coordinates (4, 2) to (5, 3)
- Region z: Rectangle with coordinates (1, 0) to (6, 1)

To check if x is NW of y: 
- x_r = 3 <= y_l = 4, so x is entirely to the left of y. ✓
- y_t = 3 <= x_b = 4, so x is entirely above y. ✓

To check if y is N of z: 
- z_t = 1 <= y_b = 2, so y is entirely above z. ✓
- z_l = 1 <= y_l = 4 and y_r = 5 <= z_r = 6, so y's x-projection is within z's x-projection. ✓

To check if x is N of z: 
- z_t = 1 <= x_b = 4, so x is entirely above z. ✓
- z_l = 1 <= x_l = 2 and x_r = 3 <= z_r = 6, so x's x-projection is within z's x-projection. ✓

Both examples now correctly demonstrate the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given the constraints:
1. Region x can be NW of region z.
2. Region x can be N of region z.

So the answer is: NW and N.

ANSWER:

Looking at the given information:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

For x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) [x is entirely to the left of y]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) [x is entirely above y]

For y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) [y is entirely above z]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [y's x-projection within z's x-projection]

From these constraints, I can deduce:
- Since supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), by transitivity: supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  This means x is definitely above z, which narrows possibilities to N, NW, or NE.

For x to be NW of z:
- If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is entirely to the left of z, making the relation NW.

For x to be N of z:
- If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x's x-projection is within z's x-projection, making the relation N.

For x to be NE of z:
- This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- But from our constraints: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), y_r ≤ supx(z), which creates a contradiction where y_r < y_l.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, N
