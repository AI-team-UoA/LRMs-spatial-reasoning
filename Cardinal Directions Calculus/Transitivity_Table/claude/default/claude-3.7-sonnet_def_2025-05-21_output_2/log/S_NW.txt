PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

We have:
1. Region x is S of region y
2. Region y is NW of region z

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions:
- x S y means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From 1, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of y's left boundary or aligned with it)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of y's right boundary or aligned with it)

From 2, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)

Now, let's try to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the above constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from 1) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from 2). This means x is below y, and z is below y (or equivalently, y is above both x and z). But this doesn't directly tell us about the vertical relationship between x and z.

- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from 1) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from 2). This means x's left boundary is to the right of y's left boundary, and z's left boundary is to the right of y's right boundary. Since x's left boundary is to the right of y's left boundary and z's left boundary is to the right of y's right boundary, and since the right boundary is always to the right of the left boundary, it means z's left boundary is to the right of x's left boundary.

Let's see if we can make any conclusions about the relative positions of x and z based on the given constraints.

1. Horizontal relationship: 
   - We know z is to the right of y (since y is NW of z).
   - We know x can be to the right of y or partly overlapping with y horizontally (since x is S of y).
   - Therefore, x can be to the left of z, or partly overlapping with z horizontally, or even completely to the right of z.

2. Vertical relationship:
   - We know x is below y (since x is S of y).
   - We know z is below y (since y is NW of z).
   - Therefore, x and z can be at the same vertical level, or one can be above the other.

Let's think more precisely.

From the constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

This doesn't tell us the vertical relationship between x and z directly. x could be above, below, or at the same vertical level as z.

From the constraints:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y's range or partly overlapping)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (z is to the right of y)

This means x is horizontally within y's range or partly overlapping, and z is to the right of y. So, x is to the left of z or partly overlapping with z horizontally.

Wait, let me be more precise. If supx(y) ≤ infx(z), it means y is completely to the left of z (no horizontal overlap). And if infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y), it means x is horizontally within y's range or at the edge of y.

Combining these, it means x must be to the left of z (no horizontal overlap between x and z), because x is within y's horizontal range and z is to the right of y.

So, horizontally, x is to the left of z.

Vertically, x and z are both below y, but we don't know the exact vertical relationship between x and z. x could be above, below, or at the same vertical level as z.

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

1. If x is above z, and x is to the left of z, then x is NW of z. The relation would be "x NW z".
2. If x is at the same vertical level as z, and x is to the left of z, then x is W of z. The relation would be "x W z".
3. If x is below z, and x is to the left of z, then x is SW of z. The relation would be "x SW z".

But wait, I think I might need to be more careful with the constraints. Let me revisit this.

If y is NW of z, then supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y). This means y is to the left of z and y is above z.

If x is S of y, then supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). This means x is below y, and x's horizontal extent is within or at the edge of y's horizontal extent.

From these constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y). This means both x and z are below y, but I can't directly determine the vertical relationship between x and z.
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), and supx(y) ≤ infx(z). This means x's horizontal extent is within or at the edge of y's horizontal extent, and y is to the left of z. This implies that x is to the left of z.

Hmm, let's see if I can be a bit more systematic. Let's consider different possible positions of region x within the S region of y and different possible positions of region z given that y is NW of z.

If y is NW of z, it means z can be anywhere to the right of and below y. The exact position can vary, but z must satisfy supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

If x is S of y, it means x is directly below y, with its horizontal extent within or at the edge of y's horizontal extent. x must satisfy supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Let's visualize the situation. We have:

```
    y
   /
  /
 x   z
```

Where y is above and to the left of z, and x is below y.

Given these positions, x can be:
1. SW of z if x is to the left of and below z.
2. W of z if x is to the left of and at the same vertical level as z.
3. NW of z if x is to the left of and above z.
4. S of z if x is directly below z.

But wait, I need to check if all these relationships are consistent with the given constraints.

Given that x is S of y and y is NW of z, x must be to the left of z because x is horizontally within y's range and z is to the right of y.

Vertically, both x and z are below y, but their relative vertical positions can vary.

Let's check each possible relation:

1. x SW z: This means x is to the left of and below z. This is consistent with the constraints.
2. x W z: This means x is to the left of and at the same vertical level as z. This is consistent with the constraints.
3. x NW z: This means x is to the left of and above z. This is consistent with the constraints.
4. x S z: This means x is directly below z, which requires x and z to overlap horizontally. This isn't consistent because x should be to the left of z given the constraints.

So, the consistent relations are: SW, W, and NW.

But wait, I want to double-check relation 4. I said x S z is not consistent because x should be to the left of z given the constraints. Let me check this more carefully.

If x is S of y, it means infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). If y is NW of z, it means supx(y) ≤ infx(z). Combining these, we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). This implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z (no horizontal overlap). So, x cannot be directly below z (i.e., x S z is not possible).

This suggests that the consistent relations are: SW, W, and NW.

Let's check the relation "x SE z". This would mean x is to the right of and below z. This isn't consistent because x should be to the left of z given the constraints.

Let's check the relation "x E z". This would mean x is to the right of and at the same vertical level as z. This isn't consistent because x should be to the left of z given the constraints.

Let's check the relation "x NE z". This would mean x is to the right of and above z. This isn't consistent because x should be to the left of z given the constraints.

Let's check the relation "x N z". This would mean x is directly above z, which requires x and z to overlap horizontally. This isn't consistent because x should be to the left of z given the constraints.

Let's check the relation "x B z". This would mean z is contained within x. This isn't consistent because x should be to the left of z given the constraints.

OK, I think my earlier conclusion was correct. The consistent relations are: SW, W, and NW.

Wait, but there's one last thing I should account for, which are the bounding box constraints... Actually, wait, I need to properly check the constraint relationships with the definitions.

We have:
- x S y if and only if supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y NW z if and only if supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, let's look at the standard definitions of cardinal direction relations to check our candidates:
- x SW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- x W z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- x NW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Let's check if x SW z is a valid result:
From the given constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z) holds.
We also have supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but we don't know the relationship between infy(y) and infy(z) directly. We just know that supy(z) ≤ infy(y). So, we can't determine if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) holds.

Let's check if x W z is a valid result:
From the given constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z) holds.
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y). But we don't know the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), nor between supy(x) and supy(z). So, we can't determine if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) holds.

Let's check if x NW z is a valid result:
From the given constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z) holds.
We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). But we don't know the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z). So, we can't determine if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) holds.

OK, let me think more carefully.

We have these constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's try to translate them into constraints on the relative positions of x and z.

From the third and fourth constraints, we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the left of z.

From the first and fifth constraints, we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), and that tells us that both x and z are below y, but I can't determine the vertical relationship between x and z directly.

So, based on the constraints, x is to the left of z, but the vertical relationship between x and z can vary.

Given these constraints, let's check the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. x SW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z):
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so the first condition is satisfied.
   The second condition, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), can be satisfied if x is vertically below z.

2. x W z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z):
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so the first condition is satisfied.
   The second and third conditions, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), can be satisfied if x and z overlap vertically, with x's vertical extent within or at the edge of z's vertical extent.

3. x NW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x):
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so the first condition is satisfied.
   The second condition, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), can be satisfied if x is vertically above z.

4. x S z if and only if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z):
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. But for x to be S of z, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) must hold, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x S z is not possible.

5. x SE z if and only if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z):
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. But for x to be SE of z, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) must hold, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x SE z is not possible.

6. x E z if and only if supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z):
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. But for x to be E of z, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) must hold, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x E z is not possible.

7. x NE z if and only if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x):
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. But for x to be NE of z, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) must hold, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x NE z is not possible.

8. x N z if and only if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z):
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. But for x to be N of z, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) must hold, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x N z is not possible.

9. x B z if and only if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z):
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. But for x to be B z, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) must hold, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x B z is not possible.

Based on this detailed analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

Let's double-check.

Region x is S of region y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is at least partially to the right of y's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is at least partially to the left of y's right boundary)

Region y is NW of region z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

From these constraints, we can say that x is to the left of z (because supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), but the vertical relationship between x and z isn't directly constrained.

Let's check a different angle: Could region x and region z overlap? Given that x is to the left of z, they can't overlap horizontally. The question is about vertical overlap.

We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y). This means that both x and z are below y. But we don't have direct constraints on the vertical relationship between x and z.

So, the vertical positions of x and z relative to each other can vary, and this variation gives rise to the three possible cardinal direction relations: SW, W, and NW.

OK, let's now consider edge cases. Since x and z are limited to regions in REG - regions that are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk - they can't be arbitrarily shaped. But still, let's think if we've overlooked any relation.

I believe the relations NE, E, SE, N, S, and B are not possible given the constraints. I've already analyzed why S, SE, E, NE, and N are not possible above.

x B z would mean z is contained within x, which contradicts the constraint that x is to the left of z. So, x B z is not possible.

What about z B x? This would mean x is contained within z. Given that x is to the left of z, this is not possible. So, z B x is not possible.

Actually, wait, "B" isn't a relation from region x to region z; it's just indicating that z is in the bounding box of x. So, the question is: can z be in the bounding box of x?

But wait, I misinterpreted. Let's clarify the definitions:

a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)

So, x B z would mean that z's bounding box contains x's bounding box.

Given that x is to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), they don't overlap horizontally. For x B z to hold, we'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x B z is not possible.

What about other combined relations? 

Given the constraints, horizontal overlap between x and z is impossible. And they're both below y. The only possible relations are SW, W, and NW. Therefore, any combined relation would have to include at least one of these, and it can't include relations that require horizontal overlap (like S, B, or N) or those that place x to the right of z (like SE, E, or NE).

I'm convinced that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

Actually, let me revisit once more. Let me make sure that I understand these definitions.

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

Region a is South of region b if and only if:
1. The top of a is below the bottom of b, and
2. The left of a is the the right of the left of b (or aligned),
3. The right of a is to the left of the right of b (or aligned).

Hm, that matches with our understanding, and the other ones appear consistent.

Now, back to our problem. We have x S y and y NW z. We want to understand the relation between x and z.

From x S y, we know:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y NW z, we know:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z)
5. supy(z) <= infy(y)

From (3) and (4), we have:
6. supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z.

From (1) and (5), we have:
7. supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). Both x and z are below y. But this doesn't give us direct information about the vertical relation between x and z.

There are three possible vertical scenarios:
a. x is above z, meaning infy(x) > supy(z).
b. x overlaps vertically with z. In the most general case, infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(z). When we account for edge cases: x could be completely above z, or completely below z, or they could have vertical boundaries aligned.
c. x is below z, meaning supy(x) < infy(z).

Combining with the constraint that x is to the left of z:
- If x is above z, then x is NW of z.
- If x overlaps vertically with z, then x is W of z.
- If x is below z, then x is SW of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

But let me double-check with the precise definitions to make sure.

SW: a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
W: a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
NW: a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

Let's check them.

SW: we want to check if x SW z is possible.
- We already established that supx(x) <= infx(z) from (6).
- We need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible. There's no direct constraint that contradicts this. Given the constraint supy(x) <= infy(y), and the fact that z is not constrained in terms of its bottom boundary, it's possible for x to be below z. So, x SW z is possible.

W: we want to check if x W z is possible.
- We already established that supx(x) <= infx(z) from (6).
- We need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are possible. There's no direct constraint that contradicts these. Given the constraints, it's possible for x and z to have an overlapping vertical range. So, x W z is possible.

NW: we want to check if x NW z is possible.
- We already established that supx(x) <= infx(z) from (6).
- We need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible. From (5), we know supy(z) <= infy(y), and from (1), we know supy(x) <= infy(y). If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is above z. There's no direct constraint that says infy(x) can't be greater than supy(z). So, x NW z is possible.

So, based on the constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

Actually, now I'm second-guessing about x S z. Let me quickly verify:

S: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) might be possible, as discussed above.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) is required. But from (6), we know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x and z don't overlap horizontally. This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x S z is not possible.

E: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

For x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) is required. But from (6), we know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x E z is not possible.

N: a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) might be possible, as discussed above.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) is required. But from (6), we know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x and z don't overlap horizontally. This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x N z is not possible.

NE, SE, and B also aren't possible due to similar contradictions related to horizontal positioning.

That confirms that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

Hold on, let me make sure that I have the correct definition of combined cardinal direction relations. Based on the definition I'm working with, some combinations of directions might be valid. Let me double-check.

I read that a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where:
1. 1 <= k <= 9
2. R1, ..., Rk belong to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}
3. Ri != Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i != j
4. There are regions a1, ..., ak in REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b in REG.

This definition likely allows for combined direction relations. But I think we are asking for the single tile cardinal directions that can relate x and z. 

Given the constraints, x and z do not horizontally overlap (from the established constraint (6): supx(x) <= infx(z)). This means that x is strictly to the left of z.

Now, for the vertical relationship:
- If x is above z, then x is NW of z.
- If x overlaps vertically with z, then x is W of z.
- If x is below z, then x is SW of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, let me make sure if the question might be asking about combined relations.

No, I don't think so. The question is very specific: "which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" and the context is about the cardinal direction relation. I think the expected answers are the single-tile cardinal direction relations that describe the relation between x and z.

Given the constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, let me go back and re-read the exact phrasing of the question: "If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

Ah, I notice that the question specifically says "If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z..." So, it's asking for the possible relations of x relative to z (not z relative to x). 

For clarity, given the constraints I established: supx(x) <= infx(z) (from (6)), x is to the left of z. This is a fundamental constraint derived from the given relations.

Given this horizontal constraint:
- If x is above z, then x is NW of z.
- If x overlaps vertically with z, then x is W of z.
- If x is below z, then x is SW of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

I re-checked this multiple times, and I'm confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From the definition of S relation: 
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From the definition of NW relation:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- This means x is strictly to the left of z (no horizontal overlap)

Vertically, both x and z are below y, but their vertical relationship is not directly constrained. Therefore:

1. If x is above z: x NW z (x is to the left and above z)
2. If x vertically overlaps with z: x W z (x is to the left and at the same vertical level as z)
3. If x is below z: x SW z (x is to the left and below z)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, SW
