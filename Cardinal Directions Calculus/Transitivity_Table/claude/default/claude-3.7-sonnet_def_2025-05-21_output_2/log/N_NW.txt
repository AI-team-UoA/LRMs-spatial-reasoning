PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's solve this problem step by step. 

First, I'll reason about the cardinal directions:

1. x is N of y, which means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

2. y is NW of z, which means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now I need to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze what we can infer:

From x is N of y:
- x is above y (supy(y) <= infy(x))
- x is horizontally within the bounds of y (infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))

From y is NW of z:
- y is to the left of z (supx(y) <= infx(z))
- y is above z (supy(z) <= infy(y))

Combining these:
- x is above y, and y is above z, so x is definitely above z (i.e., supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x))
- y is to the left of z, and x is horizontally within y's bounds, which means x could be to the left of z or could overlap horizontally with z.

Let's consider the possible cases:

Case 1: If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is completely to the left of z. 
Since x is also above z, the relation would be NW.

Case 2: If infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x), then x overlaps horizontally with z.
Since x is above z, the relation would be N.

Case 3: If infx(z) <= infx(x), then x is at least partially to the right of z.
Since x is above z, the relation could be N or NE, depending on how far right x extends.

Let me check the horizontal relationships more carefully.

From x is N of y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y is NW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

This means supx(x) <= infx(z), which indicates that x is completely to the left of z.

Since x is above z and to the left of z, the relation between x and z is NW.

Wait, I think I made an error. Let me re-analyze carefully.

From x is N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y is NW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [x is to the left of z]

So, x is above z and to the left of z, making the relation NW.

But wait, I need to be more careful. The information "supx(x) <= supx(y)" and "supx(y) <= infx(z)" implies that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is completely to the left of z. So x is above and to the left of z, which means x is NW of z.

Hmm, but I wonder if I'm considering all possibilities correctly. Let me think about the constraints again.

From x is N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [left bound of x is within or to the right of left bound of y]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [right bound of x is within or to the left of right bound of y]

From y is NW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is above z]

Combining, we get:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [x is to the left of z]

This confirms that x is NW of z.

Actually, I just realized that I need to be more careful here. Let's think about what the constraints tell us.

From x is N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [left bound of x is within or to the right of left bound of y]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [right bound of x is within or to the left of right bound of y]

From y is NW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is above z]

Combining, we get:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [x is to the left of z]

So x is above z (which includes the N, NW, and NE relations) and to the left of z (which includes the NW, W, and SW relations). The intersection of these sets is just NW. So x is NW of z.

Actually, wait. I'm realizing that there's a subtlety I'm missing here. The constraint "infx(y) <= infx(x)" from x is N of y only tells us that the left bound of x is to the right of or equal to the left bound of y. But it doesn't tell us whether infx(x) <= infx(z) or infx(z) <= infx(x). The former would be consistent with x being NW of z, while the latter would be consistent with x being N or NE of z.

Let's think about this differently.

From x is N of y, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [vertical constraint]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) [horizontal constraints]

From y is NW of z, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [vertical constraint]
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [horizontal constraint]

Combining the vertical constraints, we get:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
So x is above z. This is consistent with x being N, NW, or NE of z.

Combining the horizontal constraints, we get:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This implies:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
So x is to the left of z. This is consistent with x being NW, W, or SW of z.

Given that x is both above z and to the left of z, the only consistent relation is NW.

So the answer is: the relation between x and z is NW.

Wait, I'm not convinced by my reasoning. I need to consider all of the possible regions satisfying these constraints and determine all of the possible relations between x and z.

If we're given that x is N of y, then the minimum bounding box of x is within the North tile of y. And if y is NW of z, then the minimum bounding box of y is within the NorthWest tile of z.

Actually, let me try to visualize this. 

Let's imagine a coordinate system where z is centered at the origin.

If y is NW of z, then y is in the quadrant where both x and y coordinates are negative. The minimum bounding box of y is entirely within this quadrant.

Now, if x is N of y, then x is above y. The minimum bounding box of x is within the "North" tile of y. What could this tell us about the relation between x and z?

Hmm, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to use the original definitions.

For y NW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is above z]

For x N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) [x is within the horizontal bounds of y]

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [x is to the left of z]

So x is above z and to the left of z, which means x is in the NW relation to z.

Actually, let me do a more formal approach.

We are told that:
1. x is N of y
2. y is NW of z

Let's use the cardinal direction definitions:

For x is N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y is NW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z.

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our given constraints, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
So, the first condition for N is satisfied.

But for the second condition, we know:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
Which implies supx(x) <= infx(z), contradicting the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for N.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

From our given constraints, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
So, the first condition for NE is satisfied.

But for the second condition, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [from x is N of y]
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [from y is NW of z]
We can't directly deduce whether supx(z) <= infx(x) from these.

Hmm, I may be making a mistake or maybe there's a missing constraint here. 

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself. Let's step back and think about this in simpler terms.

If y is NW of z, then y is in the northwest quadrant relative to z. And if x is N of y, then x is in the north direction relative to y, which is already in the northwest direction relative to z.

Now, the question is: where can x be relative to z?

Given the constraints:
- x is above y (N of y)
- y is northwest of z (above and to the left of z)

It follows that x is above z (because y is above z and x is above y). But the horizontal relationship between x and z requires more analysis.

We know that the horizontal extent of x is within the horizontal extent of y (from x is N of y). And y is to the left of z (from y is NW of z). Hence, x is also to the left of z.

So, x is above z and to the left of z, making x NW of z.

Actually, I'm not being precise enough. Let me go back to the formal definitions and be more explicit.

For x is N of y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) [x's horizontal extent is within y's]

For y is NW of z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is above z]

Combining these:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [x's horizontal extent is to the left of z]

This means x is above z and to the left of z, confirming that x is NW of z.

Actually, I don't think I'm fully considering all possibilities. Let me reason through this a bit differently.

We have two constraints:
1. x is N of y
2. y is NW of z

From these, I want to determine all possible relations between x and z.

Let's analyze the vertical and horizontal components separately:

Vertical Component:
- From "x is N of y", we know supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above y.
- From "y is NW of z", we know supy(z) <= infy(y), which means y is above z.
- Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above z.

Horizontally, there are several cases to consider:

1. x is to the left of z:
   - From "x is N of y", we know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
   - From "y is NW of z", we know supx(y) <= infx(z).
   - Combining, we get supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

2. x overlaps with z horizontally:
   - For this, we'd need infx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(z) <= supx(x).
   - But we've already shown supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= supx(x).
   - So, x cannot overlap with z horizontally.

3. x is to the right of z:
   - For this, we'd need infx(x) >= supx(z).
   - But again, we've shown infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), which doesn't tell us anything definitive about the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z).

Wait, actually, let's be a bit more careful with the horizontal component. We're trying to determine if x can also be N or NE of z.

From "x is N of y", we know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
From "y is NW of z", we know supx(y) <= infx(z).

Combining, we get supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z). This implies that x is to the left of z.

But to be N of z, x would need to satisfy infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Our derived constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts infx(z) <= supx(x), so x cannot be N of z.

Similarly, for x to be NE of z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x). But our derived constraint infx(y) <= infx(x) doesn't tell us anything definitive about the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).

Ok, so I think there's a misunderstanding on my part. Let's just visualize these constraints for clarification:

For "x is N of y":
- x's bounding box is within the N tile of y.
- This means x is above y and horizontally within y's bounds.

For "y is NW of z":
- y's bounding box is within the NW tile of z.
- This means y is above and to the left of z.

Given these, if x is above y and y is above z, then x is above z.
If x is horizontally within y's bounds and y is to the left of z, then x is also to the left of z.

So, x is above and to the left of z, making the relationship between x and z as NW.

Actually, I think there might be another way to look at this. Let's consider the bounding box of z and divide the space into 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B, which is the bounding box itself). The question is: in which of these tiles can region x lie?

We know:
- x is N of y (so x lies in the N tile of y)
- y is NW of z (so y lies in the NW tile of z)

If y is in the NW tile of z, then y is in the quadrant that's above and to the left of z. And if x is in the N tile of y, then x is above y and their projection on the x-axis overlap.

So while both y and x are above z, their horizontal relationships with z can differ. y is to the left of z, but x, being in the N tile of y, can still extend rightwards.

Let's visualize:
```
    x (N of y)
   /
  /
 y (NW of z)
/
z
```

In this case, x could be NW of z if it's entirely to the left of z. Or, x could be N of z if it horizontally overlaps with z. Or, x could even be NE of z if it's entirely to the right of z.

Wait, but we already showed that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z. So, x can only be NW of z.

Hmm, I'm not getting it right. Let's trace through the definitions and constraints one more time.

For "x is N of y":
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

For "y is NW of z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [x's horizontal extent is to the left of z]

This means x is above z and to the left of z, confirming that x is NW of z.

Let me double check if we can derive anything else:

For "x is N of y", the first constraint supy(y) <= infy(x) tells us x is strictly above y. The second constraint infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) tells us that the projection of x on the x-axis is a subset of the projection of y on the x-axis.

For "y is NW of z", the constraint supx(y) <= infx(z) tells us y is strictly to the left of z. The constraint supy(z) <= infy(y) tells us y is strictly above z.

Combining these:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x is strictly above z]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [x is strictly to the left of z]

So, x is both strictly above z and strictly to the left of z, which means x is in the NW relation to z.

Actually, I think I underestimated a layer of complexity. Let's consider one more time:

For x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) [x's horizontal extent is within y's]

For y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is above z]

From the vertical constraints, we can conclude that x is above z (supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)).

From the horizontal constraints, we can derive supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

So, x is both above z and to the left of z, confirming the relation as NW.

Ok, I'm getting confused in my reasoning. Let's be even more explicit.

We know:
1. x is N of y, meaning x is in the N tile of y.
2. y is NW of z, meaning y is in the NW tile of z.

We're asking: what are the possible tiles of z that x can lie in?

Let's visualize the 9 tiles around z:
```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | B | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

If y is in the NW tile of z, then y is above and to the left of z. And if x is in the N tile of y, then x is above y and horizontally within y's bounds.

Given these constraints, x must be above z (because y is above z and x is above y). Horizontally, x is within y's bounds, and y is to the left of z. Since y is to the left of z and x's horizontal extent is within y's, x must also be to the left of z.

So, x is both above z and to the left of z, making the relation between x and z as NW.

Actually, I've been going in circles. Let me make a clear, step-by-step logical deduction.

We have:
1. x is N of y, meaning:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's horizontal extent is within y's)
2. y is NW of z, meaning:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

We want to find the relation between x and z.

Step 1: Consider the vertical relation.
From "x is N of y", we know supy(y) <= infy(x).
From "y is NW of z", we know supy(z) <= infy(y).
Combining, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
This means x is above z.

Step 2: Consider the horizontal relation.
From "x is N of y", we know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
From "y is NW of z", we know supx(y) <= infx(z).
Combining, we get supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).
This means x is to the left of z.

Step 3: Determine the cardinal direction relation.
Since x is both above z and to the left of z, the relation between x and z is NW.

Wait, that can't be the only possible relation. Let me try to think of a counterexample:

Suppose:
- y is in the NW tile of z.
- x is in the N tile of y.

If y is significantly to the left of z, and x is just slightly to the right of y (but still within y's horizontal bounds and above y), then x might still be to the left of z (making the relation NW) or it might overlap with z horizontally (making the relation N).

Wait, no, we showed that supx(x) <= infx(z) actually we can't have the N relation.

What about the NE relation? Could x be in the NE tile of z?

For x to be in the NE tile of z, we'd need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z) - This is already established.
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)

But we've already shown that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).

So, x cannot be in the NE tile of z.

Are there any other potential relations? Let's consider them all:

1. N: We've already shown that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition for N (which requires x to horizontally overlap with z).
2. NE: We've already shown this to be impossible.
3. E: This is impossible because we've shown x is above z, and E would require x to be horizontally aligned with z.
4. SE: This is impossible because we've shown x is above z, and SE would require x to be below z.
5. S: This is impossible because we've shown x is above z, and S would require x to be below z.
6. SW: This is impossible because we've shown x is above z, and SW would require x to be below z.
7. W: This is impossible because we've shown x is above z, and W would require x to be horizontally aligned with z.
8. B: This is impossible because we've shown x is above z, and B would require x to be within z's bounding box.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I realize there's a reason my reasoning kept coming out to only one possibility. It's because the constraints are tight enough that there's only one possible relation between x and z.

Given two tiles, if we're told one region is in a specific tile relative to the other, there's a definite relationship between them. And if we're then told a third region is in a specific tile relative to the first, we can often infer a definite relationship between the third and second regions. That's the case here.

So, the possible relation between x and z is only NW.

Actually, let's double-check by drawing the regions and their relations. Suppose we have regions z, y, and x with the following coordinates:

z = (0, 0, 1, 1) [left, bottom, right, top]
y = (-3, 2, -1, 4) [left, bottom, right, top]
x = (-2.5, 5, -1.5, 6) [left, bottom, right, top]

Let's check the relations:

Is y NW of z?
- supx(y) = -1, infx(z) = 0, so supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) = 1, infy(y) = 2, so supy(z) <= infy(y)
Yes, y is NW of z.

Is x N of y?
- supy(y) = 4, infy(x) = 5, so supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) = -3, infx(x) = -2.5, supx(x) = -1.5, supx(y) = -1, so infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
Yes, x is N of y.

Is x NW of z?
- supx(x) = -1.5, infx(z) = 0, so supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) = 1, infy(x) = 5, so supy(z) <= infy(x)
Yes, x is NW of z.

Let's modify our example to see if we can get a different relation between x and z:

z = (0, 0, 1, 1)
y = (-3, 2, -1, 4)
x = (-0.5, 5, 0.5, 6)

But wait when I change the configuration for x to (-0.5, 5, 0.5, 6), there's a problem: supx(x) = 0.5, which is not less than or equal to supx(y) = -1. This contradicts the condition for x N y, which requires supx(x) <= supx(y). 

Actually, let me try once more to be thorough.

Let's try once more with:

z = (0, 0, 1, 1)
y = (-3, 2, -1, 4)
x = (-2.5, 5, -2, 6)

Is y NW of z?
- supx(y) = -1, infx(z) = 0, so supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) = 1, infy(y) = 2, so supy(z) <= infy(y)
Yes, y is NW of z.

Is x N of y?
- supy(y) = 4, infy(x) = 5, so supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) = -3, infx(x) = -2.5, supx(x) = -2, supx(y) = -1, so infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
Yes, x is N of y.

Is x NW of z?
- supx(x) = -2, infx(z) = 0, so supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) = 1, infy(x) = 5, so supy(z) <= infy(x)
Yes, x is NW of z. Still NW.

Let's be a bit broader: Can x be any other relation than NW to z? Let's see if we can construct counterexamples.

Suppose x is N of z:
For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's horizontal extent is within z's)

We've already established supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

Now, suppose x is NE of z:
For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)

Again, we've already established supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

For similar reasons, x cannot be E, SE, S, SW, W, or B of z, as we've already established it's strictly above and to the left of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

I'm convinced: the possible relation between x and z is only NW.

Actually, hang on. I need to reconsider the problem once more from the beginning. 

Let's recap the constraints we're given:
1. x is N of y
2. y is NW of z

Now, let's break down what these constraints mean:

For "x is N of y":
- x's region lies entirely in the N tile of y's bounding box.

For "y is NW of z":
- y's region lies entirely in the NW tile of z's bounding box.

Now, I want to determine the possible relations between x and z. To do so, I need to determine which tiles of z's bounding box the region x can occupy.

Given that y is in the NW tile of z and x is in the N tile of y, the question is: where can x be in relation to z?

From "x is N of y", we know x is above y and horizontally within y's bounds.
From "y is NW of z", we know y is above and to the left of z.

Given these, x must be above z (since y is above z and x is above y). Horizontally, x is within y's bounds, which is to the left of z, so x is also to the left of z.

So, x is both above and to the left of z, making the relation between x and z as NW.

Are there any other possible relations? Let's see:

For x to be N of z, it would need to be horizontally aligned with z. But since x is horizontally within y's bounds and y is to the left of z, this is impossible.

For x to be NE of z, it would need to be to the right of z. But for similar reasons, this is also impossible.

For x to be W of z, it would need to be horizontally aligned with z (vertically). But x is above z, so this doesn't work.

And for x to be in any of the S, SE, SW, or B relations, it would need to be either aligned with or below z, which can't be the case.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, maybe it's best to map the whole example to coordinates to make sure. Let's set:

z = (0, 0, 3, 3)

For y to be NW of z, it needs to satisfy:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) = 0 (so supx(y) <= 0)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) = 3 (so supy(z) <= 3)

Let's set y = (-5, 5, -1, 8), which is above and to the left of z.

Now, for x to be N of y, it needs to satisfy:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) = 8 (so infy(x) >= 8)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) = -5 <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= -1

Now, let's set x = (-4, 10, -2, 12), which is above y and horizontally within y's bounds.

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = -2, infx(z) = 0, so supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) = 3, infy(x) = 10, so supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

This makes the relation between x and z NW. But we have to make sure this is the only relation, by checking all of the other conceivable relations.

For x to be in the N tile of z:
- We'd need x to be horizontally aligned with z. This would require supx(x) >= infx(z) and infx(x) <= supx(z). But with our set coordinates, supx(x) = -2 and infx(z) = 0, so supx(x) < infx(z), which contradicts the horizontal alignment.

For x to be in the NE tile of z:
- We'd need supx(z) <= infx(x). But with our coordinates, supx(z) = 3 and infx(x) = -4, so supx(z) > infx(x), which contradicts this condition.

Similarly, we can check for all other directions, and none of them will be satisfied due to x being both above and to the left of z.

So, the possible relation between x and z is only NW. 

Actually, let me revisit my definition of the cardinal direction relations:

For the cardinal direction relation R(x, z):

1. B (Bounding Box): infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
2. S (South): supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
3. SW (South West): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
4. W (West): supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
5. NW (North West): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
6. N (North): supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
7. NE (North East): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
8. E (East): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
9. SE (South East): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the constraints we have, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [x is to the left of z]

Checking against the relations above, the only one that matches for (x, z) is NW.

So, the possible relation between x and z is only NW.

Wait, I realized that I incorrectly wrote the BOUNDING BOX (B). 

Let me just rewrite all of the cardinal directions to be sure (directly from the definition given in the problem):

- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

From the constraints we have derived:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [x is to the left of z]

For x to be in the NW relation to z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z) [Satisfied]
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z) [Satisfied]

So, the relation between x and z is indeed NW.

Ok, so my answer is that the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Hmm, but that's weird. I feel like there might be more than one relation, and I might have made a reasoning error earlier.

Actually, let me once more reason through the problem, using concrete examples.

We have:
1. x is N of y.
2. y is NW of z.

Now, let's set specific coordinates to test this:

z = (0, 0, 3, 3)
For y to be NW of z, it needs to be above and to the left of z. Let's set y = (-5, 5, -1, 8).

Now, for x to be N of y, it needs to be above y and horizontally within y's bounds. There are several possibilities:

x1 = (-5, 10, -1, 12) [Horizontally aligned with y from left to right]
x2 = (-4, 10, -2, 12) [Horizontally within but slightly narrower than y]
x3 = (-5, 10, -3, 12) [Horizontally within but shifted to the left within y]
x4 = (-3, 10, -1, 12) [Horizontally within but shifted to the right within y]

Let's check the relation between each of these x's and z:

For x1:
- supx(x1) = -1, infx(z) = 0, so supx(x1) < infx(z) [x1 is to the left of z]
- supy(z) = 3, infy(x1) = 10, so supy(z) < infy(x1) [x1 is above z]
So, x1 is NW of z.

For x2:
- supx(x2) = -2, infx(z) = 0, so supx(x2) < infx(z) [x2 is to the left of z]
- supy(z) = 3, infy(x2) = 10, so supy(z) < infy(x2) [x2 is above z]
So, x2 is NW of z.

For x3:
- supx(x3) = -3, infx(z) = 0, so supx(x3) < infx(z) [x3 is to the left of z]
- supy(z) = 3, infy(x3) = 10, so supy(z) < infy(x3) [x3 is above z]
So, x3 is NW of z.

For x4:
- supx(x4) = -1, infx(z) = 0, so supx(x4) < infx(z) [x4 is to the left of z]
- supy(z) = 3, infy(x4) = 10, so supy(z) < infy(x4) [x4 is above z]
So, x4 is NW of z.

Actually, this could generalize to any region x that's N of y. If y is NW of z, then any region x that's N of y will also be NW of z.

So, the relation between x and z is strictly NW. 

That doesn't match my intuition, so let me approach the problem from one more angle.

We have:
1. x is N of y
2. y is NW of z

We've established that if x is N of y, then x is above y and horizontally within y's bounds. And if y is NW of z, then y is above and to the left of z.

We've also deduced that x is above z (because y is above z and x is above y). Horizontally, we know that x is within y's bounds, and y is to the left of z. This means x is to the left of z.

So, x is both above and to the left of z, making the relation between x and z as NW.

Honestly, I think my confusion has come from the same exact derivation over and over again. I believe the answer is NW, and there's only one possible relation.

Actually, let's check the horizontal constraint. 

We know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) 
- supx(y) <= infx(z)

Combining, we get infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

So, we have established that supx(x) <= infx(z), meaning x is to the left of z.
We have also established that supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is above z.

So, x is both above and to the left of z, which is consistent with the NW relation.

Alright, I'm going to conclude that the possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I think I may have missed something. Let me try to analyze the problem from a different angle.

We know:
1. x is N of y (from this and the definition, we can infer that x is above y, and x is horizontally inside y)
2. y is NW of z (from this and the definition, we can infer that y is above and to the left of z)

Given these constraints, x is above z (because y is above z and x is above y). But horizontally, x is within y's bounds, which is to the left of z.

So, x is both above and to the left of z, making the relation NW.

But let's revisit the constraints more carefully. 

For "x is N of y", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) [x horizontally within y]

For "y is NW of z", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is above z]

Combining these, we get:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [x is to the left of z]

Given these constraints, the relation between x and z is NW.

Alright, I'm going to restate this one more time, just to be sure:

From the constraints we know:
- x is N of y: x is above y and its horizontal extent (projection on x-axis) is within y's.
- y is NW of z: y is above and to the left of z.
=> From these, we can derive:
  - x is above z (because y is above z and x is above y).
  - x is to the left of z (because x's right bound is to the left of y's right bound, which is to the left of z's left bound).
=> Therefore, x is both above and to the left of z, making the relation between x and z as NW.

And again, to be explicit, the way we arrive at this is:
1. Given: x is N of y => supy(y) <= infy(x) and infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
2. Given: y is NW of z => supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y).
3. Combine 1 & 2 => supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).
4. From 3, we know x is above z and to the left of z, making the relation between x and z NW.

So, the possible relation between x and z is NW. This relation is completely determined by the given constraints.

Yep, I'm convinced the answer is NW. I trust my explanation above and the reasoning I've gone through.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions provided, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y
- y is NW of z

Let me analyze what we know:

1. From "x is N of y":
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) [x is above y]
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) [x's horizontal extent is within y's bounds]

2. From "y is NW of z":
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) [y is above z]

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) [x is above z]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) [x is to the left of z]

For region x to be NW of region z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) [x is to the left of z] - This is satisfied
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) [x is above z] - This is satisfied

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.
