PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the relationships we have:
1. Region x is N of region y
2. Region y is S of region z

We need to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

From the definitions provided:
- If a N b, then supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
- If a S b, then supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

So we have:
1. x N y means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

2. y S z means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now let's determine the relationship between x and z.

First, about the y-coordinates:
- From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

We can't directly relate infy(x) and infy(z) from these inequalities.

Next, for the x-coordinates:
- From x N y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y S z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

So we have infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means the x-coordinate range of x is contained within the x-coordinate range of z.

Let's reflect on what we know so far:
1. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the x-range of x is contained in the x-range of z)
2. We don't know the exact relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z could be:
- N (North): If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- NW (North West): If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- NE (North East): If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- B (Bounding Box): If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- W (West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- E (East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- SW (South West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- S (South): If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- SE (South East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Wait, I think I made an error in my reasoning. Let's carefully analyze the constraints given by the information:

1. x N y means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (left boundary of x is to the right of or equal to left boundary of y)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (right boundary of x is to the left of or equal to right boundary of y)

2. y S z means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (left boundary of y is to the right of or equal to left boundary of z)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (right boundary of y is to the left of or equal to right boundary of z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from 1)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from 2)

This means both x and z are above y, but we don't know their relative positions.

- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from 1)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from 2)

Combining: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so left boundary of x is to the right of or equal to left boundary of z.

- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from 1)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from 2)

Combining: supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so right boundary of x is to the left of or equal to right boundary of z.

So, the x-coordinates of x are contained within the range of z's x-coordinates. But we don't know the relation between the y-coordinates of x and z.

Let's revisit the potential cardinal directions:

1. N (North): 
   - Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - Uncertain: supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - Possible? Yes, if x is directly above z.

2. NW (North West):
   - Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - We've established: supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - But this doesn't imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x can't be to the west of z.
   - Possible? No.

3. NE (North East):
   - Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - These are contradictory (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x) would mean infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is illogical for regions).
   - Possible? No.

4. B (Bounding Box):
   - Need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - Uncertain: infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - Possible? Yes, if x is contained within z.

5. W (West):
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We've established: supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - But this doesn't imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x can't be to the west of z.
   - Possible? No.

6. E (East):
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - These are contradictory (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x) would mean infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is illogical for regions).
   - Possible? No.

7. SW (South West):
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We've established: supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - But this doesn't imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x can't be to the west of z.
   - Possible? No.

8. S (South):
   - Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - Uncertain: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - Possible? Yes, if x is directly below z.

9. SE (South East):
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - These are contradictory (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x) would mean infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is illogical for regions).
   - Possible? No.

Looking at this more closely, I think I've been making an error. Let's revisit the definitions.

From the definition of the cardinal directions:

1. a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

This means a is to the north of b, a's bottom edge is above or at the same level as b's top edge, and a's left-to-right span is within b's left-to-right span.

2. a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

This means a is to the south of b, a's top edge is below or at the same level as b's bottom edge, and a's left-to-right span is within b's left-to-right span.

Let me rethink the logic:

1. x N y means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (left boundary of x is to the right or equal to left boundary of y)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (right boundary of x is to the left or equal to right boundary of y)

2. y S z means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (left boundary of y is to the right or equal to left boundary of z)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (right boundary of y is to the left or equal to right boundary of z)

The crucial point here is that y is below both x and z. Let's try to derive some constraints for x with respect to z:

- x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)). This doesn't directly tell us whether x is above, below, or at the same level as z.

- The left boundary of x is to the right or equal to the left boundary of y (infx(y) ≤ infx(x)), and the left boundary of y is to the right or equal to the left boundary of z (infx(z) ≤ infx(y)). Transitively, infx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means the left boundary of x is to the right or equal to the left boundary of z.

- The right boundary of x is to the left or equal to the right boundary of y (supx(x) ≤ supx(y)), and the right boundary of y is to the left or equal to the right boundary of z (supx(y) ≤ supx(z)). Transitively, supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This means the right boundary of x is to the left or equal to the right boundary of z.

So, the x-coordinates of region x are contained within the range of z's x-coordinates (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)). 

But we don't know the relative positions of x and z in terms of y-coordinates. Let's consider the possible relationships:

1. x could be above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)): Then x N z.
2. x could overlap with z in the y-direction: Then, given that the x-coordinates of x are contained within z, x B z.
3. x could be below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)): Then x S z.

Wait, I realize there's a logical constraint I didn't consider.
- x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

From these, we can infer:
- supy(y) ≤ min(infy(x), infy(z))

But this doesn't directly tell us whether x is above, below, or at the same level as z in the y-direction.

Let's consider a concrete example to clarify:
Say Region y has coordinates (1,1) to (3,2).
Region x (being N of y) can have coordinates like (1.5, 3) to (2.5, 4) (it's above y and its x-span is within y).
Region z (with y being S of it) can have coordinates like (0, 3) to (4, 4) (y is below it and the x-span of y is within z).

In this example, the relationship between x and z would be x B z (as x is contained within z).

But we could have another example:
Region y has coordinates (1,1) to (3,2).
Region x (being N of y) can have coordinates like (1.5, 3) to (2.5, 4).
Region z (with y being S of it) can have coordinates like (0, 4.5) to (4, 5.5).

In this example, the relationship would be x S z (as x is below z).

Let's consider one more example:
Region y has coordinates (1,1) to (3,2).
Region x (being N of y) can have coordinates like (1.5, 3) to (2.5, 4).
Region z (with y being S of it) can have coordinates like (0, 2.5) to (4, 3.5).

In this example, the relationship would be x N z (as x is above z).

So based on our examples and the constraints derived, the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- N (North): If x is above z and the x-span of x is within the x-span of z.
- S (South): If x is below z and the x-span of x is within the x-span of z.
- B (Bounding Box): If x is within z.

Let's now confirm if there are any more possibilities.

Could region x be to the west (W) or east (E) of region z? 
For x to be to the west of z, we would need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But we've established that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right or equal to the left boundary of z). These are contradictory, so x cannot be to the west of z.

For x to be to the east of z, we would need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we've established that supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left or equal to the right boundary of z). If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is a contradiction for a region (the right boundary must be to the right of the left boundary).

I've ruled out W and E, but what about the corner directions (NW, NE, SW, SE)?

For x NW z: We would need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But as discussed, x cannot be to the west of z, so NW is also not possible.

For x NE z: We would need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But as discussed, x cannot be to the east of z, so NE is also not possible.

For x SW z: We would need supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But as discussed, x cannot be to the west of z, so SW is also not possible.

For x SE z: We would need supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But as discussed, x cannot be to the east of z, so SE is also not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- N (North)
- S (South)
- B (Bounding Box)

I think I got confused before because I was thinking only about the containment in the x-direction and ignoring the possible relationships in the y-direction. Let me double-check this.

For N:
- Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- Uncertain: supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (this is possible in some configurations)
- So, N is a possible relationship.

For S:
- Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- Uncertain: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (this is possible in some configurations)
- So, S is a possible relationship.

For B:
- Need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- Uncertain: infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (this is possible in some configurations)
- So, B is a possible relationship.

These are the only possible relationships given the constraints. Let me now ensure there isn't anything else I'm missing.

Actually, I think I've overlooked another possibility. The constraints we've derived are:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right or equal to the left boundary of z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left or equal to the right boundary of z)

These constraints suggest that the x-span of region x is contained within the x-span of region z. But what if regions x and z have equal x-spans? That is, what if infx(z) = infx(x) and supx(x) = supx(z)?

This is still consistent with our derived constraints, and it opens up the possibility of x being equal to z in terms of x-coordinates. But we have no constraints on the y-coordinates, so x and z could be positioned in various ways relative to each other.

However, even with equal x-spans, the only possible relationships between x and z are still N, S, and B.

To be thorough, let's check the remaining directions:

For W:
- Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (unless x is empty, which is not the case for regions in REG).
- So, W is not a possible relationship.

For E:
- Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- We've established: supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (unless x is empty, which is not the case for regions in REG).
- So, E is not a possible relationship.

For NW:
- Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (unless x is empty, which is not the case for regions in REG).
- So, NW is not a possible relationship.

For NE:
- Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- We've established: supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (unless x is empty, which is not the case for regions in REG).
- So, NE is not a possible relationship.

For SW:
- Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (unless x is empty, which is not the case for regions in REG).
- So, SW is not a possible relationship.

For SE:
- Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- We've established: supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (unless x is empty, which is not the case for regions in REG).
- So, SE is not a possible relationship.

So, the only possible relationships between x and z are:
- N (North)
- S (South)
- B (Bounding Box)

Wait, I think I need to be more careful about the NW, NE, SW, and SE directions.

For NW:
- Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means the right boundary of x is to the left of its left boundary, which is a contradiction for a region in REG.
- So, NW is not a possible relationship.

For NE:
- Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- We've established: supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- These two imply infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(x) = supx(z) = infx(x). This is a degenerate case where the x-span of x is just a point, which seems to contradict the assumption that regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk.
- So, NE is not a possible relationship in the general case.

For SW:
- Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- We've established: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means the right boundary of x is to the left of its left boundary, which is a contradiction for a region in REG.
- So, SW is not a possible relationship.

For SE:
- Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- We've established: supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- These two imply infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(x) = supx(z) = infx(x). This is a degenerate case where the x-span of x is just a point, which seems to contradict the assumption that regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk.
- So, SE is not a possible relationship in the general case.

I think I'm running into issues because the conditions I'm considering involve strict inequalities. Let's revisit the definitions given:

a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
a E b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

Given the original problem:
1. x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
2. y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these, we can derive the following:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [from 1 and 2]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [from 1 and 2]
- supy(y) ≤ min(infy(x), infy(z)) [from 1 and 2]

The x-conditions tell us that the x-span of x is contained within the x-span of z. The y-condition doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z.

Let's check each possible relationship systematically:

1. x N z:
   - Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - We already have: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - The condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) can be satisfied in some arrangements, so N is possible.

2. x S z:
   - Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - We already have: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - The condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) can be satisfied in some arrangements, so S is possible.

3. x B z:
   - Need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We already have: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - The conditions infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can be satisfied in some arrangements, so B is possible.

4. x NW z:
   - Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - We have: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - For both infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z) to be true, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(x). This is a contradiction for a non-empty region, so NW is not possible.

5. x NE z:
   - Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - We have: supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - For both supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x) to be true, we need supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(x). This is a contradiction for a non-empty region, so NE is not possible.

6. x W z:
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We have: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - For both infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z) to be true, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(x). This is a contradiction for a non-empty region, so W is not possible.

7. x E z:
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We have: supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - For both supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x) to be true, we need supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(x). This is a contradiction for a non-empty region, so E is not possible.

8. x SW z:
   - Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - We have: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - For both infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z) to be true, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(x). This is a contradiction for a non-empty region, so SW is not possible.

9. x SE z:
   - Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - We have: supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - For both supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x) to be true, we need supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(x). This is a contradiction for a non-empty region, so SE is not possible.

So, the only possible relationships between x and z are:
- N (North)
- S (South)
- B (Bounding Box)

So, in summary the possible relations between region x and region z are:

1. N (North)
2. S (South)
3. B (Bounding Box)

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

N, S, B

Explanation:
From the given information, we know:
- x is North of y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is South of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

This means x's x-range is contained within z's x-range. However, we don't know the exact relationship between their y-coordinates.

Three possibilities exist:
- N: x could be above z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- S: x could be below z (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
- B: x could be contained within z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
