PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me think through this step by step. 

We have:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is N of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall what these relationships mean:

1) x B y means:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
   This means x is fully contained within the bounding box of y.

2) y N z means:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
   This means y is to the north of z.

Now let's determine what constraints these place on the relationship between x and z:

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

The first line tells us that region x is strictly above region z (because supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).
The second line tells us that the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.

This matches the definition of N (North) relation: x N z.

But wait, let me check if there are other possibilities...

Actually, the second constraint (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)) doesn't necessarily mean that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) or supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

Let me revise. From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y N z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

So, indeed, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.

Given that supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly above z) and the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z, x N z is the only possibility.

Actually, I need to be more careful with this. Let me reconsider the constraints.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From the first line, we can deduce that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is strictly above z. This could correspond to relations N, NE, or NW.

From the second and third lines, we have:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

This means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.

Given that x is strictly above z and the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z, the relation x N z holds.

But wait, these are just necessary conditions, not sufficient conditions for N. I need to check the exact definition of N:

a N b if and only if:
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is strictly above b)
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b) (a's x-projection is contained within b's x-projection)

The conditions we've derived match exactly with the definition of N. So, x N z.

Wait, I think I might be making an error in the constraints. Let me double-check the definition of B:

a B b if and only if:
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a)
- supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a)
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b)

So for x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From the first constraint, we have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is strictly above z. This is a characteristic of relations N, NW, and NE.

From the second and third constraints, we have:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (infx(x) might be equal to or greater than infx(z))
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (supx(x) might be equal to or less than supx(z))

These constraints doesn't necessarily mean that the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. It's possible that infx(x) > infx(z) or supx(x) < supx(z).

So, the relation between x and z could be:
- N (if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z))
- NE (if supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- NW (if supx(x) ≤ infx(z))

No, actually that's incorrect. Let me carefully reread the definition of these directional relations:

a N b if and only if:
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is strictly above b)
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b) (a's x-projection is contained within b's x-projection)

a NE b if and only if:
- supx(b) ≤ infx(a) (a is strictly to the right of b)
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is strictly above b)

a NW b if and only if:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is strictly to the left of b)
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is strictly above b)

So, with the constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) from our derivation, x can't be NW of z since we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for NW, which contradicts the constraint.

Similarly, with the constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), x can't be NE of z since we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for NE, which contradicts the constraint.

So, the only possible relation is N. But I made an error earlier. Let me double-check if x N z actually holds by rechecking the conditions for N:

a N b if and only if:
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is strictly above b)
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b) (a's x-projection is contained within b's x-projection)

From our constraints, we have:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x is strictly above z.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) aren't necessarily true from our derived constraints.

Actually, let me reanalyze. The constraints we derived were:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

The first constraint indicates that x is strictly above z.
The second constraint indicates that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means z can extend further to the left than x.
The third constraint indicates that supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means z can extend further to the right than x.

Given these constraints, the x-projection of x doesn't necessarily have to be fully contained within the x-projection of z. It could be, but it doesn't have to be. The only constraint is that we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

So, the relation between x and z could be N or NE. It can't be NW because NW requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we have infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Wait, let me recheck the definition of NE.

a NE b if and only if:
- supx(b) ≤ infx(a) (a is strictly to the right of b)
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is strictly above b)

Our constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (second part of NE satisfied)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (doesn't match the first part of NE, which requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x))

So, x can't be NE of z.

Let's also check B (Bounding box):

a B b if and only if:
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a)
- supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a)
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b)

Our constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (first part satisfied)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (second part satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (we don't know this, but we know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which doesn't give us information about infy(z))
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (we don't know this)

Since we don't have enough information to determine if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), we can't determine if x B z.

Let's also check the relation NW. 

a NW b if and only if:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is strictly to the left of b)
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is strictly above b)

Our constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (second part satisfied)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) not implied by our constraints (doesn't match the first part of NW)

So, x can't be NW of z.

OK, before I complete my derivation, let me double check the B relation:

a B b if and only if:
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a)
- supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a)
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b)

So with x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y N z, we have:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Let me combine these and check each of the possible relations.

Combining these, we get:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Based on these constraints, the relation between x and z could be:

1. N (North): 
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (satisfied)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (satisfied)

Wait a minute. The constraints for N are slightly different. Let's double check:

a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

So for x N z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (satisfied)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (satisfied)

So, based on our constraints, x N z is a valid relation.

Let's check if x NE z is also valid:

a NE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not satisfied from our constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z))
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied)

So, x NE z is not valid.

Let's check if x NW z is valid:

a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (not satisfied from our constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied)

So, x NW z is not valid.

Let's check if x B z is valid:

a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (satisfied)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (we don't know this from our constraints)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (we don't know this from our constraints)

Actually, the fact that supy(z) ≤ infy(x) actually implies that infy(x) ≥ supy(z) > infy(z). So, third part of the condition for B (infy(z) ≤ infy(x)) is satisfied. 

But we don't have any direct constraint on supy(x) and supy(z). So I can't determine if supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Hmm, let's take a step back. The fact that supy(z) ≤ infy(x) implies that region x is entirely above region z. This means that the relation can't be B, because B implies that x is within the bounding box of z. So x B z is not valid.

But wait, what about other relations like E, W, SE, SW, S? Let's check:

a E b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not satisfied from our constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z))
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied from the indirect constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (we don't know this from our constraints)

So, x E z is not valid.

a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (not satisfied from our constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied from the indirect constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (we don't know this from our constraints)

So, x W z is not valid.

a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not satisfied from our constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z))
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (contradicts our indirect constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x); if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then supy(x) ≤ infy(z) can't be true)

So, x SE z is not valid.

a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (not satisfied from our constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (contradicts our indirect constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x); if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then supy(x) ≤ infy(z) can't be true)

So, x SW z is not valid.

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (contradicts our indirect constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x); if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then supy(x) ≤ infy(z) can't be true)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (satisfied)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (satisfied)

So, x S z is not valid.

Ok, so far only N is valid. Let me re-check all of the derivations to make sure that I haven't made any arithmetic errors.

Let me be more careful and precise and consider a case by case analysis:

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is N of region z

What is the relation between region x and region z?

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we know that region x is strictly above region z. This rules out relations S, SW, W, NW, B, E, and SE because they all require some part of x to be at the same height or below z.

From infx(z) ≤ infx(x), we know that region z extends at least as far to the left as region x. This rules out NE because NE requires x to be strictly to the right of z.

From supx(x) ≤ supx(z), we know that region z extends at least as far to the right as region x. This rules out NW because NW requires x to be strictly to the left of z.

So, by process of elimination, the only relation left is N. Let's check if x N z holds by directly verifying the conditions:

a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied from our constraint)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (satisfied from our constraint)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (satisfied from our constraint)

So, the relation between region x and region z is N.

OK, I'm making a mistake here it seems. Let's be truly careful at this point. 

I'm not correctly applying the definition of the N relation:

a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

The last two pieces say:
infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

That means, for x N z:
infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

But that does appear to be what we deduced from our constraints, so the N relation does hold.

OK, but now let me wonder about other relations: like NW, or NE.

For x NE z:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

We have the second part, but for the first part, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which doesn't tell us anything about the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). So, we can't determine if x NE z is valid.

Actually, let me double check. We know that:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

This arrangement suggests that z and x overlap in the x-dimension, with z extending further to the left and right than x. If that's the case, then infx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supx(z) > infx(x). This would mean that the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for NE is not satisfied. So, x NE z is not valid.

For x NW z:
supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

We have the second part, but for the first part, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (assuming regions don't have zero width). So, x NW z is not valid.

For the other relations, we've already established that x is strictly above z, which rules out many relations.

So, it seems that N is the only valid relation between x and z.

Actually, wait. I think I might be being too strict. Let's think about what if regions were a grid:

If x B y means "x is inside the bounding box of y", and y N z means "y is to the north of z", then x B y can be in many different places within the bounds of y. x could be any shape and anywhere inside of y, and y can be any shape. Let me think through some cases: If x and y were identical, then since y is N of z, x would also be N of z. But we can't assume that the "B" relation requires that the regions to be identical.

If I picture a diagram where regions x, y, and z are actual shapes:
- If y is N of z, then y is entirely above z.
- If x is B of y, then x is entirely within the bounding box of y.

Given this, x could be anywhere within y's bounding box. It doesn't have to be in the northern part of y. This means that x could have several relations with z.

For example, if x is in the northwest part of y, then x could be NW of z.
If x is in the northeast part of y, then x could be NE of z.
If x is in the central northern part of y, then x would be N of z.

So, potentially, the relation between x and z could be N, NW, or NE.

Let me re-derive. I need to determine the constraints on the relationship of x and z given the following:
- x B y
- y N z

So given these, I want to determine what cardinal direction relation r must hold between x and z, which I write as x r z.

Let's be very concrete about the constraints here. First, given x B y, based on the definition of the B relation:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

No, now I'm being sloppy. Let's be more precise:

x B y if and only if
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

y N z if and only if
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, I can deduce:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Given that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), I can deduce that x is strictly above z. This, combined with the conditions infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), matches the definition of the N relation.

I should add, that since I'm only working with the min/max x and y coordinates, I'm effectively working with the bounding boxes of the regions, not the regions themselves. So, there might be more nuanced relationships between the actual regions (e.g. if regions are non-convex).

Actually, looking at the problem, we have the constraint that both x and y are in REG (they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk). So the regions are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries. This is telling me that both x and y shouldn't be sliced weird. From x B y, we can tell that all of x is contained within the bounding box of y. 

Also, I note that in my constraints, we have:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

OK, let me back up further. The definitions for the cardinal direction relations are defined in terms of the greatest lower bound and least upper bound of the projection of a region onto the x or y axes. These are just the bounding boxes of the regions. In this context, I'm checking how the bounding boxes of the regions relate to each other.

Let me verify once more:
- The condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ensures that the bounding box of x is strictly above the bounding box of z.
- The conditions infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ensure that the bounding box of x is horizontally contained within the bounding box of z.

This is precisely the definition of the N relation. So, x N z.

But it's worth noting that this is based on the bounding boxes of the regions and doesn't necessarily give the full picture of how the actual regions relate to each other.

Let me make one very strong point: we're given region x B of region y and region y N of region z. At no point are we given that the B relation is "strict", i.e. we're not told that x is smaller than y. It could be that x is exactly the same as y. 

So we have, in general:
If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then region x is N of region z.

And the relation between x and z is N (North). There are no other valid relations.

Wait, before I go, let me consider one final scenario.

Could the B relation mean something like "the bounding box of x is the same as the bounding box of y"? If that's the case, then the constraints from x B y would be:
- infx(y) = infx(x)
- supx(x) = supx(y)
- infy(y) = infy(x)
- supy(x) = supy(y)

Combining with y N z, we'd get:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) = infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) = infx(x)
- supx(x) = supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Yes, these still assert that x N z.

Or, could we have scenarios where only parts of the regions overlap? No, that's not the case with the B relation. The definition for B implies that the entire region x fits within the bounding box of region y.

One last note: could the B relation or N relation represent a scenario where the regions touch, but don't overlap? If that were the case, then there would be a B relation where, for example, the bounding boxes just touch on the corner. But then we still have the strict inequality supy(z) ≤ infy(y) from the N relation, indicating that there's a gap (in the y direction) between regions y and z.

Specifically, if supy(z) = infy(y), then regions y and z are "touching" in the vertical direction. But even in that case, we'd still have supy(z) = infy(y) ≤ infy(x), indicating that region x is still strictly above region z.

So we have:
If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then region x is N of region z.

Let me give this one more try. If I simplify the problem, all we're given is:
- x B y implies that region x is fully contained within the bounding box of region y.
- y N z implies that region y is strictly to the north of region z.

We want to determine the relationship of region x to region z.

Given that region x is within the bounding box of region y, and region y is strictly to the north of region z, we can deduce that region x must also be strictly to the north of region z (since the northernmost part of y is still to the north of z, and x is entirely within y). We also know, from the N relation, that the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z. Since the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y (from the B relation), it follows that the x-projection of x is also contained within the x-projection of z. This matches the definition of the N relation, so region x is N of region z.

So, my answer is: the relation between region x and region z is N (North).

Sorry, I think I'm not being careful enough. Let me derive one more time, very carefully. 

We have x B y, by the definition it means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the bottommost point of x is above the bottommost point of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (the topmost point of x is below the topmost point of y)

We have y N z, which means:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (the leftmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (the rightmost point of y is to the left of the rightmost point of z)

Combining these constraints, we can deduce:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (the leftmost point of z can be to the left of the leftmost point of x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (the rightmost point of x can be to the left of the rightmost point of z)

Okay, so region x is strictly above region z (from the first constraint). We also see that the leftmost point of z can be to the left of the leftmost point of x, and the rightmost point of z can be to the right of the rightmost point of x.

Let's check what relation(s) might be possible (bearing in mind that potentially multiple relations might hold simultaneously):

1. N (North): 
   Conditions: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   All three conditions are satisfied from our constraints. So, x N z is valid.

2. NE (North East): 
   Conditions: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The second condition is satisfied, but the first condition is not guaranteed. (On the contrary, we have infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)). So, x NE z is in general not valid. 

3. NW (North West): 
   Conditions: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The second condition is satisfied, but the first condition is in general not valid (on the contrary, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x)). So, x NW z is in general not valid.

4. B (Bounding box): 
   Conditions: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   First two conditions are satisfied, but the third condition doesn't hold. We have supy(z) ≤ infy(x) from our combined constraints which implies infy(x) ≥ supy(z) > infy(z). Since infy(x) > infy(z), the third condition doesn't hold. So, x B z is in general not valid.

5. S (South), SW (South West), SE (South East), E (East), W (West):
   Clearly, x is strictly above z, and can't be of any other relation than being in the northern part, so these don't hold.

So, the relation between region x and region z is N (North).

Wait, let's consider a different approach. Let's construct regions that satisfy x B y and y N z and see how x and z relate.

For simplicity, let's consider regions that are rectangles:

Let y be a rectangle with bottom-left corner at (0, 3) and top-right corner at (4, 6).
Let z be a rectangle with bottom-left corner at (-1, 0) and top-right corner at (5, 2).

Checking if y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y): 2 ≤ 3 (True)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y): -1 ≤ 0 (True)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z): 4 ≤ 5 (True)

So, y N z is satisfied.

Now, let's say x is a rectangle with bottom-left corner at (1, 4) and top-right corner at (3, 5).

Checking if x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x): 0 ≤ 1 (True)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y): 3 ≤ 4 (True)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x): 3 ≤ 4 (True)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y): 5 ≤ 6 (True)

So, x B y is satisfied.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x): 2 ≤ 4 (True)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x): -1 ≤ 1 (True)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z): 3 ≤ 5 (True)

This satisfies the conditions for N. So, x N z.

Is there a scenario where another relation could hold?

Actually, for the regions I constructed, the relation between x and z is N (North) exactly.

Let's try to find a scenario where another relation might hold. We've determined that x can't be S, SW, W, NW, B, E, or SE of z because x must be strictly above z. We've also determined that x can't be NE of z based on our derivation of the constraints.

I believe there is no other relation than N between x and z.

So, my final answer is: the relation between region x and region z is N (North).

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

These constraints match exactly with the N relation:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.
