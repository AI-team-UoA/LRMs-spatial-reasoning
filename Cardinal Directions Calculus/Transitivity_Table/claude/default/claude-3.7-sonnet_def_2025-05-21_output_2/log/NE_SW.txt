PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible cardinal directions between regions x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is SW of z.

Let's break this down:
- x is NE of y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is SW of z means: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now I need to determine what this tells us about the relationship between x and z.

From x is NE of y, we know:
supx(y) <= infx(x)
supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y is SW of z, we know:
supx(y) <= infx(z)
supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's think about what this means for the relative positions:

From these constraints:
- Does this tell us anything about the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z)?
  Since supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we know both x and z are to the right of y, but we can't determine which one is further right.

- Does this tell us anything about the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z)?
  Since supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we know both x and z are above y, but we can't determine which one is higher.

So, x could be in several positions relative to z:
- x could be NE of z
- x could be N of z
- x could be E of z
- x could be in the B (bounding box) of z
- x could be NW of z
- x could be SE of z

Let me check each possibility more carefully:

1. x could be NE of z: This happens if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   We don't have direct information about these from our constraints, so this is possible.

2. x could be N of z: This happens if infy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   Again, we don't have enough constraints to rule this out.

3. x could be E of z: This happens if supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   This is not ruled out by our constraints.

4. x could be in the B (bounding box) of z: This happens if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   This is also possible.

5. x could be NW of z: This happens if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Wait, this contradicts our constraint that supx(y) <= infx(x). Since supx(y) <= infx(z), if x were NW of z, then supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= infx(z), which means supx(y) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). But we also have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). But if infx(x) <= infx(z), x cannot be to the NW of z. So NW is NOT possible.

Actually, I think I made an error. Let me re-check.

- x is NE of y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is SW of z means: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For x to be NW of z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From our constraints:
- We have supx(y) <= infx(x), but we don't know how supx(x) relates to infx(z), so we can't rule out supx(x) <= infx(z).
- We have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), but we don't know how supy(z) relates to infy(x), so we can't rule out supy(z) <= infy(x).

So, actually, x could be NW of z.

6. x could be SE of z: This happens if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supx(y) <= infx(x), but we don't know the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). And we know supy(y) <= infy(z), but we don't know how supy(x) relates to infy(z).
   So, x could be SE of z.

7. x could be S of z: This happens if supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   We don't have direct constraints about these relationships, so this is possible.

8. x could be SW of z: This happens if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Again, not ruled out by our constraints.

9. x could be W of z: This happens if supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Not ruled out by our constraints.

Wait, let me reconsider this more carefully. I think I'm being too permissive and not fully considering the transitive nature of these relations.

I'll try with a different approach:

From the constraints:
- x is NE of y: The region x is strictly to the north-east of y.
- y is SW of z: The region y is strictly to the south-west of z.

Visually, if we place z at the center:
- y is to the south-west of z.
- x is to the north-east of y.

If y is to the south-west of z and x is to the north-east of y, then x is somewhere in the east to north range relative to z, but the exact direction depends on the specific positions.

Let me be more precise. I'll use the definitions of the cardinal direction relations provided:

For x to be NE of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

For y to be SW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (z is to the right of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is above y)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. x could be NE of z (supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)):
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
   - This doesn't tell us anything directly about supx(z) and infx(x).
   - Similarly, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
   - This doesn't tell us anything directly about supy(z) and infy(x).
   So, x could be NE of z.

2. x could be E of z (supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)):
   - We don't have constraints that rule this out.
   So, x could be E of z.

3. x could be SE of z (supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)):
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
   - We can't derive a relationship between supx(z) and infx(x) from this.
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
   - We can't derive a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from this.
   So, x could be SE of z.

4. x could be S of z (supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)):
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(z).
   - But we don't know how supy(x) relates to infy(z).
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
   - We can't derive a relationship between infx(z) and infx(x) or between supx(x) and supx(z) from this.
   So, S is possible.

Wait, I think I'm being too loose again. I need to be more careful with the transitive nature of the inequalities.

If x is NE of y, then:
supx(y) <= infx(x)
supy(y) <= infy(x)

If y is SW of z, then:
supx(y) <= infx(z)
supy(y) <= infy(z)

So, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

This doesn't give us direct inequalities between x and z, so we can't derive a specific relation. 

Let's consider all the possible positions for x relative to z, and check if they're consistent with our constraints.

First, we have a good visual overview: If y is SW of z, and x is NE of y, then x is in the general northward or eastward direction from z (or both). But the exact direction depends on the specific positions, and we need to check all possibilities:

1. x could be NE of z if:
   supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   Nothing in our constraints contradicts this, so it's possible.

2. x could be E of z if:
   supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   Nothing contradicts this, so it's possible.

3. x could be SE of z if:
   supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   Nothing contradicts this, so it's possible.

4. x could be S of z if:
   supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Nothing contradicts this, so it's possible.

5. x could be SW of z if:
   supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   But this might contradict our constraints. We know supx(y) <= infx(x) from "x is NE of y". If x is SW of z, then supx(x) <= infx(z). Combined, we get supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies supx(y) <= infx(z). And that's consistent with "y is SW of z", which tells us supx(y) <= infx(z).
   
   So, no contradiction. SW is possible.

Wait, let me re-check this:

If x is NE of y, then:
supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

If y is SW of z, then:
supx(y) <= infx(z) (z is to the right of y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is above y)

For x to be SW of z:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (z is to the right of x)
supy(x) <= infy(z) (z is above x)

Now, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x). Since infx(x) <= supx(x), we get supx(y) <= supx(x). And since infy(x) <= supy(x), we get supy(y) <= supy(x).

Combining with the constraints for x to be SW of z, we want to check if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From "y is SW of z", we have supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

So, supx(y) <= supx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).

Unfortunately, this doesn't directly tell us whether supx(x) <= infx(z) or not. Similarly, we have supy(y) <= supy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), but this doesn't tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

So, from our constraints, we can't rule out the possibility that x is SW of z.

Actually, scratch that. I think I'm overcomplicating this by trying to be too formal. Let's think visually.

If y is SW of z, it means y is both below and to the left of z.
If x is NE of y, it means x is both above and to the right of y.

Now, let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

- x can be directly above, directly to the right, or in the northeast quadrant relative to z. This corresponds to N, E, or NE.
- x can be inside the bounding box of z. This corresponds to B.
- x can be to the northwest of z (if it's much further north than right of y). This corresponds to NW.
- x can be to the southeast of z (if it's much further right than up from y). This corresponds to SE.
- x can be to the southwest of z (below and to the left of z). This corresponds to SW.
- x can be directly below z. This corresponds to S.
- x can be directly to the left of z. This corresponds to W.

Wait, I think I'm being too loose in my interpretation again. Let's be more precise by using the actual definitions provided for cardinal directions.

We're given:
- x is NE of y, which means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y is SW of z, which means supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

First, let's list all the cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- a B b: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a S b: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SW b: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a W b: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a NW b: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a N b: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a NE b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a E b: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a SE b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now, for each of these, let's check if it's possible for x to be in that relation to z, given our constraints.

1. x B z (infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)):
   Nothing in our constraints contradicts this, so it's possible.

2. x S z (supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)):
   We know supy(y) <= infy(z) from "y is SW of z" and supy(y) <= infy(x) from "x is NE of y".
   But we can't directly infer whether supy(x) <= infy(z) from these.
   Similarly, we can't infer anything from our constraints about infx(z) <= infx(x) or supx(x) <= supx(z).
   So, S is possible.

3. x SW z (supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)):
   From "y is SW of z", we know supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
   From "x is NE of y", we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
   Since infx(x) <= supx(x), we have supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
   But we can't infer from this whether supx(x) <= infx(z).
   Similarly, we can't infer whether supy(x) <= infy(z).
   So, SW is possible.

4. x W z (supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)):
   As before, we can't infer whether supx(x) <= infx(z) from our constraints.
   We also can't infer the other two conditions.
   So, W is possible.

5. x NW z (supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)):
   Again, we can't rule this out from our constraints.
   So, NW is possible.

6. x N z (supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)):
   We can't rule this out from our constraints.
   So, N is possible.

7. x NE z (supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)):
   We can't rule this out from our constraints.
   So, NE is possible.

8. x E z (supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)):
   We can't rule this out from our constraints.
   So, E is possible.

9. x SE z (supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)):
   We can't rule this out from our constraints.
   So, SE is possible.

I feel like I'm not making progress here. Let's take a step back and think more geometrically.

If y is SW of z, it means y is to the southwest (bottom-left) of z. If x is NE of y, it means x is to the northeast (top-right) of y.

Given these, let's consider possible positions of x relative to z:

- x could be below z (S or SE or SW).
- x could be above z (N or NE or NW).
- x could be to the left of z (W or NW or SW).
- x could be to the right of z (E or NE or SE).
- x could be inside the bounding box of z (B).

Let's see if we can refine this with our constraints.

If y is SW of z, and x is NE of y, then x is to the right and above y, while z is to the right and above y as well. This means that x and z are both in the top-right quadrant from y, but their relative position to each other is not determined.

So, x could be to the northwest, north, northeast, west, inside the bounding box, east, southwest, south, or southeast of z. Which is all possibilities! 

Let me try again a bit more carefully. We have:

- y is SW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

From these, we can see that:
- z is above and to the right of y.
- x is above and to the right of y.

But these constraints don't tell us the direct relationship between x and z. For all we know, x and z could be at the exact same position, or x could be anywhere above, below, to the left, or to the right of z, or in the middle of z.

I think, given the constraints, all cardinal directions are possible for x relative to z.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful and detailed in my analysis. Let's try again.

We have:
- y is SW of z, which means supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
- x is NE of y, which means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

Let's think about what these mean in terms of positions:
- "y is SW of z" means y is to the left (in terms of the x-axis) and below (in terms of the y-axis) relative to z.
- "x is NE of y" means x is to the right (in terms of the x-axis) and above (in terms of the y-axis) relative to y.

Let's consider each of the 9 possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. x B z (infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)):
   This means x is inside the bounding box of z. Our constraints don't contradict this, so B is possible.

2. x S z (supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)):
   This means x is directly below z. We know supy(y) <= infy(z) from "y is SW of z" and supy(y) <= infy(x) from "x is NE of y". This doesn't directly tell us about supy(x) and infy(z), so S is possible.

3. x SW z (supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)):
   This means x is to the left and below z. We know supx(y) <= infx(z) from "y is SW of z" and supx(y) <= infx(x) from "x is NE of y". Since infx(x) <= supx(x), we have supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). But this doesn't tell us about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z), so we can't rule out SW.

   However, let me think about this more carefully. If y is SW of z and x is NE of y, then x is moving away from z when moving from y to x. It seems intuitive that x shouldn't be to the southwest of z.

   Let's imagine a specific setup. We have a reference frame, and we can plot the regions. If z is at position (2, 2), and y is at (0, 0) (which satisfies y SW z), then x could be at (1, 1) (which satisfies x NE y). In this setting, x would be SW of z. So, SW remains possible.

   Actually I think I was wrong about this. The NE relation means (quoting): "a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)". So if we put these together:
   - y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
   - x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
   - x SW z (what we're testing): supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

   Since x is NE of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). Since y is SW of z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z). So we have:
   supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z)

   But this doesn't directly tell us about supx(x) and infx(z). So, it is possible that supx(x) > infx(z) which would mean x is not SW of z. Alternatively, supx(x) <= infx(z), in which case x is and could be SW of z.

   So, SW is possible.

4. x W z (supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)):
   This means x is directly to the left of z. Again, our constraints don't directly contradict this, so W is possible.

5. x NW z (supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)):
   This means x is to the left and above z. Our constraints don't directly contradict this, so NW is possible.

6. x N z (supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)):
   This means x is directly above z. Our constraints don't directly contradict this, so N is possible.

7. x NE z (supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)):
   This means x is to the right and above z. Our constraints don't directly contradict this, so NE is possible.

8. x E z (supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)):
   This means x is directly to the right of z. Our constraints don't directly contradict this, so E is possible.

9. x SE z (supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)):
   This means x is to the right and below z. Our constraints don't directly contradict this, so SE is possible.

So, as far as I can tell, all cardinal direction relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) are possible for x relative to z, given our constraints.

Wait, I'm not satisfied with this answer. Let's double check a few of these.

Let's consider 3. x SW z (supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)), and 4. x W z (supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)).

Now, if we look at our constraints again, we know:
- y is SW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(x) >= supy(y). And we know supy(y) <= infy(z). But these two constraints don't tell us the direct relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). Hence, x can be SW of z.

Similarly, for x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(x) >= supy(y). And we know supy(y) <= infy(z). Again, these don't tell us the direct relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), so x can be W of z.

But I'm wondering if I'm missing something. Let me double-check with another method.

Actually I had a different thought. Let's try to visualize this. If y is SW of z, and x is NE of y, I'll represent the positions in a 2D matrix:

```
    x-axis (increasing to the right)
    --------------------------->

```

Now, the constraint "y is SW of z" means supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z), so y is to the left and below of z.

And "x is NE of y" means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x), so x is to the right and above of y.

But x can be anywhere to the right and above of y, and this doesn't pin down its position relative to z. So let me try to reason about this from the basic definitions rather than exploring all the possibilities.

Actually, I think my original conclusion is correct: all cardinal directions are possible. But let me double-check by reasoning geometrically.

We have:
- y is SW of z, which means y is to the left and below z.
- x is NE of y, which means x is to the right and above y.

Given these, x must be to the right and above y, but its position relative to z is not fixed. Let's think of it this way: Imagine a plane with a coordinate system. If z is at (3, 3) and y is at (1, 1), then y is SW of z. Now, x could be at (2, 2), which is NE of y, and that would make x SW of z. Or x could be at (4, 4), which is NE of y, and that would make x NE of z. Similarly, x could be at various positions, like (4, 2) (which would make it E of z) or (2, 4) (which would make it N of z). And if x is so large that it includes the position of z, then x could be in the bounding box of z, making it B relative to z.

So, it seems like any of the 9 cardinal directions is possible for x relative to z, given our constraints.

Actually, I think I was missing something. I was only considering point-like regions, but in reality, regions can be 2D and have non-zero width and height. Let's try with 2D regions and see if that changes anything.

If y is SW of z, it means the top-right corner of y is to the bottom-left of the bottom-left corner of z. If x is NE of y, it means the bottom-left corner of x is to the top-right of the top-right corner of y.

With these, can x be W of z? For x to be W of z, the right edge of x must be to the left of the left edge of z. But we know the top-right corner of y is to the left of the left edge of z, and the bottom-left corner of x is to the right of the top-right corner of y. But the right edge of x is further right than its bottom-left corner, which doesn't tell us how it relates to the left edge of z. So, x can be W of z.

Similarly, I can check all the other cardinal directions and see that x could be in any of the 9 cardinal directions relative to z, given our constraints.

Ok, let's double check if all cardinal directions are possible.

First, let's make sure I'm using the correct definitions of these cardinal directions.

The direction "B" means that x is in the bounding box of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z)
- infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z)
- infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

The direction "N" means that:
- infy(x) >= supy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z)
- infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)

The direction "NE" means that:
- infx(x) >= supx(z)
- infy(x) >= supy(z)

The direction "E" means that:
- infx(x) >= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z)
- infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

The direction "SE" means that:
- infx(x) >= supx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The direction "S" means that:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z)
- infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)

The direction "SW" means that:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The direction "W" means that:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z)
- infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

The direction "NW" means that:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(x) >= supy(z)

Now, we have the following constraints:
- y is SW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

Let's check direction by direction:

1. B (x is inside the bounding box of z): Nothing in our constraints contradicts this.
2. N (x is directly north of z): Nothing in our constraints contradicts this.
3. NE (x is northeast of z): Nothing in our constraints contradicts this.
4. E (x is directly east of z): Nothing in our constraints contradicts this.
5. SE (x is southeast of z): Nothing in our constraints contradicts this.
6. S (x is directly south of z): Nothing in our constraints contradicts this.
7. SW (x is southwest of z): For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supx(y) <= infx(x) from "x is NE of y," which implies supx(y) <= supx(x). And from "y is SW of z," we have supx(y) <= infx(z). But these constraints don't directly tell us about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z), as supx(x) could be > infx(z). Similarly for supy(x) and infy(z). So SW is possible.
8. W (x is directly west of z): Nothing in our constraints contradicts this.
9. NW (x is northwest of z): Nothing in our constraints contradicts this.

So all 9 cardinal directions are possible for x relative to z. Let me double check to make sure this is right.

Actually, let's try to think about it more geometrically. Again, we have:
- y is SW of z, which means y is to the left and below z.
- x is NE of y, which means x is to the right and above y.

For x to be SW of z, both of the following should be true:
- x is to the left of z (i.e., the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z).
- x is below z (i.e., the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z).

But we know x is to the right and above y, and y is to the left and below z. So doesn't it seem like x should be moving "away" from SW, more to the NE? How could x be SW of z if it's moving in the NE direction from y?

Actually, the issue here is that "moving to the NE" is relative to the starting point. While x is moving to the NE from y, that doesn't define its final position in the coordinate system. As long as y is far enough SW of z, x can still be SW of z even after moving NE from y. To be more concrete, imagine:
- y is at (0, 0).
- z is at (10, 10).
- x is at (2, 2).

In this scenario, x is NE of y, but x is still SW of z, because x is to the left and below z.

Given this, it seems like all 9 cardinal directions are possible for x relative to z.

Alright, let's go with that. But I'll construct an example for each direction to confirm:

1. B (x is inside the bounding box of z): z is at (5, 5) with a width and height of 4, so z extends from (3, 3) to (7, 7). y is at (1, 1) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.5, 1.5). And x is at (4, 4) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (3, 3) to (5, 5), which is inside the bounding box of z.

2. N (x is directly north of z): z is at (5, 5) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 4) to (6, 6). y is at (1, 1) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.5, 1.5). And x is at (5, 8) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 7) to (6, 9), which is directly north of z.

3. NE (x is northeast of z): z is at (5, 5) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 4) to (6, 6). y is at (1, 1) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.5, 1.5). And x is at (8, 8) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (7, 7) to (9, 9), which is to the northeast of z.

4. E (x is directly east of z): z is at (5, 5) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 4) to (6, 6). y is at (1, 1) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.5, 1.5). And x is at (8, 5) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (7, 4) to (9, 6), which is directly east of z.

5. SE (x is southeast of z): z is at (5, 5) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 4) to (6, 6). y is at (1, 1) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.5, 1.5). And x is at (8, 2) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (7, 1) to (9, 3), which is to the southeast of z.

6. S (x is directly south of z): z is at (5, 5) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 4) to (6, 6). y is at (1, 1) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.5, 1.5). And x is at (5, 2) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 1) to (6, 3), which is directly south of z.

7. SW (x is southwest of z): z is at (5, 5) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 4) to (6, 6). y is at (1, 1) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (0.5, 0.5) to (1.5, 1.5). And x is at (2, 2) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (1.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 2.5), which is to the southwest of z.

Wait, I made a mistake. For x to be SW of z, the rightmost point of x (supx(x)) is to the left of the leftmost point of z (infx(z)). In my example, supx(x) = 2.5 and infx(z) = 4, so supx(x) < infx(z) and the SW relation is satisfied. But for x to be NE of y, the leftmost point of x (infx(x)) is to the right of the rightmost point of y (supx(y)). In my example, infx(x) = 1.5 and supx(y) = 1.5, so infx(x) = supx(y) and not infx(x) > supx(y). So, the NE relation is not strictly satisfied.

Let me adjust my examples.

7. SW (x is southwest of z): z is at (5, 5) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 4) to (6, 6). y is at (0, 0) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5). And x is at (2, 2) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (1.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 2.5). This satisfies: x is NE of y (infx(x) = 1.5 > supx(y) = 0.5, and infy(x) = 1.5 > supy(y) = 0.5) and x is SW of z (supx(x) = 2.5 < infx(z) = 4, and supy(x) = 2.5 < infy(z) = 4).

8. W (x is directly west of z): z is at (5, 5) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 4) to (6, 6). y is at (0, 3) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (-0.5, 2.5) to (0.5, 3.5). And x is at (2, 5) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (1.5, 4.5) to (2.5, 5.5). This satisfies: x is NE of y (infx(x) = 1.5 > supx(y) = 0.5, and infy(x) = 4.5 > supy(y) = 3.5) and x is W of z (supx(x) = 2.5 < infx(z) = 4, and infy(z) = 4 < infy(x) = 4.5 < supy(z) = 6, and infy(z) = 4 < supy(x) = 5.5 < supy(z) = 6).

9. NW (x is northwest of z): z is at (5, 5) with a width and height of 2, so it extends from (4, 4) to (6, 6). y is at (0, 0) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5). And x is at (2, 8) with a width and height of 1, so it extends from (1.5, 7.5) to (2.5, 8.5). This satisfies: x is NE of y (infx(x) = 1.5 > supx(y) = 0.5, and infy(x) = 7.5 > supy(y) = 0.5) and x is NW of z (supx(x) = 2.5 < infx(z) = 4, and infy(x) = 7.5 > supy(z) = 6).

So, all 9 cardinal directions are possible for x relative to z. 

Actually, I think I can just directly use a graphical representation to make this clearer. Let me define the smallest region that contains all points in the NE of y and see how it relates to z.

OK I think I have all the possible relationships:
1. N (North): x is directly north of z.
2. NE (Northeast): x is to the northeast of z.
3. E (East): x is directly east of z.
4. SE (Southeast): x is to the southeast of z.
5. S (South): x is directly south of z.
6. SW (Southwest): x is to the southwest of z.
7. W (West): x is directly west of z.
8. NW (Northwest): x is to the northwest of z.
9. B (Bounding Box): x is inside the bounding box of z.

Given that:
- x is NE of y
- y is SW of z

All 9 cardinal direction relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) are possible for x relative to z.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

Let me analyze the possible relations between regions x and z:

When x is NE of y, it means x is to the right and above y.
When y is SW of z, it means y is to the left and below z.

Given these constraints, x could be in any of the following positions relative to z:

1. N: x could be directly north of z
2. NE: x could be northeast of z
3. E: x could be directly east of z 
4. SE: x could be southeast of z
5. S: x could be directly south of z
6. SW: x could be southwest of z
7. W: x could be directly west of z
8. NW: x could be northwest of z
9. B: x could be inside the bounding box of z

All cardinal direction relations are possible because knowing that x is NE of y and y is SW of z doesn't constrain the position of x relative to z in any way. The relationship depends on exactly how far x is from y in the northeast direction compared to how far z is from y in the northeast direction.
