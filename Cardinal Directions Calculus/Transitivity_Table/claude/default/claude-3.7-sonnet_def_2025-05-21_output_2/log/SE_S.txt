PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this carefully by using the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

Given information:
- x is SE of y: This means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
- y is S of z: This means supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

We need to determine all possible relations between regions x and z.

Let's start by using what we know to establish constraints on the coordinates of x and z:

From x is SE of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)  [x is to the east of y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y)  [x is to the south of y]

From y is S of z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)  [y is to the south of z]
- infx(z) <= infx(y)  [y's western bound is at or east of z's western bound]
- supx(y) <= supx(z)  [y's eastern bound is at or west of z's eastern bound]

Now, let's try to derive the constraints between x and z:

For the east-west relationship between x and z:
- We know that supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x is SE of y]
- And we know that supx(y) <= supx(z) [from y is S of z]
- But these don't directly tell us the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z)
- We also know that infx(z) <= infx(y) [from y is S of z]
- But we don't have a direct relationship between infx(y) and infx(x)

So for the east-west relationship, we don't have enough constraints to determine if x is definitely east, west, or overlapping with z.

For the north-south relationship between x and z:
- We know that supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x is SE of y]
- And we know that supy(y) <= infy(z) [from y is S of z]
- So, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z)
- This means that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is south of z, so x is in S, SW, or SE relation with z.

So from the north-south perspective, x must be south of z. But from the east-west perspective, we don't have enough constraints to narrow it down further. 

Let's see if we can make more deductions by considering specific configurations.

From the given:
- x is SE of y, so x is to the east and south of y
- y is S of z, so y is to the south of z

Let's consider different possible positions of x in relation to z:

1. If x is directly south of z (S):
   - This can happen if x is aligned with z in the east-west direction, meaning infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which aligns with the S relation
   - So, S is a possible relation.

2. If x is southeast of z (SE):
   - This means x is both south and east of z
   - South: supy(x) <= infy(z) [already established]
   - East: supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - Is this possible? Let's check if our givens allow this.
   - We know infx(x) >= supx(y) [from x is SE of y]
   - And we know supx(y) <= supx(z) [from y is S of z]
   - So, supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - But this doesn't tell us if supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - So, SE is a possible relation if supx(z) <= infx(x).

3. If x is southwest of z (SW):
   - This means x is both south and west of z
   - South: supy(x) <= infy(z) [already established]
   - West: supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - Is this possible? Let's check if our givens allow this.
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x is SE of y]
   - And we know infx(z) <= infx(y) [from y is S of z]
   - These don't directly give a relation between supx(x) and infx(z)
   - So, SW is a possible relation if supx(x) <= infx(z).

Actually, I realize I might have been making this unnecessarily complicated. Let's simplify.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is S of z

From the definitions:
- For x to be SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- For y to be S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

We need to check all possible relations between x and z: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE.

Let's think about the constraints and see which relations are consistent with them.

From the givens, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z)
  This means that region x is below region z, so the relation can only be one of S, SW, or SE.

Let's check each of these:

1. S (South):
   - For x to be S of z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We already know supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are consistent with the givens.
   
   From x is SE of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
   From y is S of z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y).
   So, infx(z) <= infx(y). But this doesn't tell us if infx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   From x is SE of y, we don't have a direct constraint on supx(x).
   From y is S of z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z).
   But this doesn't tell us if supx(x) <= supx(z).
   
   So, S is a possible relation if both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are true.

2. SW (South West):
   - For x to be SW of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We already know supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We need to check if supx(x) <= infx(z) is consistent with the givens.
   
   Wait, this can be contradictory. From x is SE of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
   From y is S of z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y).
   So, if infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), then we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
   This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) for the SW relation.
   
   Wait, I might have made a mistake. Let's double-check. For SW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). From our derived chain, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), so we can't guarantee that supx(x) <= infx(z). SW is only possible if there's no overlap in the x-coordinate, but from our constraints, it seems like there could be.

   Actually, let's be more careful. 
   From x is SE of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
   From y is S of z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y).
   These don't directly tell us the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). So, SW is still a possible relation.

   Oh, but we have another chain. From x SE of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
   From y S of z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z).
   So we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't tell us the relation between infx(x) and supx(z), so both SW and S remain possibilities.

I'm making this too complicated. Let's take a step back and think more clearly.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is S of z

If we visualize this, y is directly south of z, and x is southeast of y. This means x is to the east of y and south of y. Now, x could be:
1. South of z (S) if x is aligned with z in the east-west direction.
2. Southeast of z (SE) if x is to the east of z.
3. Southwest of z (SW) if x is to the west of z.

Let's check if all of these are actually possible using the constraints.

From the constraints:
- For x to be SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- For y to be S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's try to visualize specific configurations to see if each of the possible relations (S, SE, SW) can actually occur.

1. S (South):
   Imagine a scenario where infx(z) = infx(x) and supx(z) = supx(x). Is this consistent with the constraints?
   - For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - For y to be S of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
   If infx(z) = infx(x), then for both constraints to be satisfied, we need infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), which is possible.
   Similarly, if supx(z) = supx(x), both constraints can be satisfied.
   So, S is a possible relation.

2. SE (Southeast):
   Imagine a scenario where supx(z) < infx(x). Is this consistent with the constraints?
   - For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - For y to be S of z, we need supx(y) <= supx(z).
   So, supx(y) <= supx(z) < infx(x), which means supx(y) < infx(x), satisfying the constraint for x to be SE of y.
   The other constraints can also be satisfied in this configuration.
   So, SE is a possible relation.

3. SW (Southwest):
   Imagine a scenario where supx(x) < infx(z). Is this consistent with the constraints?
   - For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(y) < supx(x) (assuming x has some width).
   - For y to be S of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
   So, we have supx(y) < supx(x) < infx(z) <= infx(y).
   This gives supx(y) < infx(y), which is a contradiction if y is a solid region.
   
   Hold on. Let's be more careful. What I mean is that for a region y, we should have infx(y) <= supx(y) because it has a width. If y is S of z then z and y are aligned in the east-west direction.

Actually, sorry for the confusion. Let me try again with a clearer approach.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is S of z

Let's think about the possible positions of region x with respect to region z, given the constraints.

The defining constraint of x being SE of y is:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

And the defining constraint of y being S of z is:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) [y is to the south of z]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) [y and z are aligned in the east-west direction]

Now, let's derive the constraints for the relationship between x and z.

Since supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we have supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x is to the south of z, which narrows the possible relations to S, SW, or SE.

Let's check each of these:

1. S (South):
   For x to be S of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) [already established]
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) [x and z are aligned in the east-west direction]
   
   From y is S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
   From x is SE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
   
   Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
   This doesn't directly tell us if infx(z) <= infx(x) (which is required for S), but it's a consistent scenario.
   
   Moreover, we don't have direct constraints on supx(x) in relation to supx(z) (which is also required for S).
   
   So, S is a possible relation if both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are true, and there's no direct contradiction from the givens.

2. SE (Southeast):
   For x to be SE of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) [already established]
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of z]
   
   From y is S of z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z).
   From x is SE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
   
   If supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), then it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x) (which means x is to the east of z). But it's also possible that supx(z) > infx(x) (which means x and z overlap in the east-west direction).
   
   So, SE is a possible relation if supx(z) <= infx(x) is true, and there's no direct contradiction from the givens.

3. SW (Southwest):
   For x to be SW of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) [already established]
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) [x is to the west of z]
   
   From y is S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).
   From x is SE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
   
   Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
   
   Let's think further. For SW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But from the given constraints, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of y. And since y is to the south of z with an alignment in the east-west direction, it's hard to see how x could be to the west of z.
   
   Actually, I've made a mistake in the above reasoning. The constraint supx(y) <= infx(x) means x is to the east of y, not that x is entirely to the east of y. Similarly, the constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) means y and z are aligned in the east-west direction, not that y is directly below z.
   
   Let me reconsider the SW relation more carefully.

Wait, I need to think again. The definition of "x is SE of y" means x is entirely to the east and south of y. If supx(y) <= infx(x), it means the easternmost point of y is still to the west of the westernmost point of x, which does indeed mean x is entirely to the east of y. Similarly, for x to be SE of y, x should be entirely to the south of y.

Now, for SW: We need supx(x) <= infx(z). From the constraints, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's western bound is at or east of z's western bound).

These don't directly tell us if supx(x) <= infx(z), and I can construct an example where supx(x) > infx(z), so SW is not automatically ruled out by the given constraints.

So, in summary, the possible relations between region x and region z could be S, SE, or SW.

Let me double-check each possibility:

1. S (South):
   - For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We already established supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From y is S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
   - From x is SE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - If infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), then I can construct a scenario where infx(z) <= infx(x) is true.
   - The constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) doesn't have a direct contradiction from the givens.
   - So, S is a possible relation.

2. SE (Southeast):
   - For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We already established supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From y is S of z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z).
   - From x is SE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - If supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), then I can construct a scenario where supx(z) <= infx(x) is true.
   - So, SE is a possible relation.

3. SW (Southwest):
   - For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - We already established supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From y is S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).
   - From x is SE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - Now, if supx(y) <= infx(x), then it's hard to have supx(x) <= infx(z) because infx(z) <= infx(y) (the easternmost point of x would be to the east of y, which would be to the east of the leftmost point of z).

But wait, that's not necessarily true. I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let's set up an example to check if SW is really possible.

Let's say:
- z is at (0, 0) with width and height 1
- y is at (0, -2) with width and height 1 (so y is S of z)
- x is at (-2, -4) with width and height 1

With these coordinates:
- infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1, infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1
- infy(y) = -2, supy(y) = -1, infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 1
- infy(x) = -4, supy(x) = -3, infx(x) = -2, supx(x) = -1

Checking the given constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
  -1 <= 0, 0 <= 0, and 1 <= 1. All are true.
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
  Hmm, 1 <= -2 is false. So this example doesn't work.

Wait, I think I made a slip-up: if X is SE of Y (supx(y) <= infx(x)) then Y is NW of X, not the other way around.

Let me try a different example:
- z is at (0, 0) with width and height 1
- y is at (0, -2) with width and height 1 (so y is S of z)
- x is at (2, -4) with width and height 1

With these coordinates:
- infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1, infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1
- infy(y) = -2, supy(y) = -1, infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 1
- infy(x) = -4, supy(x) = -3, infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3

Checking the given constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
  -1 <= 0, 0 <= 0, and 1 <= 1. All are true.
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
  1 <= 2 and -3 <= -2. Both are true.

Now, let me check if x is SW of z:
- For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z).
  -3 <= 0 is true, but 3 <= 0 is false. So x is not SW of z in this example.

Let me modify the example to try to create an instance where x is SW of z.

Actually, let's try to visualize this more abstractly:
- z is the reference region.
- y is directly south of z, aligned with z in the east-west direction.
- x is southeast of y, meaning it's to the east and south of y.

Given these positions, x is going to be to the south and east of z. It's not clear how x could be southwest of z.

Let me re-examine the constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).

For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z).

From the constraints, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z). This part of the SW condition is satisfied.

But for the other part, supx(x) <= infx(z), we need to check if it's consistent with the given constraints. From the constraints, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y).

If supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's western bound is at or east of z's western bound), then it seems difficult to have supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z). But difficult is not the same as impossible, so let's actually construct an example.

Let's think of some small concrete example:
For simplicity, I'll describe these regions using bounding rectangles and the coordinates of the bottom-left and top-right corners:

z: (0, 0) to (3, 3)
y: (1, -3) to (2, -1)
x: (3, -6) to (4, -4)

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- y: infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 2, infy(y) = -3, supy(y) = -1
- x: infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = -6, supy(x) = -4

Checking the constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
  -1 <= 0, 0 <= 1, and 2 <= 3. All are true.
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
  2 <= 3 and -4 <= -3. Both are true.

Now, let's check if x is SW of z:
- For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z).
  -4 <= 0 is true, but 4 <= 0 is false. So x is not SW of z in this example either.

Actually, thinking more about, SW feels like it should be a logical impossibility.

If:
- x is SE of y
- y is S of z

Then:
- x is to the east of y
- y is aligned with z in the east-west direction

Given these, it's hard to see how x could be to the west of z. Let me think if we can make a formal argument.

Argument:
- From x is SE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
- From y is S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).
- Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
- Since regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, they have non-zero width. This means infx(y) < supx(y) for any region y.
- So, infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which gives infx(z) < infx(x).
- For x to be SW of z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z). Given that infx(x) <= supx(x) (regions have non-zero width), if infx(z) < infx(x), then it would be impossible to have supx(x) <= infx(z).

Thus, it's formally impossible for x to be SW of z given that x is SE of y and y is S of z.

So we've narrowed it down to S or SE for the possible relation between x and z.

Actually, let me verify that S is a possibility:

Example:
z: (0, 0) to (3, 3)
y: (0, -3) to (3, -1)
x: (0, -6) to (3, -4)

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- y: infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = -3, supy(y) = -1
- x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = -6, supy(x) = -4

Checking the constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
  -1 <= 0, 0 <= 0, and 3 <= 3. All are true.
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
  3 <= 0 is false. So this doesn't work.

Oops. Actually, for x to be SE of y, we need to move it a little east:

Let me try another example:
z: (0, 0) to (3, 3)
y: (0, -3) to (3, -1)
x: (4, -6) to (7, -4)

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- y: infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = -3, supy(y) = -1
- x: infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 7, infy(x) = -6, supy(x) = -4

Checking the constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
  -1 <= 0, 0 <= 0, and 3 <= 3. All are true.
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
  3 <= 4 and -4 <= -3. Both are true.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is neither B, N, NE, E, NW, W, nor SW of z based on the constraints.
- For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  -4 <= 0 is true, 0 <= 4 is true, but 7 <= 3 is false. So x is not S of z in this example.
- For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
  -4 <= 0 is true, and 3 <= 4 is true. So x is SE of z in this example.

So S isn't the relation in the example, but SE is. However, the definition of S just requires the region to be below the reference region and aligned in the east-west direction. If I adjust the coordinates, I should be able to find an example where x is S of z. Let's try.

Let me try a different example to demonstrate S:
z: (0, 0) to (5, 3)
y: (1, -3) to (4, -1)
x: (2, -6) to (3, -4)

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- y: infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = -3, supy(y) = -1
- x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = -6, supy(x) = -4

Checking the constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
  -1 <= 0, 0 <= 1, and 4 <= 5. All are true.
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
  4 <= 2 is false. So this doesn't work.

OK let's try again!

Let me try a different example to demonstrate S:
z: (0, 0) to (5, 3)
y: (1, -3) to (2, -1)
x: (1.5, -6) to (1.7, -4)

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- y: infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 2, infy(y) = -3, supy(y) = -1
- x: infx(x) = 1.5, supx(x) = 1.7, infy(x) = -6, supy(x) = -4

Checking the constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
  -1 <= 0, 0 <= 1, and 2 <= 5. All are true.
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
  2 <= 1.5 is false. STILL doesn't work.

I think I've been making a conceptual error. SE of y does not require the entirety of x to be east of y. It just means that x is to the southeast of y. Let's try a slightly different approach.

First, let's redefine cardinal directions from the reference:

From the definition in the problem statement, a single-tile cardinal direction such as SE for regions a and b (with b as the reference) is defined as:
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

And:
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

Now, let's think through this again.

Given:
- x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

We need to find the possible relations between x and z.

From the givens, we can deduce:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x is SE of y]
- supy(y) <= infy(z) [from y is S of z]
- So, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

This narrows down the possible relations to S, SW, or SE.

For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). Given that supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x is SE of y] and infx(z) <= infx(y) [from y is S of z], it's not immediate that supx(x) <= infx(z) must be true. However, let's see if we can construct a counter-example (an instance where supx(x) <= infx(z)).

Hmm, actually, regions are supposed to be homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This means they're connected and have a non-zero width, so infx(y) < supx(y) for any region y.

Given that supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x is SE of y] and infx(z) <= infx(y) [from y is S of z], we get: infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x).

So, infx(z) < infx(x), which means infx(z) is less than infx(x). For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But we just established that infx(z) < infx(x), and since regions have non-zero width, infx(x) < supx(x). So, infx(z) < supx(x), which contradicts the requirement for SW.

Actually, now I understand the confusion I was having. I was thinking of SE of y as a direction, not as a binary relation. To say x is SE of y means that x is to the southeast of the center of y, not that the entirety of x is to the right and below of y. But, from the definition, the single-tile cardinal direction relation is a binary relation between regions.

I'll try again more carefully.

Given:
- x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [already established]
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) [x and z are aligned in the east-west direction]

Given that:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [from y is S of z]
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x is SE of y]
We get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). So, infx(z) <= infx(x) is true.

But for supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have immediate constraints. It's possible that supx(x) > supx(z), in which case x would not be S of z. But it's also possible that supx(x) <= supx(z), in which case x could be S of z.

So, S remains a potential relation.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [already established]
- supx(x) <= infx(z) [x is to the west of z]

But, as I argued before, with infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) and the fact that regions have non-zero width, it's impossible to have supx(x) <= infx(z).

So, SW is not a possible relation.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [already established]
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of z]

Given that:
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [from y is S of z]
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x is SE of y]
We have supx(y) <= min(supx(z), infx(x)), but this doesn't directly tell us if supx(z) <= infx(x).

It's possible that supx(z) > infx(x), in which case x would not be SE of z. But it's also possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), in which case x could be SE of z.

So, SE remains a potential relation.

In summary, the possible relations between region x and region z are S or SE.

But wait, I'm realizing another mistake I made. The definitions of cardinal direction relations I referred to are not the ones given in the problem statement.

Let's use the correct definitions:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Given:
- x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [which we established]
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

For the condition infx(z) <= infx(x):
- From y is S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).
- From x is SE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
- We can't directly derive infx(z) <= infx(x) from these constraints.

I'm not sure if this is a rigorous argument, but I'll try to be more careful:

Given infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), we know that infx(z) is less than or equal to infx(y), which is less than or equal to supx(y) (as regions have non-zero width), which is less than or equal to infx(x). This gives us infx(z) <= infx(x).

For the condition supx(x) <= supx(z):
- From y is S of z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z).
- From x is SE of y, we don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) in relation to supx(y) or supx(z).
- So the question is, can supx(x) be or not be less than to supx(z)? Both cases are possible.

So, S is a possible relation.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [which we established]
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

From y is S of z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z).
From x is SE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).

These constraints don't directly tell us the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). It's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), making x SE of z, or that supx(z) > infx(x), in which case x is not SE of z.

So, SE is a possible relation.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [which we established]
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

Given that:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [from y is S of z]
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x is SE of y]
There's a challenge in showing supx(x) <= infx(z) due to the constraints infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).

But let's be more rigorous about my previous argument. The constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) means z's western bound is at or to the west of y's western bound. The constraint supx(y) <= infx(x) means y's eastern bound is at or to the west of x's western bound.

But what can we say about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z)? If infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) < supx(y) (as regions have non-zero width) and supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(x) < supx(x) (again, regions have non-zero width), then we get infx(z) < supx(x). This would make supx(x) <= infx(z) false, which means x is not SW of z.

Thus, SW is not a possible relation.

So it looks like only S or SE are possible.

Actually let me make one more check. Assuming regions have non-zero width and height, we have infx(y) < supx(y) and infy(y) < supy(y).

Given:
- x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [already shown to be true]
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

For infx(z) <= infx(x), we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [from y is S of z]
- infx(y) < supx(y) [regions have non-zero width]
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x is SE of y]
This gives us infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) < infx(x). Thus, infx(z) <= infx(x) is true.

For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have a similar chain of constraints. It's possible to have supx(x) <= supx(z) or supx(x) > supx(z). So, S is a possible relation.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [already shown to be true]
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

Given:
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [from y is S of z]
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x is SE of y]
These tell us that supx(y) is less than or equal to both supx(z) and infx(x). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). It's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x) or supx(z) > infx(x). So, SE is a possible relation.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [already shown to be true]
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

The constraints infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x) give us infx(z) < supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, SW is not a possible relation. 

But I realize that this approach is flawed because regions don't have to be rectangles. Regions can have any shape, as long as they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. The "projection" of a region onto an axis is the set of coordinates on that axis that the region covers. For example, the projection of a region onto the x-axis gives the range of x-coordinates that the region covers. That's how infx(a) and supx(a) are defined.

I do, however, believe that both points of view can still, in practive, make the case for SW to be false.

So, after careful analysis, I believe the possible relations between region x and region z are S and SE.

Actually, I want to make a clear-cut example for each of S and SE. Let me do it by the explicit definition of these relations.

For S:
z: (0, 0) to (4, 3)
y: (1, -3) to (3, -1)
x: (2, -6) to (3, -4)

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- y: infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = -3, supy(y) = -1
- x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = -6, supy(x) = -4

Checking the constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z):
  -1 <= 0, 0 <= 1, and 3 <= 4. All are true.
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y):
  3 <= 2 is false. This doesn't work.

OK let me try once again. And this time, I just need to adjust one parameter.

For S:
z: (0, 0) to (4, 3)
y: (1, -3) to (3, -1)
x: (3.5, -6) to (4, -4)

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- y: infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = -3, supy(y) = -1
- x: infx(x) = 3.5, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = -6, supy(x) = -4

Checking the constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z):
  -1 <= 0, 0 <= 1, and 3 <= 4. All are true.
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y):
  3 <= 3.5 and -4 <= -3. Both are true.

Now, let's check if x is S of z:
- For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z):
  -4 <= 0, 0 <= 3.5, and 4 <= 4. All are true.

Great! This is an example where x is S of z.

Now, let's create an example for SE:

For SE:
z: (0, 0) to (3, 3)
y: (1, -3) to (2, -1)
x: (4, -6) to (5, -4)

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- y: infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 2, infy(y) = -3, supy(y) = -1
- x: infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = -6, supy(x) = -4

Checking the constraints:
- For y to be S of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z):
  -1 <= 0, 0 <= 1, and 2 <= 3. All are true.
- For x to be SE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y):
  2 <= 4 and -4 <= -3. Both are true.

Now, let's check if x is SE of z:
- For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x):
  -4 <= 0 and 3 <= 4. Both are true.

Great! This is an example where x is SE of z.

So, as we've shown, both S and SE are possible relations between region x and region z.

Let me double check my work. My final answer is that the possible directions between region x and region z can be S or SE.

This makes intuitive sense. If y is directly below z, and x is to the southeast of y, then x is either also directly below z (if z is wide enough to cover the east-west spread of x) or it's to the southeast of z (if x extends further east than z does).

Actually, let me really make sure these are the only relations. We've already shown that S, SE, and SW are the only candidates. We've proven that SW is not possible.

Let me check if any of the other directions are possible:
- B (bounding box): This would require x to be fully inside z, but given that y is S of z and x is SE of y, x is below z. So, B is not possible.
- N, NE, NW: These would require x to be to the north of z, but given that y is S of z and x is SE of y, x is to the south of z. So, N, NE, and NW are not possible.
- E: This would require x to be to the east of z and aligned in the north-south direction. But given that y is S of z and x is SE of y, x is to the south of z. So, E is not possible.
- W: This would require x to be to the west of z and aligned in the north-south direction. But given that y is S of z and x is SE of y, x is to the south of z. So, W is not possible.

OK so I was right before. The only possible relations between region x and region z are S and SE.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is S of z.

Let me analyze what these given relations tell us:

1) x is SE of y means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

2) y is S of z means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) [y is to the south of z]
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) [z and y are aligned in the east-west direction]
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) [z and y are aligned in the east-west direction]

From these, I can deduce:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z)
This means x must be to the south of z.

For the east-west relationship:
- From infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), I can derive that infx(z) <= infx(x)
- But there's no direct constraint between supx(x) and supx(z)

Let's check each possible relation:

For S relation:
- We already established supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We derived infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) is possible but not guaranteed

For SE relation:
- We already established supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible but not guaranteed

All other relations are impossible given the constraints.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SE
