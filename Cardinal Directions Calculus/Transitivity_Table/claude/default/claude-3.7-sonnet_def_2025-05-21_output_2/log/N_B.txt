PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We're given two relationships:
1. x N y (region x is North of region y)
2. y B z (region y is in the Bounding box of region z)

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relationships that could exist between x and z.

From the definition of N:
- x N y means supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

From the definition of B:
- y B z means infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's combine these to determine constraints between x and z:

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) 
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y B z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z) => (we can't immediately derive a direct constraint between infy(x) and supy(z))
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y) => infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) => supx(x) <= supx(z)

From these constraints, we can't determine a unique cardinal direction relationship between x and z. We know that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which means x is within the x-projection of z. But the y-relationship is unclear because we only know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), but we don't know the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

Let me analyze the possible cases:

Case 1: supy(z) <= infy(x)
If this is true, then x is strictly North of z, so x N z.

Case 2: supy(z) > infy(x)
In this case, x and z overlap in the y-dimension, so x is not strictly North of z. Given that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), x could be in the Bounding box of z, so x B z.

Let me think about this more carefully. 

I know that y is within the Bounding box of z, and x is North of y. This means that x could be:
- North of z (if x is entirely above z).
- Partially inside the Bounding box of z, in the North part of z (if x partially overlaps with z in the y-dimension).

Let's reconsider the constraints on the y-dimension:

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y B z:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This doesn't tell us about the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z) directly. 

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is North of z (x N z).
If infy(x) <= supy(z), then x might overlap with z in the y-dimension or they may just touch.

For x to be in the Bounding box of z, I need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which I already know)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which I already know)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (not yet determined)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (not yet determined)

So, the additional constraints I need to check are infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Actually, I've been approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the constraints directly.

I know:
1. x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2. y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's think of this in terms of tile relationships. If region x is North of y, it means x is entirely in the N tile of y. If y is in the Bounding box of z, it's entirely contained within z.

So, the question is: if x is in the N tile of y, and y is inside z, where can x be relative to z?

Let's think of the problem geometrically. If y is inside the Bounding box of z, then z at least covers the same area as y and may extend beyond y in any or all directions. If x is North of y, then x is strictly above y. 

So, where can x be relative to z?

Given that z covers at least the same area as y:
- If z doesn't extend past the northern boundary of y, then x is strictly North of z (x N z).
- If z extends past the northern boundary of y, then x might overlap with z. In this case, x could be in the North part of z, so there could be some portion of x that's inside the Bounding box of z. This would mean x is in multiple tiles relative to z, such as (N and B).

So, the possible relationships could be N or a combination including N (like N:B, N:NE, N:NW, etc.).

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the definitions and try again.

If x N y, then supy(y) <= infy(x), meaning x is strictly above y.
If y B z, then y is inside z's Bounding box, meaning infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z).

If y is inside z and x is North of y, then x is North of a region that is contained within z. This means:

1. x N z: If supy(z) <= infy(x). This is definitely a possibility since we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). If supy(z) = supy(y), then x N z.

2. x B z: This means x is inside the Bounding box of z, which requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). 
   - We already know infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so the x-constraints are satisfied.
   - But for the y-constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y), which means x is strictly above y. For x to be inside z's Bounding box, we would need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). 
     - We don't know if infy(z) <= infy(x). If infy(z) > infy(x), then this constraint is violated.
     - Similarly, we don't know if supy(x) <= supy(z). If supy(x) > supy(z), then this constraint is violated.

3. Other combinations: If x is not strictly North of z and is not entirely within z's Bounding box, it could be in other tiles like NE, NW, or a combination of multiple tiles.

Let's work through a few examples to get a better understanding:

Scenario 1: z is exactly the same as y.
- If z is exactly the same as y, then x N y implies x N z.

Scenario 2: z extends beyond y in all directions.
- If z extends beyond y in all directions, then x could be in the Bounding box of z, so x B z is possible. But this depends on how far z extends. If z extends far enough north to completely contain x, then x B z. Otherwise, x might be partially inside z and partially North of z, leading to a combination like B:N.

Scenario 3: z extends beyond y in the North direction but not in the East or West.
- In this case, x could be partly or entirely within the Bounding box of z, so x B z or a combination is possible.

Hmm, I'm still not sure. Let's break this down more methodically.

Given the constraints:
- x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

The derived constraints for the relationship between x and z are:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z)

That is, x is contained within the x-projection of z.

For the y-dimension:
- from x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- from y B z: infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

We know infy(z) <= infy(y), but that doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).
Similarly, we know supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x), but that doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

Let's consider the different scenarios:

For x to be North of z (x N z), we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
For x to be in the Bounding box of z (x B z), we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
For x to be North-East of z (x NE z), we need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
For x to be North-West of z (x NW z), we need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z).

Now, given the constraints, which of these are possible?

We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), so x is contained within the x-projection of z. This means x NE z and x NW z are not possible because those relations require x to be outside the x-projection of z.

For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z). If supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) <= infy(x), and x N z is possible. If supy(z) > supy(y), then we can't determine from the given constraints whether supy(z) <= infy(x).

For x B z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z), but we can't determine the relationship between infy(y) and infy(x) from the given constraints. Similarly, we can't determine the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

So, based on the constraints, both x N z and x B z are possible, but I can't rule out other combinations.

Let's think about the problem using a geographical analogy:

If y is within the boundaries of z, and x is North of y, then x could be:
- Completely outside of z, to the North of z.
- Partially overlapping with z, extending to the North.
- Completely inside of z, in the Northern part of z.

I realize that if x N y and y B z, then here are the possibilities:
- If z doesn't extend north beyond y, then x will be strictly North of z: x N z.
- If z extends north beyond y but doesn't fully contain x, then x could be a composition of N (North) and other northern directions (NE, NW, etc.) relative to z.
- If z extends far north such that it completely contains x, then x will be within the Bounding box of z: x B z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relationships between x and z could be:
- x N z
- x B z
- x could be a composition of N, NE, NW, B relative to z.

Actually, I'm still not handling the possible combinations correctly. Let's use the basic definitions of the cardinal directions again.

If x N y, then x is entirely in the North tile of y. The North tile is defined as the region where the y-coordinate is strictly greater than the maximum y-coordinate of the reference region, and the x-coordinate is within the range of x-coordinates of the reference region.

If y B z, then y is entirely within the Bounding box of z. The Bounding box is defined as the region where the coordinates are within the range of coordinates of the reference region.

Now, let's consider where x can be relative to z:

1. x N z: x is entirely in the North tile of z, which is true if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We already know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), so the x-constraints for N are satisfied.
   - For the y-constraint, we need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z).
   - If supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) <= infy(x) and x N z holds.
   - If supy(z) > supy(y), we can't determine from the constraints alone whether supy(z) <= infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) > infy(x), in which case x would not be strictly North of z.

2. x B z: x is entirely within the Bounding box of z, which is true if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We already know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), so the x-constraints for B are satisfied.
   - For the y-constraints, we need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We don't have direct constraints on these in the given information, so we can't determine from the constraints alone whether x B z holds, but it's possible that a point (a, b) with a in [infx(x), supx(x)] and b in [infy(x), supy(x)] is also in z, making B one of the possible relations.

3. x NE z: x is entirely in the North-East tile of z, which is true if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x). Therefore, x NE z is not possible.

4. x NW z: x is entirely in the North-West tile of z, which is true if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, x NW z is not possible.

5. x E z: x is entirely in the East tile of z, which is true if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x). Therefore, x E z is not possible.

6. x W z: x is entirely in the West tile of z, which is true if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, x W z is not possible.

7. x S z: x is entirely in the South tile of z, which is true if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), so the x-constraints for S are satisfied.
   - For the y-constraint, we need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y), which means x is above y.
   - We also know infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z).
   - Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), which doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   - However, given that x is North of y and y is in the Bounding box of z, it's unlikely (but not impossible given just the formal constraints) that x is South of z. For x to be South of z, z would need to be positioned significantly to the North of y, which seems contradictory to y being within z's Bounding box.

8. x SE z: x is entirely in the South-East tile of z, which is true if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x). Therefore, x SE z is not possible.

9. x SW z: x is entirely in the South-West tile of z, which is true if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, x SW z is not possible.

Now, what about the situation where x might be in multiple tiles relative to z? A region can be in multiple tiles if it spans across tile boundaries.

For instance, x could be in both the North and Bounding box regions of z if:
- A part of x is above z (North).
- A part of x is inside the Bounding box of z.

For this to be the case, we'd need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the x-projection of z).
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) > supy(z) (a part of x is inside z's Bounding box, but x extends beyond the North of z).

This is possible given the constraints.

Actually, let's take a step back. I need to be clear about what the question is asking. The question is asking for the possible relations between x and z given x N y and y B z.

I think I've analyzed the possible relationships, but I'm not providing a clear final answer. Based on the constraints and the analysis, the possible cardinal direction relationships between x and z are:

1. x N z: This is possible if supy(z) <= infy(x), which could be true depending on the exact positions of the regions.
2. x B z: This is possible if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which could be true depending on the exact positions of the regions.
3. x N:B z: This is possible if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) > supy(z), indicating that a part of x is inside z's Bounding box, but x extends beyond the North of z.

Other single-tile relationships (NE, NW, E, W, S, SE, SW) or combinations involving these are not possible given the constraints.

Let me double-check the third case, which is a combination of N and B.

For x to have a relation N:B with z:
- A part of x must be in the North tile of z, which is the region where the y-coordinate is strictly greater than supy(z) and the x-coordinate is within the range of z.
- A part of x must be in the Bounding box of z, which is the region where the coordinates are within the range of z.

For this combination (and I'm starting to think I'm overcomplicating this):

x is N of y means x is strictly north of y. That means there is no overlap in their y projections.
y is B of z means that y is contained inside the Bounding box of z. In other words, y is a subset of z.

So, if x is strictly north of y and y is a subset of z, where can x be relative to z?

Hmm, let me think about this geometrically. z can extend in any direction beyond y, and x is strictly north of y. If z doesn't extend north beyond y, then x is strictly north of z. If z extends north beyond y, then there could be some overlap in the y projections of x and z. Depending on how far z extends north, the relationship between x and z can be different.

1. If z doesn't extend north beyond y, then x is strictly north of z: x N z.
2. If z extends north beyond y but doesn't reach x, then x is strictly north of z: x N z.
3. If z extends north beyond y and reaches x but doesn't entirely cover x, then part of x is inside the Bounding box of z, and part is north of z: x N:B z.
4. If z extends far north such that it entirely covers x, then x is inside the Bounding box of z: x B z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- x N z
- x B z
- x N:B z

Wait, I think I might still be overcomplicating this. Let's re-analyze (again) based on the definitions of N and B:

x N y means supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).
y B z means infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Given these, I can derive the following bounds on the coordinates of x relative to z:

From x N y and y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x).
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), so I can't determine a direct bound between infy(x) and supy(z).

For x to be North of z, I need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The last two constraints are already satisfied, but I can't determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) from the given constraints. However, it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x), so N is a possible relation.

For x to be in the Bounding box of z, I need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The first two constraints are already satisfied, but I can't determine if infy(z) <= infy(x) or if supy(x) <= supy(z) from the given constraints. However, it's possible that both conditions are satisfied, so B is a possible relation.

Now, could x span across multiple tiles relative to z? Yes, if x is partially North of z and partially in the Bounding box of z. But can I determine the exact set of relations from the given constraints?

Alright, let's summarize what I've determined:

The possible cardinal direction relationships between x and z, given that x N y and y B z, are:
1. x N z (if supy(z) <= infy(x))
2. x B z (if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))
3. A combination involving N and B (like N:B) if x spans across these tiles relative to z.

But now I'm doubtful whether x N:B z is even possible.

I think the issue is that N and B have specific constraints on the x-projections too:
- For N: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- For B: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Given that the x-constraints are the same for both N and B, any region that's partially N and partially B would need to have points with y-coordinates above supy(z) and points with y-coordinates below supy(z) but above infy(z).

If a region spans across these y-coordinates but has the same x-constraints, it can indeed be in a relation like N:B with z.

So, the possible relations are:
1. x N z (if supy(z) <= infy(x))
2. x B z (if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))
3. x N:B z (if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) > supy(z))

Yeah, I think (but am not 100% sure) that x N:B z means that x spans across two tiles relative to z, which means x overlaps with both the N and B tiles of z.

Let me try to draw it out to make it clearer to myself:
```
      |                 |
  BBB |        N        | BBB
      |                 |
------+-----------------+------
      |                 |
  BBB |      B (z)      | BBB
      |                 |
      |      y is       | 
      |   inside z      |
------+-----------------+------
      |                 |
  BBB |        S        | BBB
      |                 |
```

In this diagram, z is centered, and its 9 tiles are around it (B is the bounding box of z, so it's z itself). y is somewhere inside z (since y B z). x is North of y (x N y), so x is strictly above y.

Now, depending on the exact locations, x could be:

1. Entirely in the N tile of z (if x is far north enough).
2. Entirely within the B tile of z (if z extends far north enough to contain x).
3. Spanning both the N and B tiles (if x partially overlaps with z in the y-dimension).

So, the possible relationships are N, B, and N:B.

Is N:B a valid cardinal direction relation? According to the definition in the problem, a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where R1, ..., Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. The fourth condition of the definition states that there are regions a1, ..., ak, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

Given that, N:B is a valid cardinal direction relation if there are regions a1 and a2 such that a1 belongs to N(z) (the North tile of z), a2 belongs to B(z) (the Bounding box of z), and a1 union a2 belongs to REG.

Wait, hold on. I've been implicitly assuming x can be in multiple tiles. But in the problem statement, a region is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which means it's a connected region without holes. So, if a region is partially in the North tile and partially in the Bounding box, is it valid to say the region has the relation N:B with the reference region?

I think that's what the fourth condition in the definition of cardinal direction relation is for. It basically says the union of regions, each in a different relation with the reference region, should be a valid region in REG.

So, yes, if x's shape is such that part of it is in the N tile of z and part of it is in the B tile of z, and the union of these parts forms a region in REG, then the relation between x and z could be N:B.

Let's try another approach. I know the following:
- y B z (y is in the Bounding box of z).
- x N y (x is North of y).

Consider the following two cases:

Case 1: supy(z) <= infy(x).
If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is entirely in the N tile of z. The fact that y is in the Bounding box of z and x is in the North of y doesn't change that. In this case, the relation is x N z.

Case The case I'm considering is so the relation is x B z.

Wait, that's not right. Let's go back to thinking about it. I have the following:
- y B z (y is in the Bounding box of z).
- x N y (x is North of y).

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

I'll try to carefully think about the case where the relation between x and z could be N:B. If x is partially in the North tile of z and partially in the Bounding box of z, how would that region look?

Let's specifically focus on the y-coordinates. For z, I have the range [infy(z), supy(z)]. For y, given y B z, I have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). For x, given x N y, I have supy(y) <= infy(x).

Intuitively, x being North of y means that the lowest point of x is strictly above the highest point of y. Given y is in the Bounding box of z, the highest point of y is at most the highest point of z. However, this doesn't provide a direct relationship between the lowest point of x and the highest point of z. It's possible that infy(x) > supy(z), in which case x is strictly North of z. But it's also possible that infy(x) <= supy(z), in which case part of x is within the y-projection of z, and part of x might be above z.

[Actually this is becoming way more complex than it should be. Let me take a deep breath and reason through it. I think this is essentially a logical puzzle using the transivity of cardinal directions. I've been overcomplicating it and second-guessing myself.]

In the problem statemet, a cardinal direction relation is defined as R1:...:Rk, where R1, ..., Rk are in {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. There need to be regions a1, ..., ak such that a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and the union of a1, ...a k is a region in REG.

Suppose we have regions x, y, and z with x N y and y B z. x is North of y if a cross-shaped 3x3 grid is centered at y, then x is entirely in the top tile. Similarly, y is in the Bounding box of z if, when a cross-shaped 3x3 grid is centered at z, then y is entirely in the center tile.

Now, the question is: where can x be relative to z?

Given the constraints, if I center a cross-shaped 3x3 grid at z, what tiles can x be in?

1. If z is such that the top of z is below the bottom of x, then x is entirely in the North tile of z, so the relation is x N z.
2. If z extends higher such that there's overlap between the y-projections of x and z, but x doesn't overlap with z, then x could be in multiple northern-related tiles like N, NE, or NW, or a combination of these (I already showed by the x constraints that NE and NW by themselves are impossible).
3. If z extends high enough to completely cover x in both x and y dimensions, then x is entirely within the Bounding box of z, so the relation is x B z.
4. If z overlaps with x partially, then the relation could be a combination like B:N, B:NE, or other viable combinations.

The possible relations could be N, B, or a combination of these with other directions (like N:NE, B:N, etc.).

Actually, I've shown earlier that the only possible single-tile relations are N and B. Other single-tile relations like NE, NW, E, W, S, SE, SW are ruled out by the constraints.

For combinations, given that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), the only possible tile combinations that x could span across (given the constraints on the x-projections) are:
- N and B
- S and B
- N and NE and B
- N and NW and B
- S and SE and B
- S and SW and B
- ... and other combinations that involve N or S, and maybe other northern or southern directions, along with B.

But... I know that x is North of y and y is in the Bounding box of z. If y is in the Bounding box of z, then y doesn't go beyond the boundaries of z. Given that x is North of y, it means x is strictly above y. If z is such that it doesn't extend beyond y in the North direction, then x is strictly North of z too. If z extends beyond y in the North direction, then there could be overlap between x and z in the y-dimension, leading to various possible relations.

Alright, here are the possible relations between x and z, given x N y and y B z:
- x N z (if z doesn't extend beyond y in the North direction).
- x B z (if z extends far enough North to completely contain x).
- x spans across multiple tiles, such as N:B, N:NE:B, N:NW:B, or other valid combinations involving the North direction and the Bounding box (and potentially other tiles, but the constraints rule out certain combinations).

But I'm leaning towards the following as the comprehensive list of possibilities:
- x N z
- x B z
- x N:B z

Let's think step-by-step:

1. Since x N y, the core of x is North of the core of y.
2. Since y B z, the core of y is inside the core of z.
3. Given the above, the core of x is North of a point inside the core of z.

This means x could be:
- Entirely North of z (if the core of z doesn't extend too far North beyond the core of y).
- Entirely inside z (if the core of z extends far enough North to contain the core of x).
- Partially North of z and partially inside z (if the core of z extends North beyond the core of y but not enough to fully contain the core of x).

Given the constraints on the x-projections, those are the possible relations:
- x N z
- x B z
- x N:B z

Actually, let's check if there are any other possibilities by considering the y-projections, actually let me visualize this. Imagine looking at the world from the front, so only y-coordinates are visible, with higher values as you look upward.

Given:
- x N y means supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y B z means infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

So I have:
infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z).
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y).

This implies:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)

From this, I can say:
infy(z) <= infy(x)

But I can't determine the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) from the given constraints. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is strictly North of z. If infy(x) < supy(z), then there's some overlap between the y-projections of x and z.

Similarly, I can't determine the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z). If supy(x) <= supy(z), x's y-projection (and by extension, x itself) is inside z's y-projection. If supy(x) > supy(z), then part of x's y-projection is outside z's y-projection.

Hmm, there's also the case where the constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) is not satisfied, meaning the bottom of z is not below the bottom of x. In this case, the relation would involve the South tile of z. But given the constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z) and infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (from the intrisic property of regions and x N y), we know infy(z) <= infy(x).

Now, looking at the x-projections, given:
infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z).
infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y).

This simplifies to:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means:
infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

In other words, the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. This rules out single-tile relations like NE, E, SE, SW, W, and NW, as these require the x-projections to be disjoint.

Analyzing all the potential relations:
- x N z: Possible if supy(z) <= infy(x)
- x NE z, x E z, x SE z: Not possible due to the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z)
- x S z: Theoretically possible if supy(x) <= infy(z), but this contradicts the derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x), so not possible
- x SW z, x W z, x NW z: Not possible due to the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x)
- x B z: Possible if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For combined relations:
- x N:B z: Possible if infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z)
- x S:B z: Not possible due to the contradiction between the constraints for S and B

Actually let me re-think this. The problem says that we're given regions that are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. So I know that every region is connected, has no holes, and is bounded.

Now, given:
- x N y (x is North of y)
- y B z (y is in the Bounding box of z)

The question is to find the possible relations between x and z.

Given the constraints (translated to our domain):
- If x N y, then the entirety of x is strictly North of y.
- If y B z, then y is entirely within the Bounding box of z, meaning z contains y within its extents.

With these, I now again think that the possible relations between x and z are:
- x N z (if z doesn't extend beyond y in the North direction)
- x B z (if z extends far enough North to completely contain x)
- x N:B z (if z extends North beyond y but not enough to fully contain x)

But, wait, the problem states that "a cardinal direction relation R1:...:Rk" has a clear definition, and the fourth condition is particularly important: there are regions a1, ..., ak, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

I'm wondering if N:B is even a valid relation according to the problem's definition. After all, the relation requires the region to be partitioned, and each part must belong to its respective tile. In the case of N:B, it would mean that there are regions a1 and a2 such that a1 belongs to N(z) and a2 belongs to B(z), and a1 union a2 belongs to REG. But both a1 and a2 need to be given to us, rather than us constructing them.

But N and B could individually be possible. So, the possible relations could be N and B, but not N:B, unless the problem's definition allows for multi-tile relations without explicit partitioning.

Actually, I read the condition 4 again:

"there are regions a1, ..., ak, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

This is a condition on the validity of a cardinal direction relation, not a restriction on the possible relations between regions. It's saying that for a cardinal direction relation R1:...:Rk to be valid, there must exist regions a1, ..., ak that satisfy the conditions stated.

So, N:B is a valid cardinal direction relation if we can find regions a1 and a2 such that a1 belongs to N(z) (the North tile of z), a2 belongs to B(z) (the Bounding box of z), and a1 union a2 belongs to REG.

Given the constraints:
- x N y (x is North of y)
- y B z (y is in the Bounding box of z)

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- x N z (if z doesn't extend beyond y in the North direction)
- x B z (if z extends far enough North to completely contain x)
- x N:B z (if z extends North beyond y but not enough to fully contain x)

Ok, so on further reflection, let me just answer the original question. Given that region x is N of region y, and region y is B of region z, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. N (if z doesn't extend beyond y in the North direction)
2. B (if z extends far enough North to completely contain x)
3. N:B (if z extends North beyond y but not enough to fully contain x)

Hmm, I'm second guessing myself, are there any other valid combinations? Let's check the original constraints one more time:

Given:
- x N y means the entirety of x is strictly North of y.
- y B z means y is entirely within the Bounding box of z, meaning z contains y within its extents.

Let's determine the possible relations between x and z by analyzing the constraints systematically.

From the constraints, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is North of y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's y-projection)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left of the right boundary of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (the bottom of y is above the bottom of z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (the top of y is below the top of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of y is below the bottom of x)

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-projection is within z's x-projection)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of y is above the bottom of z, and the top of y is below the bottom of x)

Now, to determine the possible relations, we need to consider the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z), and between supy(x) and supy(z).

For x to be North of z (x N z), we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

The second constraint is already satisfied. For the first one, we know supy(y) <= infy(x), but we don't know the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) directly. If supy(z) = supy(y), then x is North of z. If supy(z) > supy(y), it depends on the exact relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

For x to be in the Bounding box of z (x B z), we need:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

The second constraint is already satisfied. For the first part, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x). The relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) is unknown, so it depends on their exact relationship.

For x to be in a relation N:B with z, we need:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (part of x is in the Bounding box of z)
- infy(x) <= supy(z) (part of x overlaps with z in the y-dimension)
- supy(x) > supy(z) (part of x extends beyond the top of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

The last constraint is already satisfied. The first one is derived as infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). The second and third constraints depend on the exact relationships, which aren't directly given.

Given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. x N z (if supy(z) <= infy(x))
2. x B z (if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))
3. x N:B z (if infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z))

Now, are there any other possible relations? For a relation like N:NE:B or N:NW:B to be valid, x would need to have points that are in the NE or NW tile of z. Given the constraint that x's x-projection is within z's x-projection, this doesn't seem possible. Similarly, for a relation like B:S or B:SW or B:SE, x would need to have points in the S, SW, or SE tile of z. But given that infy(z) <= infy(x), x can't have points in the S, SW, or SE tile of z.

So, the possible relations are just:
1. x N z
2. x B z
3. x N:B z

S0, in summary, the possible relations between x and z, given x N y and y B z, are:
1. N
2. B
3. N:B

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y: This means x is entirely north of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- y is B of z: This means y is entirely within the bounding box of z

From analyzing these constraints:

1. Since y is inside z's bounding box, and x is north of y, region x must be within the x-projection of z:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

2. For the y-coordinates, we know:
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y B z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x N y)
   
This gives us three possible relations:

1. N: If z doesn't extend north beyond y (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), x will be entirely north of z.

2. B: If z extends far enough north to completely contain x (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), x will be inside z's bounding box.

3. N:B: If z extends partially into x's area (infy(z) ≤ infy(x), infy(x) ≤ supy(z), but supy(x) > supy(z)), x will be partly inside z and partly north of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, B, and N:B.
