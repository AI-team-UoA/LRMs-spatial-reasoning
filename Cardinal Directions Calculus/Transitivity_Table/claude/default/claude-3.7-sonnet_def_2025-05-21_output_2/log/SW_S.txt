PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step-by-step. We have two given relations:
1. Region x is SW of region y
2. Region y is S of region z

We want to find all possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

For SW relation (x SW y):
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For S relation (y S z):
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

Now, let's determine what these relations tell us about the relationship between x and z.

Given that x SW y, we know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is west of y)
2. supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is south of y)

Given that y S z, we know:
3. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is south of z)
4. infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends to the left at least as far as y)
5. supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends to the right at least as far as y)

From 2 and 3, we can deduce:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z)

This means x is definitely south of z. So x must be in one of the southern tiles relative to z: SW, S, or SE.

From 1 and 4, we know:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)

But we can't directly deduce the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) from these. 

Let me consider different scenarios:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is west of z, placing x in the SW tile relative to z.
2. If infx(z) < supx(x) and infx(x) < supx(z), there's overlap in the x-projections. 
   - If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x's x-projection is contained within z's, potentially placing x in the S tile.
   - If there's partial overlap, x could be partly in SW and partly in S tiles.
3. If infx(z) < supx(x) and supx(z) <= supx(x), then z is to the west of x, potentially placing x in the SE tile.
4. If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is east of z, placing x in the SE tile.

So based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- x SW z (if x is both south and west of z)
- x S z (if x is south of z and its x-projection is within z's)
- x SE z (if x is south and east of z)
- A combination involving these southern tiles

Let me double-check this reasoning further.

From the given relations:
- x SW y means x is in the southwest of y
- y S z means y is south of z

If we think about the geographical intuition:
- If y is south of z, then z is north of y
- If x is southwest of y, then x is even more southwest relative to z

So it seems most likely that x would be southwest of z (x SW z).

But let's think more systematically using the constraints.

We know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x SW y)
2. infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)

From 1 and 2, we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)

These don't directly relate supx(x) and infx(z), so we can't determine if x is west of z or not just from these constraints.

Similarly for the east direction:
We know supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z), but we don't have a direct constraint relating supx(x) to supx(y) from x SW y.

Let's reconsider. The constraint we're looking for is between supx(x) and infx(z). 

We have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x SW y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)

If infx(z) < supx(x), then there's an overlap in the x-projections, meaning x could be in the S or SE tiles relative to z. But if supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is west of z, placing it in the SW tile.

Given the constraints, both scenarios are possible. So the possible relations between x and z are:
- x SW z
- x S z
- x SE z

Let me triple-check this by thinking about specific examples.

Example 1:
- z is at coordinates (5,5) with a size of 1x1
- y is at (5,2) with a size of 1x1 (this puts y S of z)
- x is at (2,1) with a size of 1x1 (this puts x SW of y)
- In this example, x is SW of z

Example 2:
- z is at coordinates (5,5) with a size of 5x1
- y is at (5,2) with a size of 1x1 (this puts y S of z)
- x is at (4,1) with a size of 1x1 (this puts x SW of y)
- In this example, x might be considered S of z (since its x-projection overlaps with z's)

Example 3:
- z is at coordinates (1,5) with a size of 1x1
- y is at (1,2) with a size of 1x1 (this puts y S of z)
- x is at (0,1) with a size of 1x1 (this puts x SW of y)
- In this example, x is SW of z

Example 4:
- z is at coordinates (1,5) with a size of 1x1
- y is at (1,2) with a size of 1x1 (this puts y S of z)
- x is at (3,1) with a size of 1x1 (this puts x SE of y, not SW, so this example isn't valid)

Let me try one more example focused on the SE possibility:

Example 5:
- z is at coordinates (1,5) with a size of 1x1
- y is at (1,2) with a size of 2x1 (this puts y S of z)
- x is at (3,1) with a size of 1x1 (this puts x SW of y because its rightmost point is <= leftmost point of y)
- In this example, x might be considered SE of z

Let me verify that Example 5 is correct. We need:
- y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 3, infy(z) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - infx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 1, so 1 <= 1 ✓
  - supx(y) = 3, supx(z) = 2, so 3 <= 2 ✗

Actually, this doesn't work in Example 5. For y to be S of z, y's x-projection should be contained within z's, which isn't the case here. Let me try again:

Example 5 (corrected):
- z is at coordinates (0,5) with a size of 5x1 (extends from x=0 to x=5)
- y is at (1,2) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=1 to x=3, putting y S of z)
- x is at (0,1) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=0 to x=1, putting x SW of y)
- In this example, x is S of z (its x-projection is contained within z's)

Actually, this still doesn't work for x SW y. Let's check:
- x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 1, infx(y) = 1, so 1 <= 1 ✓
  - supy(x) = 2, infy(y) = 2, so 2 <= 2 ✓

Actually, this does work, but it's at the boundary. Let's verify:
- x S z? We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - supy(x) = 2, infy(z) = 5, so 2 <= 5 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(x) = 0, so 0 <= 0 ✓
  - supx(x) = 1, supx(z) = 5, so 1 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is S of z

Let me try one more example to see if x can be SE of z:

Example 6:
- z is at coordinates (0,5) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=0 to x=1)
- y is at (0,2) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=0 to x=2, putting y S of z)
- x is at (2,1) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=2 to x=3, putting x SW of y)
- In this example, let's check if x is SE of z

Let's verify:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 3, infy(z) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(y) = 0, so 0 <= 0 ✓
  - supx(y) = 2, supx(z) = 1, so 2 <= 1 ✗
  - So y is not S of z

Let me try again:

Example 6 (corrected):
- z is at coordinates (0,5) with a size of 3x1 (extends from x=0 to x=3)
- y is at (1,2) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=1 to x=2, putting y S of z)
- x is at (0,1) with a size of 0.5x1 (extends from x=0 to x=0.5, putting x SW of y)
- In this example, let's check if x is SW of z

Let's verify each relation:

- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 3, infy(z) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(y) = 1, so 0 <= 1 ✓
  - supx(y) = 2, supx(z) = 3, so 2 <= 3 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 0.5, infx(y) = 1, so 0.5 <= 1 ✓
  - supy(x) = 2, infy(y) = 2, so 2 <= 2 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x SW z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - supx(x) = 0.5, infx(z) = 0, so 0.5 <= 0 ✗
  - So x is not SW of z

I'm making a mistake somewhere. Let me reconsider.

When we say "a SW b", it means a is in the southwestern direction relative to b. This means a is both south and west of b. By the definitions given:
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

This means the maximum x-coordinate of a is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of b, and the maximum y-coordinate of a is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of b.

Let me use the standard cardinal direction definitions to reason through this again.

We have:
1. x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From 1 and 2, we can deduce:
3. supy(x) <= infy(y) [from 1] and supy(y) <= infy(z) [from 2], so supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x is south of z.
4. supx(x) <= infx(y) [from 1] and infx(z) <= infx(y) [from 2].

But from 4, we can't directly deduce the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) could be either:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which would mean x is west of z, giving x SW z)
- infx(z) < supx(x) (which means there's an overlap in the x-projections)

If there's an overlap, we need to consider the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z):
- If infx(x) < supx(z), then there's an overlap in the x-projections, potentially placing x in the S direction relative to z.
- If supx(z) <= infx(x), then z is west of x, potentially placing x in the SE direction relative to z.

Let's categorize the possibilities based on the constraints and relationships between x and z:

1. SW (South West):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - This is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z) (which is not directly implied by the given conditions, but is a possibility).

2. S (South):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - This is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (which, again, is not directly implied, but is a possibility).

3. SE (South East):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - This is also a possibility if infx(x) >= supx(z).

So, based on the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are SW, S, and SE.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

Given:
1. x SW y: x is southwest of y
2. y S z: y is south of z

When thinking about this in a geographical context:
- If y is south of z, then z is north of y
- If x is southwest of y, then x is south and west of y

Now, relative to z, x is:
- Definitely south (from the transitivity of "southness")
- Possibly west (depending on the exact positions, especially the width of z and how far west x is from y)
- Possibly in the same longitude (if x and z align in the east-west direction)
- Possibly east (if z is narrow and far west, and x is just slightly west of y)

So the relations between x and z could be:
- x SW z: x is southwest of z
- x S z: x is directly south of z
- x SE z: x is southeast of z

I believe this aligns with my earlier, more technical analysis.

Actually, let me consolidate using an example with coordinates to make sure I understand correctly.

First, let me set up a general scenario:
- z is at (a, c) with a width of d-a and a height of 1
- y is at (b, e) where e < c (to ensure y is south of z)
- The width of y is such that a ≤ b and b+width ≤ d (to ensure y's x-projection is contained within z's)
- x is at a position that ensures it's southwest of y

Let's make it concrete:
- z is at (0, 10) with a size of 10x1 (extends from x=0 to x=10 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (2, 5) with a size of 6x1 (extends from x=2 to x=8 and y=5 to y=6)
- This ensures y is S of z

Now, for x to be SW of y, it needs to be west and south of y. Let's place it at:
- x is at (0, 2) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=0 to x=1 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(y) = 2, so 0 <= 2 ✓
  - supx(y) = 8, supx(z) = 10, so 8 <= 10 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 1, infx(y) = 2, so 1 <= 2 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x SW z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - supx(x) = 1, infx(z) = 0, so 1 <= 0 ✗
  - So x is not SW of z

I'm confusing myself with how I've set up the coordinates. Let me clarify:

For a region at coordinates (a, b) with a size of cxd, it extends from x=a to x=a+c and from y=b to y=b+d.

With this definition, let's set up the example again:
- z is at (0, 10) with a size of 10x1 (extends from x=0 to x=10 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (2, 5) with a size of 6x1 (extends from x=2 to x=8 and y=5 to y=6)
- x is at (0, 2) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=0 to x=1 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations using the given definitions:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(y) = 2, so 0 <= 2 ✓
  - supx(y) = 8, supx(z) = 10, so 8 <= 10 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 1, infx(y) = 2, so 1 <= 2 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x S z? We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(z) = 10, so 3 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(x) = 0, so 0 <= 0 ✓
  - supx(x) = 1, supx(z) = 10, so 1 <= 10 ✓
  - So x is S of z ✓

So in this case, x is S of z, not SW. Let me adjust the positions to get x SW z:

- z is at (5, 10) with a size of 5x1 (extends from x=5 to x=10 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (5, 5) with a size of 5x1 (extends from x=5 to x=10 and y=5 to y=6)
- x is at (3, 2) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=3 to x=4 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 5, infx(y) = 5, so 5 <= 5 ✓
  - supx(y) = 10, supx(z) = 10, so 10 <= 10 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 4, infx(y) = 5, so 4 <= 5 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x SW z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - supx(x) = 4, infx(z) = 5, so 4 <= 5 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(z) = 10, so 3 <= 10 ✓
  - So x is SW of z ✓

Great, so here x is SW of z.

Let me set up one more example to check if x can be SE of z:

- z is at (0, 10) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=0 to x=2 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (0, 5) with a size of 5x1 (extends from x=0 to x=5 and y=5 to y=6)
- x is at (4, 2) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=4 to x=6 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(y) = 0, so 0 <= 0 ✓
  - supx(y) = 5, supx(z) = 2, so 5 <= 2 ✗
  - So y is not S of z (it's actually SE of z)

Let me adjust:

- z is at (0, 10) with a size of 10x1 (extends from x=0 to x=10 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (1, 5) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=1 to x=3 and y=5 to y=6)
- x is at (0, 2) with a size of 0.5x1 (extends from x=0 to x=0.5 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(y) = 1, so 0 <= 1 ✓
  - supx(y) = 3, supx(z) = 10, so 3 <= 10 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 0.5, infx(y) = 1, so 0.5 <= 1 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x S z? We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(z) = 10, so 3 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(x) = 0, so 0 <= 0 ✓
  - supx(x) = 0.5, supx(z) = 10, so 0.5 <= 10 ✓
  - So x is S of z ✓

But I want an example where x is SE of z.

Wait, let me reason about this from a different angle. If y is S of z and x is SW of y, then the positions could be visualized as:

```
    z
    
   y
   
x
```

If z is positioned relatively narrow and towards the right, and y is positioned towards the left within the south region of z, x could be to the southwest of y yet still be to the southeast of z. Let me set up this specific example:

- z is at (8, 10) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=8 to x=10 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (3, 5) with a size of 3x1 (extends from x=3 to x=6 and y=5 to y=6)
- x is at (1, 2) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=1 to x=2 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 8, infx(y) = 3, so 8 <= 3 ✗
  - So y is not S of z

I'm confusing myself. Let me re-read the definition of S:
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

This means region a is south of region b if:
1. a's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to b's minimum y-coordinate (a is below b).
2. b's minimum x-coordinate is less than or equal to a's minimum x-coordinate (b's eastern boundary is right of or at a's eastern boundary).
3. a's maximum x-coordinate is less than or equal to b's maximum x-coordinate (a's western boundary is left of or at b's western boundary).

This means a's x-projection is contained within b's x-projection, ensuring a is directly south of b, not southwest or southeast.

Given this, let me try again:

- z is at (1, 10) with a size of 8x1 (extends from x=1 to x=9 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (3, 5) with a size of 4x1 (extends from x=3 to x=7 and y=5 to y=6)
- x is at (1, 2) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=1 to x=2 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 3, so 1 <= 3 ✓
  - supx(y) = 7, supx(z) = 9, so 7 <= 9 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 2, infx(y) = 3, so 2 <= 3 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x SE z? We need supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - supx(z) = 9, infx(x) = 1, so 9 <= 1 ✗
  - So x is not SE of z

Let me try again for SE:

- z is at (0, 10) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=0 to x=1 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (0, 5) with a size of 5x1 (extends from x=0 to x=5 and y=5 to y=6)
- x is at (3, 2) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=3 to x=4 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(y) = 0, so 0 <= 0 ✓
  - supx(y) = 5, supx(z) = 1, so 5 <= 1 ✗
  - So y is not S of z 

But I want y to be S of z and x to be SE of Z. Let me look at the definition of S again.

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

Oh, I've been interpreting the last condition incorrectly. For a to be South of b, a's maximum x-coordinate should be less than or equal to b's maximum x-coordinate, meaning a cannot extend further east than b. Similarly, b's minimum x-coordinate should be less than or equal to a's minimum x-coordinate, meaning a cannot extend further west than b. Basically, the x-projection of a should fit within the x-projection of b.

Given this understanding, I'll try again:

- z is at (3, 10) with a size of 4x1 (extends from x=3 to x=7 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (4, 5) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=4 to x=6 and y=5 to y=6)
- x is at (2, 2) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=2 to x=3 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 3, infx(y) = 4, so 3 <= 4 ✓
  - supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 7, so 6 <= 7 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 3, infx(y) = 4, so 3 <= 4 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x SW z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - supx(x) = 3, infx(z) = 3, so 3 <= 3 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(z) = 10, so 3 <= 10 ✓
  - So x is SW of z ✓

Actually, let me try a different approach to see if x can be SE of z:

- z is at (0, 10) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=0 to x=2 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (1, 5) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=1 to x=3 and y=5 to y=6)
- x is at (3, 2) with a size of 1x1 (extends from x=3 to x=4 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(y) = 1, so 0 <= 1 ✓
  - supx(y) = 3, supx(z) = 2, so 3 <= 2 ✗
  - So y is not S of z 

I'm still struggling to find a proper example. Let me go back to the basics.

For y to be S of z, y should be directly south of z, with its x-projection contained within z's x-projection.
For x to be SW of y, x should be to the west and south of y.

For x to be SE of z (which is what I'm trying to determine is a possibility), x would need to be to the east and south of z.

The constraints I'm having give me:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z) (x is south of both y and z)
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is west of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's western boundary is west of or at y's western boundary)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's eastern boundary is east of or at z's eastern boundary)

From these, I can't directly derive supx(z) <= infx(x) (which would make x east of z).

I'm thinking the issue is the constraints in the problem statement don't allow for the scenario I'm trying to construct. If x is SW of y and y is S of z, it seems unlikely that x can be SE of z.

Let me try one more example:

- z is at (2, 10) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=2 to x=4 and y=10 to y=11)
- y is at (2, 5) with a size of 2x1 (extends from x=2 to x=4 and y=5 to y=6)
- x is at (1, 2) with a size of 0.5x1 (extends from x=1 to x=1.5 and y=2 to y=3)

Let's check the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 2, so 2 <= 2 ✓
  - supx(y) = 4, supx(z) = 4, so 4 <= 4 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 1.5, infx(y) = 2, so 1.5 <= 2 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x S z? We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(z) = 10, so 3 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 1, so 2 <= 1 ✗
  - So x is not S of z 

- x SW z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - supx(x) = 1.5, infx(z) = 2, so 1.5 <= 2 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(z) = 10, so 3 <= 10 ✓
  - So x is SW of z ✓

- x SE z? We need supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - supx(z) = 4, infx(x) = 1, so 4 <= 1 ✗
  - So x is not SE of z

Let me double-check the definition of SE for my clarity:
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

This means a's minimum x-coordinate is greater than or equal to b's maximum x-coordinate (a is to the east of b) and a's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to b's minimum y-coordinate (a is to the south of b).

Given all this, it becomes clearer: If x is to the southwest of y, and y is to the south of z, then x cannot be to the southeast of z.

Some further thought confirms this:
From x SW y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
From y S z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z).
However, to have x SE z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x).

Combining these would give:
supx(z) <= infx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This would require supx(z) <= supx(z), which is true, but also supx(y) <= supx(z) and infx(y) <= supx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) <= infx(y). The constraints supx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) <= infx(y) together would give supx(z) <= infx(y), which contradicts the constraint infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). 

So, SE is not a possible relation between x and z.

Let me now look into S:
For x to be S of z, we need:
supy(x) <= infy(z)
infx(z) <= infx(x)
supx(x) <= supx(z)

From x SW y, we have:
supx(x) <= infx(y)
supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y S z, we have:
supy(y) <= infy(z)
infx(z) <= infx(y)
supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z) (So, x is south of z)
infx(z) <= infx(y) (Given from y S z)
supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (This means supx(x) <= supx(z))

For the second condition of x S z (infx(z) <= infx(x)), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) from y S z, but we don't have a direct relation between infx(y) and infx(x) from x SW y.

So, x S z is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x), which is not constrained by the given conditions.

Finally, let's check SW:
For x to be SW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z)
supy(x) <= infy(z)

From x SW y and y S z, we've already established supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the first condition, we have:
supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x SW y)
But we don't have a direct relation between infx(y) and infx(z) from the constraints.

So, x SW z is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z), which is not constrained by the given conditions.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x S z (if infx(z) <= infx(x), which isn't constrained by the given conditions)
- x SW z (if supx(x) <= infx(z), which isn't constrained by the given conditions)
- x ??? (I'll check other possibilities)

Ok ok, let me think about this differently. If x is SW of y, that means x is SW of y. Similarly, if y is S of z, that means y is S of z. If we know these two statements, we need to figure out the possible positions of x in relation to z.

Given that x is SW of y, the position of x is constrained to be in the SW region relative to y. And given that y is S of z, the position of y is constrained to be in the S region relative to z.

So, x is in the SW region relative to a y, and that y is in the S region relative to z.

I need to figure out the possible positions of x relative to z.

From the definition of S, y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection. This means y can't extend further east or west than z.
From the definition of SW, x is to the west of y.

If x is to the west of y, and y's westernmost boundary is not further west than z's, then x could be:
1. SW of z (if x is far enough west, beyond z's western boundary)
2. S of z (if x's x-projection still falls within z's x-projection)

Let me construct specific examples for each:

For x SW z:
- z spans from (2, 10) to (6, 11)
- y spans from (3, 5) to (5, 6)  (y S z)
- x spans from (1, 2) to (2, 3)  (x SW y, and x SW z)

For x S z:
- z spans from (1, 10) to (6, 11)
- y spans from (3, 5) to (5, 6)  (y S z)
- x spans from (2, 2) to (3, 3)  (x SW y, but x S z because x's x-projection is within z's)

At first glance, those seem to be the only two possibilities. But let's double-check if there are any other configurations.

Could x be SE of z?
For x to be SE of z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x). But from x SW y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y). So, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y). 

But we also know from y S z that infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). These constraints would lead to supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(z), which means infx(y) = supx(z). 

This is a very restrictive case where y's western boundary exactly aligns with z's eastern boundary. In this case, x would need to be exactly at the same x-coordinate as both, which seems like a borderline case. I'm not sure if this qualifies as a genuine "SE" relation, since x and z would have to be aligned on the east-west axis.

Let me double-check the definition of SE: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b). 

Based on this strict definition, it seems the case where infx(y) = supx(z) would still allow for x to be SE of z, as long as x's minimum x-coordinate is exactly equal to z's maximum x-coordinate.

For x SE z:
- z spans from (1, 10) to (3, 11)
- y spans from (3, 5) to (5, 6)  (y S z, with y's western boundary exactly at z's eastern)
- x spans from (3, 2) to (4, 3)  (x SW y, with x's eastern boundary at y's western)

Let's check the relationships for this example:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 3, so 1 <= 3 ✓
  - supx(y) = 5, supx(z) = 3, so 5 <= 3 ✗
  - So y is not S of z 

I think made an error. Let me recheck the definition of S:
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For y S z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).
This means supx(y) can't be greater than supx(z), which rules out the example I just constructed.

Given all this, it seems x can only be SW or S of z, not SE.

Let me do one final example to be sure:

- z spans from (2, 10) to (7, 11)
- y spans from (3, 5) to (6, 6)  (y S z)
- x spans from (1, 2) to (3, 3)  (x SW y)

Let's check the relationships for this example:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 3, so 2 <= 3 ✓
  - supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 7, so 6 <= 7 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 3, infx(y) = 3, so 3 <= 3 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x S z? We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(z) = 10, so 3 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 1, so 2 <= 1 ✗
  - So x is not S of z 

- x SW z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - supx(x) = 3, infx(z) = 2, so 3 <= 2 ✗
  - So x is not SW of z 

Wait, so x is neither S nor SW of z in this example, despite y being S of z and x being SW of y?

Let me recheck:
- x SW z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - supx(x) = 3, infx(z) = 2, so 3 <= 2 ✗
  - This is wrong. x's maximum x-coordinate is 3, and z's minimum x-coordinate is 2. So 3 > 2, which means x is not entirely west of z.

This means x's x-projection overlaps with z's. So, x is not SW of z in this example.

Let's check for a different direction:

- x W z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
  - supx(x) = 3, infx(z) = 2, so 3 <= 2 ✗
  - So x is not W of z 

In this case, x's x-projection overlaps with z's, and x is definitely south of z. 

So what's the relation? One possibility is that x is in a tiled relation with respect to z. It's partly in the S tile and partly in the SW tile. Let's denote this as x (S:SW) z, indicating that region x intersects with both the S and SW tiles with respect to z.

Let me re-evaluate this.

The question asks for the relation between x and z in terms of the standard tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B). If a region doesn't fit entirely in one of these standard tiles, the relation is a combination of the tiles it intersects.

In the example I just gave:
- x spans from (1, 2) to (3, 3)
- z spans from (2, 10) to (7, 11)

Here, x intersects with both the SW and W tiles with respect to z.

For S tile, we need:
supy(x) <= infy(z)  (which is true: 3 <= 10)
infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (here, infx(z) = 2, infx(x) = 1, so the condition is false)

For SW tile, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)  (here, supx(x) = 3, infx(z) = 2, so the condition is false)

For W tile, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z)  (which is false: 3 <= 2 is false)
infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (here, infy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 2, so 10 <= 2 is false)

So, against these strict definitions, x doesn't fit entirely in any of the standard tiles. 

But if we're considering the notion of a region overlapping with multiple tiles, then in this case, x overlaps with both the SW and S tiles. The SW part is the portion of x to the west of z, and the S part is the portion of x beneath z.

Actually, hold on. The problem definition I've been re-reading this whole time includes a definition of when a region can be in a multi-tile relation. It says a cardinal direction relation can be of the form R1: ... : Rk, where R1, ..., Rk belongs to the set of basic cardinal directions. This would correspond to a region that overlaps with multiple tiles.

For example, in the example I just gave, the relation might be x (SW:S) z. But then, if I look at the formal definition of the tiled relations, it says:

a = R1:...:Rk (b) if and only if there exist a1, ..., ak belongs to REG such that a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak = a.

This means the region a can be decomposed into subregions a1, ..., ak, each of which belongs to one of the basic tiles with respect to b. But these should add up exactly to a. And each subregion should be a valid region (in REG).

In the aforementioned example, the issue is not that x is neither S nor SW of z. Instead, x partially overlaps with both the S and SW tiles of z. Therefore, if we decompose x into two regions, one would be entirely in S region with respect to z (though it would not be a rectangular region in our context) and the other would be entirely in SW region. In this case, the relation would be x (S:SW) z.

However, I've been thinking about the more general case. If x is SW of y and y is S of z, then x could be S of z, SW of z, or a combination like (S:SW) of z, depending on the specific positions of the regions.

To wrap up, the possible relations between x and z, based on the given constraints, are:
1. x S z (if x's x-projection is entirely within z's)
2. x SW z (if x is entirely west of z)
3. x (S:SW) z (if x partially overlaps with both the S and SW tiles of z)

This means the possible answers could be S, SW, or a combination of S and SW.

Hold on, there's another possibility I overlooked. Let's consider this configuration:

- z spans from (2, 10) to (7, 11)
- y spans from (3, 5) to (6, 6)  (y S z)
- x spans from (1, 2) to (2, 3)  (x SW y)

In this case, x's eastern boundary coincides with z's western boundary. 

Let's verify the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 2, infx(y) = 3, so 2 <= 3 ✓
  - supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 7, so 6 <= 7 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 2, infx(y) = 3, so 2 <= 3 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x SW z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - supx(x) = 2, infx(z) = 2, so 2 <= 2 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(z) = 10, so 3 <= 10 ✓
  - So x is SW of z ✓

So in this borderline case, x would still be SW of z.

And to make a similar borderline case for S:

- z spans from (1, 10) to (7, 11)
- y spans from (3, 5) to (6, 6)  (y S z)
- x spans from (2, 2) to (3, 3)  (x SW y)

Let's verify the relations:
- y S z? We need supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
  - supy(y) = 6, infy(z) = 10, so 6 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 3, so 1 <= 3 ✓
  - supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 7, so 6 <= 7 ✓
  - So y is S of z ✓

- x SW y? We need supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y)
  - supx(x) = 3, infx(y) = 3, so 3 <= 3 ✓
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 5, so 3 <= 5 ✓
  - So x is SW of y ✓

- x S z? We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - supy(x) = 3, infy(z) = 10, so 3 <= 10 ✓
  - infx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 2, so 1 <= 2 ✓
  - supx(x) = 3, supx(z) = 7, so 3 <= 7 ✓
  - So x is S of z ✓

In this borderline case, x is S of z.

So, in conclusion, based on the given constraints "region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z", the possible relations between region x and region z are:
1. x S z
2. x SW z
3. x (S:SW) z (which I believe refers to a combined relation where x overlaps both S and SW tiles)

The possible answers are S, SW, or S:SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I'll determine the possible relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- x is SW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these, I can determine:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) - this means x is definitely south of z

For the east-west relationship:
- From x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y S z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Two possible scenarios exist:
1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is west of z, making x SW of z
2. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection, making x S of z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
S, SW
