PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I'm being asked to find the possible relations between region x and region z, given that:
1. Region x is NE of region y
2. Region y is S of region z

Let's work through this step-by-step using the definitions provided.

First, let's understand what these given relations mean:

1. x is NE of y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
   - This means x is strictly to the northeast of y. 
   - x is both strictly to the east and strictly to the north of y.

2. y is S of z means: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - This means y is strictly to the south of z.
   - y is below z, but horizontally it's within the east-west extent of z.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z.

Since x is NE of y, we know:
- x is strictly to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x))
- x is strictly to the north of y (supy(y) <= infy(x))

Since y is S of z, we know:
- y is strictly to the south of z (supy(y) <= infy(z))
- y is horizontally within the east-west extent of z (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

Let's combine these to reason about the relationship between x and z:

First, regarding the north-south relationship between x and z:
- We know x is strictly north of y (supy(y) <= infy(x))
- And y is strictly south of z (supy(y) <= infy(z))
- However, this doesn't directly tell us the north-south relationship between x and z. 

x could be:
- North of z (if infy(x) > supy(z))
- Overlapping with z in the north-south dimension (if infy(x) <= supy(z))

Regarding the east-west relationship:
- We know x is strictly east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x))
- And y is horizontally within z (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

Let's analyze: if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), then we can't directly determine if x is strictly east of z or overlapping with z in the east-west dimension.

Let me reason through this with a concrete example to understand the constraints better.

Consider the following example with 2D coordinates:
- Let z be a region with bounding box [0,4] × [6,10]
- Let y be a region with bounding box [1,3] × [3,5] (which is S of z)
- Let x be a region with bounding box [5,7] × [8,10] (which is NE of y)

In this case, x is NE of z. But let's try another example:
- Let z be a region with bounding box [0,8] × [6,10]
- Let y be a region with bounding box [1,3] × [3,5] (which is S of z)
- Let x be a region with bounding box [5,7] × [8,10] (which is NE of y)

In this second example, x is N of z (not NE), because x is within the east-west extent of z.

Let me systematically go through the possibilities. 

Given that x is NE of y and y is S of z, we know:
1. x is strictly to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x))
2. x is strictly to the north of y (supy(y) <= infy(x))
3. y is strictly to the south of z (supy(y) <= infy(z))
4. y is horizontally within z (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

From 2 and 3, we can deduce:
5. supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means both x and z are to the north of y, but we can't determine their north-south relationship to each other.

From 1 and 4, we can deduce:
6. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means that x is to the east of y, y is within the east-west extent of z, but we can't directly determine the east-west relationship between x and z.

Let's consider all possible scenarios for the east-west relationship between x and z:
- If infx(x) > supx(z), then x is strictly to the east of z. This is possible based on our constraints.
- If infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z), then x overlaps with z on the east. This is possible.
- If infx(x) >= infx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is horizontally within z. This is possible.

And for the north-south relationship:
- If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is strictly to the north of z. This is possible.
- If infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z), then x overlaps with z on the north. This is possible.
- If infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is vertically within z. This is possible.

Given these possibilities, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- N (if x is strictly north of z and horizontally within z)
- NE (if x is strictly north and strictly east of z)
- E (if x is strictly east of z and vertically within z)
- SE (if x overlaps with z on the east and x extends south of z)
- S (if x is strictly south of z and horizontally within z)
- SW (if x is strictly south and strictly west of z)
- W (if x is strictly west of z and vertically within z)
- NW (if x is strictly north and strictly west of z)
- B (if x is inside the bounding box of z)

But wait, I need to be more careful here. Let's refine this by carefully considering the given constraints.

Given that:
1. x is NE of y (supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x))
2. y is S of z (supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

Let's consider the north-south relationship between x and z:
- From 1 and 2, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
- This means both x and z are to the north of y.
- We don't know the direct north-south relationship between x and z based on these constraints alone.

Hmm wait, I need to be even more careful. Let's look at what we know:

1. x is NE of y:
   - x is strictly east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - x is strictly north of y: supy(y) <= infy(x)

2. y is S of z:
   - y is strictly south of z: supy(y) <= infy(z)
   - y is horizontally within z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now let's deduce information about x and z:
- From 1 and 2, we know x is strictly north of y (supy(y) <= infy(x)) and y is strictly south of z (supy(y) <= infy(z)).
- However, this doesn't tell us the direct north-south relationship between x and z. x could be north of z, at the same level, or even south of z.

- From 1, we know x is strictly east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x)).
- From 2, we know y is horizontally within z (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)).
- Combining these, we get: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
- This means supx(y) is a lower bound for both infx(x) and supx(z), but we can't directly compare infx(x) and supx(z). x could be east of z, or they could overlap in the east-west dimension.

So, we can't determine the exact relationship between x and z based on the given constraints. x could be in various positions relative to z.

Hmm, I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me try to be more rigorous.

Given:
1. x is NE of y: (a) supx(y) <= infx(x) and (b) supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y is S of z: (c) supy(y) <= infy(z), (d) infx(z) <= infx(y) and (e) supx(y) <= supx(z)

From (a), (d), and (e), we get: supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
From (b) and (c), we get: supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Let's check if we can determine the east-west relationship between x and z:
- x is east of z if infx(x) > supx(z)
- x overlaps with z in the east-west dimension if infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(x) > infx(z)
- x is west of z if supx(x) < infx(z)
- x is within z in the east-west dimension if infx(x) >= infx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x)

This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x).

However, we can't determine the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x), or between infx(z) and supx(x). So, x could be east of z, or they could overlap in the east-west dimension.

Similarly, for the north-south relationship, from (b) and (c), we get:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

But we can't determine the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), or between supy(x) and infy(z), or between infy(x) and supy(z). So, x could be north of z, south of z, or they could overlap in the north-south dimension.

Hmm, my previous reasoning is still incomplete. Let's take a step back and think about this geometrically.

If x is NE of y and y is S of z, then y is to the south of both x and z. We know y's horizontal extent is within z's, but x is strictly to the east of y. This means x can be to the east of z, or x and z can overlap in the east-west dimension.

In the north-south dimension, both x and z are to the north of y. But we don't know their north-south relationship to each other.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- NE (if x is both strictly north and strictly east of z)
- E (if x is strictly east of z and within the north-south extent of z)
- SE (if x is strictly east of z and extends south of z)
- N (if x is strictly north of z and within the east-west extent of z)
- B (if x is within the bounding box of z)
- S (if x is strictly south of z and within the east-west extent of z)

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me try a different approach. I'll list out the constraints from the given relations and then check each cardinal direction for compatibility.

From x is NE of y:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is strictly east of y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is strictly north of y)

From y is S of z:
3. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is strictly south of z)
4. infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is within the east-west extent of z)
5. supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the east-west extent of z)

Now, let's check if each cardinal direction for x relative to z is compatible with these constraints.

For N (x is strictly north of z):
- This requires: supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- From 3, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From 2, we know supy(y) <= infy(x). But we can't derive supy(z) <= infy(x).
- From 4, we know infx(z) <= infx(y). From 1, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't give us a direct comparison between infx(z) and infx(x), although we can infer that if infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(y) <= infx(x) would imply infx(z) <= infx(x).
- From 1 and 5, we get supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't tell us if supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, N is a possible relation.

Actually, looking at this differently: If y is S of z, then y is below z but horizontally within z. If x is NE of y, then x is both strictly east and strictly north of y. Given that y is horizontally within z, if x is strictly east of y, then x could be strictly east of z or they could overlap in the east-west dimension. Similarly, if x is strictly north of y and y is strictly south of z, then x could be strictly north of z, at the same level, or even south of z, depending on the exact positions.

Let me try one more approach. I'll try to visualize a concrete example where x is NE of y and y is S of z, and then see the possible positions for x relative to z.

Imagine:
- z is a square with bottom-left corner at (0, 10) and top-right corner at (10, 20).
- y is a square with bottom-left corner at (2, 5) and top-right corner at (8, 9). This is S of z.
- x is a square with bottom-left corner at (12, 12) and top-right corner at (15, 15). This is NE of y.

In this example, x is NE of z.

But I can easily adjust the position of x and still maintain that x is NE of y. For instance, x could be:
- A square with corners at (5, 12) and (8, 15), which would make x N of z.
- A square with corners at (12, 8) and (15, 11), which would make x E of z.
- A square with corners at (5, 8) and (8, 11), which would make x inside the projection of z (vertically and horizontally), but not within z. This would be B of z.
- A square with corners at (5, 5) and (8, 8), which would make x S of z.
- A square with corners at (12, 5) and (15, 8), which would make x SE of z.

It seems that, depending on the exact positions, x can be N, NE, E, SE, S, or B of z, all while maintaining the conditions that x is NE of y and y is S of z.

Let me double check:
- For NE: x is strictly northeast of z. This is possible if x is far enough to the northeast.
- For N: x is strictly north of z and within z's east-west extent. This is possible if x is moved west but still north.
- For E: x is strictly east of z and within z's north-south extent. This is possible if x is moved south but still east.
- For SE: x is strictly southeast of z. This is possible if x is moved further south and still east.
- For S: x is strictly south of z and within z's east-west extent. This is possible if x is moved further south and west.
- For B: x is inside the bounding box of z. This is possible if x is positioned right.

But can x be SW, W, or NW of z? Let's check:

- For SW: x needs to be strictly southwest of z. But since x is NE of y and y is S of z, x is always northeast of a point that's south of z. It doesn't seem possible for x to be SW of z.
- For W: x needs to be strictly west of z. But since x is NE of y, it's always east of y. And since y is S of z, y is within z's east-west extent. So, x can't be strictly west of z.
- For NW: x needs to be strictly northwest of z. For similar reasons as SW, this doesn't seem possible.

From this reasoning, it appears that x can be N, NE, E, SE, S, or B of z. But can x be only N, NE, E, SE, or S of z? Let me see if x can be B of z.

Actually, if I draw this out, I realize I can't get x to be strictly south of z (S relation) while maintaining that x is NE of y and y is S of z. This is because if y is S of z, then y is below z. If x is NE of y, then x is to the northeast of y. This would put x to the northeast of a point that's south of z. If x is strictly south of z, it would be below z, which contradicts it being northeast of a point that's already south of z.

I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me refine my reasoning.

 if y is S of z, it means y is outside of z, below it. And if x is NE of y, it's outside of y, to the northeast. This places x northeast of a point that's already south of z. It's geometrically impossible for x to be strictly south of z in this setup. And I think from a similar reasoning, x can't be SE of z either.

Let me reconsider:

x can be N of z: x is strictly north of z and within z's east-west extent. This is possible.
x can be NE of z: x is strictly northeast of z. This is possible.
x can be E of z: x is strictly east of z and within z's north-south extent. This is possible.
x can still be SE of z: x is strictly to the southeast of z. This is still possible if x is far enough to the east and not too much to the north.

Actually, wait. Let's draw it out:

```
   z
   |
y  |
   |
    \
     x
```

Here, y is S of z, and x is NE of y. It's clear that x can be E of z (directly to the right of z), NE of z (in the northeastern direction from z), or even N of z (if x is more to the north than the east). Can x be SE of z?

Actually, I think this depends on the shape and size of z. If z is large enough, then even though x is northeast of a point y that's south of z, x could still be southeast of z's topmost point. But let's see if this is consistent with the formal definitions.

For SE: x is strictly to the southeast of z. This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From our constraints:
- From y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).
- From x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But from our constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is south of z). This doesn't tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Similarly, for x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within z's east-west extent). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). But it's possible for supx(z) to be greater than infx(x).

Actually I think I've been going around in circles a bit. Let me get more clarity by drawing more examples:

```
      z
      |
   y  |
      |
       \
        x
```

In this setup, y is S of z and x is NE of y. It's clear that x is E of z.

```
    z
    |
 y  |
    |
     \
      x
```

Here, x is more to the northeast of y, but it's still E of z. If we move x more to the north,

```
       x
       |
       |
    z  |
    |  |
 y  |  |
    |  |
     \ |
      \|
```

Now, x is N of z.

Let's try to get x to be NE of z:

```
          x
         /|
        / |
       /  |
    z /   |
    |/    |
 y  |     |
    |     |
     \    |
      \   |
```

Here, x is NE of z. Let's try to get x to be SE of z:

```
    z     
    |\    
 y  | \   
    |  \  
     \  \ 
      \  \
       \  x
```

I think with this, I can get x to be SE of z.

Let's try to get x to be S of z:

```
    z     
    |     
 y  |     
    |     
     \    
      \   
       x  
```

Hmm with this, it's unclear if x is truly to the south of z. Let me draw differently:

```
    z     
    |     
    |     
 y  |     
    |     
     \    
      \   
       x  
```

I think in the example above, x could be S of z. But can x ever be to the west or southwest or southeast of z? Let me think. 

If y is S of z, then y is strictly south of z and horizontally within z. If x is NE of y, then x is strictly to the northeast of y. So, x is strictly to the northeast of a point that's strictly south of and horizontally within z.

For x to be W of z, it would need to be strictly to the west of z. But since x is NE of y, it's to the east of y. And since y is horizontally within z, x couldn't be strictly to the west of z. The same logic applies for SW and NW.

For x to be S of z, it would need to be strictly to the south of z. This seems contradictory because if y is S of z and x is NE of y, then x would be to the north of y. But since y is already south of z, it's not immediately obvious that x can be south of z. Let's  check the formal definitions.

For S: x is strictly south of z and horizontally within z. This means supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From our constraints:
- From y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).
- From x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is south of z). This doesn't tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

I think I've been going around in circles a bit and it's hard to determine from the formal definitions alone. Let me try to reason more geometrically.

If y is S of z, then y is entirely below z. If x is NE of y, then x is to the northeast of y. Depending on the relative positions, x could be:
- Strictly to the east of z (E)
- Strictly to the northeast of z (NE)
- Strictly to the north of z but horizontally within z (N)
- Strictly to the southeast of z (SE)
- Strictly to the south of z but horizontally within z (S)
- Inside the bounding box of z (B)

That's six possibilities. I think I need to eliminate some of them by considering additional constraints.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's simplify.

If y is S of z, then y is strictly south of z. If x is NE of y, then x is strictly northeast of y. The question is: what are the possible positions of x relative to z?

Given that y is strictly south of z, and x is strictly northeast of y, x can be:
- Northeast of z (if x is far enough to the east and north)
- North of z (if x is mainly north of y and not too far east)
- East of z (if x is mainly east of y and not too far north)
- within z's bounding box (if z is large enough)

But given the northeast constraint of x relative to y, I don't think x can be strictly south, southwest, west, or northwest of z. Southeast is also questionable, but it might be possible if z is small in the east-west dimension and x is far to the east.

Actually, let's try a different approach. I'll try to visualize the regions of space for x, given the constraints.

Given that y is S of z, y is strictly south of z. The space for x, given that x is NE of y, is the entire northeast quadrant starting from y.

Now, let's consider the cardinal directions for x relative to z.

For E (east): x is strictly east of z and vertically within z. This is possible if x is only slightly north of y, such that it's still within z's vertical extent.

For NE (northeast): x is strictly northeast of z. This is possible if x is far enough to the northeast of y.

For N (north): x is strictly north of z and horizontally within z. This is possible if x is only slightly east of y, such that it's still within z's horizontal extent.

For SE (southeast): x is strictly southeast of z. For this to be true, x needs to be strictly to the east of z and strictly to the south of z. But given that x is NE of y, which is S of z, it's not obvious that x can be south of z. But let me think more.

If y is S of z, then supy(y) <= infy(z). And if x is NE of y, then supy(y) <= infy(x). This doesn't tell us directly about the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), so we can't determine if x is north or south of z based on the constraints alone.

Actually, let's say x is far enough to the east of y, such that it's beyond z's eastern boundary. If it's only slightly north of y, such that it's still south of z's northern boundary, then x could be SE of z.

For S (south): x is strictly south of z and horizontally within z. For this to be true, x needs to be horizontally within z, which is possible given our constraints. But it also needs to be strictly south of z. This is where the constraint that x is NE of y might cause an issue. But from our formal constraints, if y is S of z, then supy(y) <= infy(z). And if x is NE of y, then supy(y) <= infy(x). This doesn't tell us directly about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, S is also a possible relation.

For B (bounding box): x is inside the bounding box of z. If z is large enough, it's possible for x to be within z's bounding box while still being NE of y.

For SW, W, and NW: Given that x is NE of y and y is horizontally within and strictly south of z, it doesn't seem possible for x to be strictly west of z. So, these relations seem unlikely.

From this reasoning, it appears that the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, B.

Let me double-check if SE and S are truly possible.

For SE: x is strictly southeast of z. This means x is strictly to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)) and strictly to the south of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)).

From our constraints:
- From y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).
- From x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

For x to be strictly east of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). From our constraints, supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but we can't deduce supx(z) <= infx(x). However, if supx(z) is only slightly greater than supx(y), and infx(x) is significantly greater than supx(y), then it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x).

For x to be strictly south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x), but we can't deduce supy(x) <= infy(z). However, if supy(x) is close to supy(y) and infy(z) is significantly greater than supy(y), then it's possible for supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, SE is a possible relation.

Similarly, for S, we can use the same reasoning to show that it's a possible relation. The key here is that while x is north of y, it doesn't mean x is north of everything. If z is high enough north, then x could still be south of z even while being north of y.

Given all this, I think the possible relations are: N, NE, E, SE, S, B. And we've established that SW, W, and NW are not possible relations.

Let me triple check the S (South) relation in particular.

For S: x is strictly south of z and horizontally within z. This means supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From our constraints:
- From y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).
- From x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

For x to be horizontally within z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). From our constraints, infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x). However, we can't deduce supx(x) <= supx(z) from our constraints. But but if supx(x) is close to infx(x), and supx(z) is significantly greater than supx(y), then it's possible for supx(x) <= supx(z).

For x to be strictly south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x), but we can't deduce supy(x) <= infy(z).

Actually, when I say "x is NE of y", it means x is in the northeast quadrant from y, NOT that x is "to the north of y" on the north-south axis. It means specifically that x is strictly to the northeast of y. This means supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is strictly east of y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is strictly north of y). So the "north" in "northeast" does mean "north on the north-south axis". And if y is S of z, which means y is strictly south of z, then y is below z on the north-south axis. If x is strictly north of y (from the NE relation), then x is higher than y on the north-south axis. But this doesn't tell us the direct north-south relationship between x and z. 

Let me be even more explicit. If y is situated at (0, 0), z might be at (0, 10). If y is S of z, then y is strictly south of z. If x is NE of y, x might be at (10, 5). Now, while x is NE of y, it's still south of z. Or x might be at (10, 15), in which case it's north of z. The exact position determines the north-south relationship.

So, yes, S is still a possible relation. And so are N, NE, E, SE, and B.

Actually, I realized I've been repeatedly thinking through the same relations. Let me double-check my earlier results.

Let's approach this differently:

For NE: x is strictly northeast of z. This is certainly possible.

For N: x is strictly north of z and horizontally within z. This is possible if x is not too far east, such that it's still within z's horizontal extent.

For E: x is strictly east of z and vertically within z. This is possible if x is not too far north, such that it's still within z's vertical extent.

For SE: x is strictly southeast of z. This is possible if x is east of z and still south of z. As I've explained, if z is high enough north, x can be north of y but still south of z.

For S: x is strictly south of z and horizontally within z. This is possible if x is within z's horizontal extent and still south of z.

For B: x is inside the bounding box of z. This is possible if z is large enough to contain x.

For SW, W, and NW: These relations would require x to be strictly west of z. But since x is NE of y and y is horizontally within z, it doesn't seem possible for x to be strictly west of z. So, these relations are not possible.

OK, I think my analysis is correct. The possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, B. And the relations SW, W, and NW are not possible.

Hmm, actualy, let me check S more carefully. 

For S: x is strictly south of z and horizontally within z. This means supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From our constraints:
- From y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).
- From x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

For x to be horizontally within z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). From our constraints, infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). While we can deduce infx(z) <= infx(x), we cannot deduce supx(x) <= supx(z). For example, if z is horizontally smaller than x, then x might not be horizontally within z.

OK so maybe S is not a possible relation, but my argument doesn't seem totally clear.

Actually let's reason about horizontal containment:

1. supx(y) <= infx(x). (x is east of y)
2. infx(z) <= infx(y). (y is within z horizontally)
3. supx(y) <= supx(z). (y is within z horizontally)

From 1. and 3., we get supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)).

We don't have any constraints on supx(x), so we can't directly determine if x is horizontally within z. But it's possible for x to be horizontally within z if supx(x) <= supx(z).

if y is S of z and x is NE of y, for x to be S of z, we would need:
1. For south-ness: supy(x) <= infy(z).
2. For horizontal containment: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From our constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(z), and supy(y) <= infy(x). But we don't know the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). If supy(x) is less than or equal to infy(z), then x could be south of z. But if supy(x) > infy(z), then x can't be south of z.

Similarly, for horizontal containment, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), and supx(y) <= infx(x). We can deduce infx(z) <= infx(x) if infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). But we don't know if supx(x) <= supx(z).

Actually let me use a diagram to help me think about the horizontal constraint.

```
   |<------- z ------->|
   |                    |
   |   |<-- y -->|      |
   |   |         |      |
   |---|---------|------|
       ^         ^
       |         |
       a         b
```

In the above, a is infx(y) and b is supx(y).

Now, for x to be horizontally within z, we would need:

```
   |<------- z ------->|
   |                    |
   |       |<-- x -->|  |
   |       |         |  |
   |-------|---------|--|
           ^         ^
           |         |
           c         d
```

In the above, c is infx(x) and d is supx(x).

From our constraints, we know:

1. b <= c. (supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is east of y)

If b <= c, we get y and x don't overlap horizontally. Instead, x is to the right of y. And from the diagrams, if x is to the right of y, it seems unlikely that x is horizontally within z. But the key here is that for horizontal containment, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From 1 and 3, we get supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). But it's plausible for infx(x) <= supx(z) (which is necessary for horizontal overlap), but we'd also need infx(z) <= infx(x) for horizontal containment. From 2, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), but the relationship between infx(y) and infx(x) is not direct from our constraints. Actually, from 1, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), but that doesn't tell us about the relation between infx(y) and infx(x).

Actually from the diagram, it seems like this situation (where x overlaps with z horizontally) would occur only if infx(x) <= supx(z). That is, only if the left side of x is to the left of the right side of z. But from our constraint 1, the left side of x is to the right of the right side of y. And from our constraint 3, the right side of y is to the left of the right side of z. So, the left side of x is to the right of a point which is to the left of the right side of z. This doesn't allow us to determine if the left side of x is to the left or right of the right side of z.

Hmm, let me take a step back. Intuitively, if x is NE of y and y is S of z, then x is NE of (a point that's S of z). While this doesn't pin down the exact relationship between x and z, it does tell us that x is in a "NE direction" from (a point that's S of z). This could still place x in various positions relative to z, which is consistent with our previous reasoning.

Lemme continue double checking the other relations.

For N: x is strictly north of z and horizontally within z. This seems plausible. If x is NE of y and y is S of z, then x could be directly north of z, especially if y is directly south of z and x is just slightly to the east of y.

For NE: x is strictly northeast of z. This seems very plausible.

For E: x is strictly east of z and vertically within z. This also seems plausible. If x is only slightly north of y, such that it's still within z's vertical extent, then x could be directly east of z.

For SE: x is strictly southeast of z. This seems possible, especially if z is high enough north that even though x is NE of y, it's still SE of z.

For B: x is inside the bounding box of z. This is possible if z is large enough to contain x.

For SW, W, and NW: Given that x is NE of y and y is horizontally within z, it seems implausible for x to be strictly west of z. So, these relations appear unlikely.

So, for now I'll tentatively conclude that the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, B.

Actually, let me check S again more carefully. I think the challenge here is combining the constraints correctly. Let's try reasoning from the axioms:

1. x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
2. y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

For S: x is strictly south of z and horizontally within z. This means:
3. supy(x) <= infy(z)
4. infx(z) <= infx(x)
5. supx(x) <= supx(z)

From 1 and 2, we can derive infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This satisfies 4. And we can also note that 5 may or may not hold, depending on the respective sizes of x and z.

For 3 (supy(x) <= infy(z)), from our constraints, we know:
supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x). However, without additional information, it's difficult to deduce the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) because we don't have constraints on the height (or north-south extent) of x.

Again, I think the S relation can still be a possibility, which is consistent with our reasoning that x can be at various positions relative to z, depending on their sizes and exact placements.

Actually, let's consider a specific example where x is S of z, y is S of z, and x is NE of y:

```
   |<------- z ------->|
   |                    |
   |-------------------|
                        |
                        v
   |<-- y -->|          infy(z)
   |         |
   |---------|
      |<----- x ----->|
      |                |
      |----------------|
```

In the above, x is to the northeast of y, y is to the south of z, and x is to the south of z. This seems to satisfy our constraints.

Actually, but this doesn't violate any of our constraints, that x is NE of y means x is strictly to the north and also strictly to the east. But here (above), it seems that x overlaps with y on the north-south axis. Actually, y is above x, so x is south of y, not north. So, this doesn't satisfy the constraint that x is NE of y.

OK actually I think I've been making things harder than they need to be.

x is NE of y means x is strictly to the northeast of y. In other words, x is in the northeastern quadrant from y. This means:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is strictly east of y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is strictly north of y)

y is S of z means y is strictly to the south of z. This means:
3. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is strictly south of z)
4. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

From 2 and 3, we get:
5. supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z))

This doesn't give us a direct comparison between infy(x) and infy(z), so we don't know the north-south relationship between x and z just from our constraints.

From 1 and 4, we get:
6. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z))

Again, this doesn't give us a direct comparison between infx(x) and supx(z), so we don't know the east-west relationship between x and z just from our constraints.

Actually, I think the issue is that the geometry allows many possible relations between x and z, given the constraints that x is NE of y and y is S of z.

So, I think the possible relations are: N, NE, E, SE, S, B.

Actually, wait. Actually, let me just try numerical examples to make sure.

Example 1: z at (0, 10) to (10, 20), y at (2, 5) to (8, 9), x at (9, 11) to (15, 15).
In this case, x is E of z.

Example 2: z at (0, 10) to (10, 20), y at (2, 5) to (8, 9), x at (5, 21) to (8, 25).
In this case, x is N of z.

Example 3: z at (0, 10) to (10, 20), y at (2, 5) to (8, 9), x at (11, 21) to (15, 25).
In this case, x is NE of z.

Example 4: z at (0, 10) to (10, 20), y at (2, 5) to (8, 9), x at (11, 11) to (15, 15).
In this case, x is E of z.

Example 5: z at (0, 10) to (10, 20), y at (2, 5) to (8, 9), x at (11, 1) to (15, 5).
In this case, x is SE of z.

Example 6: z at (0, 0) to (20, 40), y at (5, -10) to (15, -5), x at (16, -9) to (18, -7).
In this case, x is B of z.

Example 7: z at (0, 10) to (10, 20), y at (2, 5) to (8, 9), x at (5, 5) to (8, 9).
Wait, in this case, x overlaps with y, which contradicts the constraint that x is NE of y. So, this example doesn't work.

Example 8 (trying to find an S example): z at (0, 10) to (10, 20), y at (2, 5) to (8, 9)...

Let me try to construct an example where x is S of z:
- For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). In our example, infy(z) = 10. So, x's top edge should be less than 10. But for x to be NE of y, we need supy(y) <= infy(x). In our example, infy(y) = 5. If x's top edge is less than 10, its bottom edge should be less than 10 as well. But for x to be NE of y, its bottom edge should be greater than or equal to the top edge of y, which is 9.

So, x's bottom edge (infy(x)) should be at least 9, and its top edge (supy(x)) should be less than 10. This gives a very narrow band for x, but it's possible. For example, x could be at (9, 9) to (15, 9.9). In this case, x is SE of z, not S as I was trying to find.

Maybe let me try different values. Let z be at (0, 10) to (10, 20), and y at (3, 5) to (7, 9). For x to be S of z and NE of y, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is NE of y)

For x to be horizontally within z, we need 0 <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= 10. For x to be east of y, we need 7 <= infx(x). For x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= 10. For x to be north of y, we need 9 <= infy(x).

For the x to be north of y, its bottom edge (infy(x)) should be at least 9. For x to be south of z, its top edge (supy(x)) should be at most 10. Given these constraints, if the height of x is minimal, then x could be at (7, 9) to (10, 10), which would make it S of z. However, for x to be strictly east of y, its left edge (infx(x)) should be greater than the right edge of y, which is 7. If infx(x) = 7, then x and y would touch at that point, which means x is not strictly east of y. So, x's left edge should be greater than 7, say 7.1. In this case, x is at (7.1, 9) to (10, 10), which is S of z. I think, actually, this is S, not SE.

Ah actually, I'm confusing myself. Let me look more closely at the definition of S.

For S: x is strictly south of z and horizontally within z. This means:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is strictly south of z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)

Let me draw again and see if this can be true for the numerical values I'm considering:

```
   |<------- z ------->|
   |    (0, 10)-(10,20)|
   |-------------------|
                       |
                       v infy(z) = 10
                        
   |<-- y -->|
   | (3,5)-(7,9)
   |---------|

      |<-x->|
      |  (7.1,9)-(10,10)
      |------|
```

Actually, in this diagram, y and x seem to overlap in the north-south dimension. Now let's check what it means for x to be NE of y. x is NE of y if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x). With the values from our example, this translates to 7 <= 7.1 (which is true) and 9 <= 9 (which is true on the boundary). In reality I would need supy(y) < infy(x) (strict inequality), so x should be at (7.1, 9.1) to (10, 10).

But then if infy(x) = 9.1, supy(x) = 10, and infy(z) = 10, then supy(x) = infy(z), which doesn't satisfy the strict inequality for "S."

Actually, let me revisit the definition of cardinal direction relation. x is S of z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(a) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This doesn't require strict inequality, so supy(x) = infy(z) is allowed.

So, if x is at (7.1, 9.1) to (10, 10) and z is at (0, 10) to (10, 20), then x is S of z. And if y is at (3, 5) to (7, 9), then x is NE of y and y is S of z.

Hence, S is a possible relation between x and z, which confirms my earlier conclusion.

To all of my checking, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, B.

Actually, I'm still a little unsure about the S relation. Let me try one more numerical check.

Let z be at (0, 10) to (10, 20), y at (3, 5) to (7, 9), and for convenience, let x be exactly midway between y and z on the north-south axis, and slightly to the east of y: x at (8, 9.5) to (9, 10).

In this case, for y, infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 7, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 9. For z, infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 10, supy(z) = 20. For x, infx(x) = 8, supx(x) = 9, infy(x) = 9.5, supy(x) = 10.

Now, for x to be NE of y, we check:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): 7 <= 8 (true)
- supy(y) <= infy(x): 9 <= 9.5 (true)

For y to be S of z, we check:
- supy(y) <= infy(z): 9 <= 10 (true)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z): 0 <= 3 and 7 <= 10 (both true)

So, our initial setup is valid. Now, for x to be S of z, we check:
- supy(x) <= infy(z): 10 <= 10 (true, though not strict)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): 0 <= 8 and 9 <= 10 (both true)

Ok, so S is a possible relation.

Ok, so I'll confirm my answer: The possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, B.

Actually, I just realized I don't have to use strict inequalities per the definitions, but wait, let me clarify:

For S: x is strictly south of z and horizontally within z. The "strictly" in the verbal description might lead one to think of strict inequalities, but the formal definition given is:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (notice the non-strict inequality)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (also non-strict inequalities)

With this in mind, when supy(x) = infy(z), x is considered strictly south of z. The cardinal direction relations are mutually exclusive, this is more in line with a partition of the space rather than strict vs. non-strict inequalities.

So, the S relation from my previous example is valid.

Ok, so my conclusion stands, the possible relations are N, NE, E, SE, S, B.

Actually, the formalization always seems to use <= (non-strict inequality) for all the cardinal direction relations, but the verbal descriptions use "strictly" (e.g., "strictly to the south of z").

Actually, wait. Reading the text more carefully, it says that the single-tile cardinal direction relation S is defined as:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

So indeed, I'll use non-strict inequalities.

So my conclusion is that the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, B.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is S of region z

First, let me break down what these relations mean:
- x is NE of y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is S of z means: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I'll analyze what positions x can have relative to z:

1. N: x can be strictly north of z if it's within z's horizontal extent but above it
2. NE: x can be strictly northeast of z if it's both east and north of z
3. E: x can be strictly east of z if it's within z's vertical extent but to the right of it
4. SE: x can be strictly southeast of z if x is far enough east of y and not too far north
5. S: x can be strictly south of z while still being NE of y (if x is just above y but still below z)
6. B: x can be inside z's bounding box if z is large enough

For example, if:
- z is at (0,10)-(10,20)
- y is at (3,5)-(7,9)
- x is at (8,9.5)-(9,10)

Then x is NE of y and y is S of z, while x is S of z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, B
