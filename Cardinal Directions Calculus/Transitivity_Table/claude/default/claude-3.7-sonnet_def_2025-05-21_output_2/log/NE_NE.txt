PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, let's recall the definition of the NE (northeast) relation:
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

This means a is to the northeast of b if a is entirely to the right of and above b.

Now, we have:
- x NE y: This means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NE z: This means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's determine what constraints these relations place on the relationship between x and z.

For the x-axis:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y NE z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)

By transitivity:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is entirely to the right of z.

For the y-axis:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

By transitivity:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x)

This means x is entirely above z.

So we know that x is entirely to the right of and above z. This satisfies the definition of x NE z.

However, the question asks for possible relations, not necessarily the only relation. Let's check if there are other possibilities.

Actually, given the constraints we've derived (supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)), the only possible relation is x NE z. This is because these constraints define the NE relation exactly.

To double check, let's verify that no other cardinal direction relations can hold:

N: This would require infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z).

NW: This would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).

W: This would require supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).

SW: This would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).

S: This would require supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).

SE: This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).

E: This would require supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which makes supy(x) <= supy(z) contradictory.

B: This would require infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z).

Let me double check the E case again. 

For relation E: This would require supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

We know:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which satisfies the first constraint for E)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (from our derivation)

The last constraint for E is supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've just established that supy(z) <= infy(x). Since infy(x) is the greatest lower bound of x in the y-coordinate, we must have infy(x) <= supy(x). Therefore:
supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x)

This gives us supy(z) <= supy(x), which is different from the supy(x) <= supy(z) needed for relation E.

Actually, I think I made a mistake in the definition of E. Let me re-verify.

The definition of E is:
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So for relation E, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established is true)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which might be true, but we don't know for sure)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which might be true, but we don't know for sure)

We know that supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x). But this doesn't tell us about the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), or supy(x) and supy(z).

Let's reconsider. The definition of NE is:
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

So, if x NE y, it means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

And if y NE z, it means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (so supx(z) <= infx(x))
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (so supy(z) <= infy(x))

This means region x is entirely to the right of and above region z, satisfying the NE relation.

However, the question asks for all possible relations. Since we've only established the minimum bounds, there's still flexibility in the exact positions of the regions. Let me check if other relations are possible.

Actually, I think the only possible relation is x NE z, given the information we have. But just to be thorough, it might be helpful to think about a specific example.

Imagine a Cartesian plane:
- If z is at the origin (0, 0), and its bounding box extends to (1, 1),
- y could be at (2, 2), with its bounding box extends to (3, 3),
- x could be at (4, 4), with its bounding box extends to (5, 5).

In this example, x is clearly northeast of z.

But let's try to see if there's any way to position the regions such that a different relation holds:

Suppose we adjust the positions while keeping the NE relationships:
- z remains at the origin, but its bounding box extends to (1, 1),
- y is at (2, 0), with its bounding box extending to (3, 1),
- x is at (4, 2), with its bounding box extends to (5, 3).

Even in this adjusted example, x is still northeast of z.

Given the constraints, I don't see any way to position the regions such that x is not northeast of z.

So, the answer is: The only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

Actually let me double check if there are other possible relations. we can't have any relation that would contradict supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

Let's go through each of the 9 relations:

1. B (bounding box): This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So x cannot be in the bounding box of z.

2. S (south): This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is above z, not below it. Also, supx(z) <= infx(x) means x is to the right of z, not bounded by it. So this can't hold either.

3. SW (southwest): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So z is not to the right of x.

4. W (west): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the condition. So x is not to the west of z.

5. NW (northwest): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But the first condition contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So x is not northwest of z.

6. N (north): This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z). So x isn't due north of z.

7. NE (northeast): As we've shown, this is the primary relation given our constraints.

8. E (east): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). While the first two conditions may be satisfied, we don't have enough information to check the third. 

9. SE (southeast): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Though we satisfy the first condition, supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So x isn't southeast of z either.

So the constraints are most consistent with relation NE, but relation E is potentially possible.

Let me re-check if E might be possible. For E, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied from our derivation)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (we're not sure, but it's possible)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (this seems to contradict our derived supy(z) <= infy(x) because typically infy(x) <= supy(x))

But, it's worth noting that the infy(x) <= supy(x) assumption is only valid if x has some height. Let me be more careful and remember that regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. So they can't be degenerate, and must have some area. Given this, it's always the case that infy(x) < supy(x) for our regions.

Given that infy(x) < supy(x), and supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derivation, we have:
supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x)

This means supy(z) < supy(x), which is different from the supy(x) <= supy(z) needed for relation E. Thus, relation E is not possible.

Given our derivation, the constraints supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) uniquely specify the relation NE. Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

Let me take a step back and think through this once more, since the problem involves regions, not just points.

We have:
- x NE y: This means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NE z: This means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we've derived:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (so z is to the left of x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (so z is below x)

Actually, oops, I made a mistake. I was thinking of "cardinal directions" in terms of the traditional compass, which gave me an intuitive sense of "northeast" as being "above and to the right". But I need to check the formal definitions given.

From the formal definitions:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

This indeed corresponds to a being northeast of b if and only if a is entirely to the right of and above b, which is consistent with my intuition.

Given our derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

These satisfy the definition of x NE z.

So, our conclusion was correct. The only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

Actually, I just realized that I might have been overthinking. Let's revisit the problem. We have:
- x NE y (x is northeast of y)
- y NE z (y is northeast of z)

Intuitively, if x is northeast of y, and y is northeast of z, then x is also northeast of z. This is because the "northeast" direction is transitive.

Of course, we've also formally proven this conclusion.

But wait, I should check for edge cases to make sure there aren't other possibilities.

Wait, I think maybe there's an issue with my previous analysis. Let me reconsider the scenario in a more systematic way.

When I say `region x is NE of region y`, I mean the entire region x is to the northeast of the entire region y. There's no partial overlap or any part of x that is not to the northeast of y.

Given:
- x NE y
- y NE z

This means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (so supx(z) <= infx(x))
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (so supy(z) <= infy(x))

These two derivations satisfy the definition of x NE z.

So, it seems the only possible relation is indeed x NE z.

Actually, let me reframe this in terms of specific regions to make sure I understand correctly.

Imagine we have:
- Region z: A square in the southwest corner of our space.
- Region y: A square to the northeast of z.
- Region x: A square to the northeast of y.

Given this setup, x is clearly also northeast of z. The question is, could there be any other valid relation?

Given the definition, for x NE z, we need x to be entirely to the right and above z. Our derivation has shown this to be the case. If we were to change the position of x to any other position, it would violate the given condition that x is northeast of y.

So, the answer is solely NE.

Actually, let me revisit the the problem statement, and make sure I'm answering the question correctly.

The question asks for the "possible" relations between region x and region z, suggesting that there might be multiple valid answers. However, as I've demonstrated, the given conditions lead to a unique relation between x and z, which is NE.

Actually, let me double check my understanding. I'm given:
- x NE y
- y NE z

This means:
- x is to the northeast of y
- y is to the northeast of z

This requires x to be to the northeast of z as well. But the question asks for "possible" relations, which suggests I need to consider all valid possiblities.

Let's try a simple diagram to check if there's anything I'm missing.

If we have z as a reference point, then the possible positions for y given that y NE z are any positions to the northeast of z.

Similarly, the possible positions for x given that x NE y are any positions to the northeast of y.

Given the transitive nature of the NE relation, x must be to the northeast of z. So, the answer is NE.

Actually  after thinking about it, there's another issue. So far I've been assuming that the NE relation is transitive. Let me check if this is indeed the case.

Given:
- x NE y means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NE z means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (so supx(z) <= infx(x))
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (so supy(z) <= infy(x))

These two derivations satisfy the definition of x NE z. Thus, the NE relation is indeed transitive.

One thing that might be confusing me, though, is that the problem mentioned "possible" relations. It might be worth reevaluating whether there's something I missed or if there are edge cases.

Wait, I realized though that  regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, but they can have complex shapes as long as they're connected and have connected boundaries.

But despite the complex shapes, if x is northeast of y, it means the entire region x is to the northeast of the entire region y. Similarly, if y is northeast of z, the entire region y is to the northeast of the entire region z.

Given these constraints, I've shown that the entire region x must be to the northeast of the entire region z, making the only possible relation NE.

So I think I'll just go with NE as my final answer. But I acknowledge that the term "possible" in the question made me think it could be multiple answers.

ANSWER:

The only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

Let me explain why:

Given:
- x NE y means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), therefore supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), therefore supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These two conditions together satisfy exactly the definition of the NE relation between x and z.
