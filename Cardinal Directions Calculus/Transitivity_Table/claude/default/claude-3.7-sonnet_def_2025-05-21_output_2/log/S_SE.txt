PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We're told that:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

And we need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

For x S y, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z.

First, for the x-coordinate:
- From x S y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y)

Combining these, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

This means that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a condition for x being E, NE, or SE of z.

Now, for the y-coordinate:
- From x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y SE z: supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, we need to relate supy(x) and infy(z) to determine the cardinal direction. We have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

But we can't directly relate supy(x) and infy(z) from these inequalities.

Let's try to reason through the possible relationships:

1. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x could be S, SE, or SW of z.
2. If infy(z) <= supy(x), and at the same time, supy(x) <= supy(z), then x could be in the B relation with z with respect to the y-coordinate.
3. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x could be N, NE, or NW of z.

Combining the x-coordinate and y-coordinate constraints:

For the x-coordinate, x can be E, NE, or SE of z.
For the y-coordinate, x can be S, SE, SW, B, N, NE, or NW of z.

The intersection of these two sets is: SE, NE, E.

Let me double-check this by drawing out a possible configuration and see if it makes sense.

For x S y:
- x is below y
- x is within the x-range of y

For y SE z:
- y is below z
- y is to the right of z

Now, if we place these regions:
- z is at the top-left
- y is at the bottom-right of z
- x is below y and within its x-range

Wait, let me reconsider. Actually, if y is SE of z, then y is both to the right of z and below z. And if x is S of y, then x is below y (and possibly below z as well). But the x-coordinate relationship between x and z is not fully determined by these constraints.

Let's be more precise with our constraints and try again.

From x S y, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From the first and third inequalities, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This implies that supy(x) <= infy(z), which is a condition for x being S, SE, or SW of z.

From the second and fourth inequalities, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

This means that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a condition for x being E, NE, or SE of z.

Combining these, x can be SE of z (since it's in both sets).

However, I think I'm missing something. Let me re-evaluate.

Actually, from the original constraints, we can't say much more than this. The Y-relationship is clear (x is below z), but the X-relationship is not fully constrained. Let me see if I can reason about this more.

OK, so for the X-coordinate:
x S y means infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
y SE z means supx(z) <= infx(y)

Combining these:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

So, we know that supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the Y-coordinate:
x S y means supy(x) <= infy(y)
y SE z means supy(y) <= infy(z)

These together suggest that supy(x) <= infy(z) (not directly, but considering the relative positions, this is a reasonable inference).

Given these constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This means x is to the right of z, which is consistent with E, NE, or SE.
- supy(x) <= infy(z): This means x is below z, which is consistent with S, SE, or SW.

The intersection gives us SE as a possible relation between x and z.

However, this seems too restrictive. Let's double-check by constructing specific examples.

Consider a scenario where:
- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2, -2), (3, -2), (2, -1), and (3, -1). This makes x S of y.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = -2, supy(x) = -1
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2

Since supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 2, x is to the right of z.
Since supy(x) = -1 < infy(z) = 1, x is below z.

Given these constraints, x is SE of z, confirming our analysis.

Let's try another scenario to check if other relations are possible:
- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (0.5, -2), (2.5, -2), (0.5, -1), and (2.5, -1). This makes x S of y (since supy(x) = -1 < infy(y) = 0 and infx(y) = 2 <= supx(x) = 2.5).

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?
- infx(x) = 0.5, supx(x) = 2.5, infy(x) = -2, supy(x) = -1
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2

Since infx(x) = 0.5 <= supx(z) = 1, x and z overlap in the x-coordinate.
since supy(x) = -1 < infy(z) = 1, x is below z.

Given these constraints, x is S of z. This contradicts our earlier analysis where we thought SE was the only possible relation.

So, let's think about this more carefully.

From x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

For the y-coordinate, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

This suggests that supy(x) <= infy(z), meaning x is below z. This is consistent with S, SE, or SW cardinal directions.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)

Combining the last two:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

This implies that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a condition for x being E, NE, or SE of z.

So, the question is: are there situations where x is S or SW of z?

For x to be S of z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The second condition is satisfied as per our above reasoning.
But the first condition needs to be checked. From our constraints, we have:
infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)

This suggests that infx(x) >= infx(y) >= supx(z). This means infx(x) >= supx(z), which is inconsistent with infx(z) <= infx(x).

Actually, we need to be more careful here. The constraints don't directly tell us the order of infx(z) and infx(x).

Let's see if I can visualize this. 

If we place the reference region z at a fixed position, and place region y to the southeast (SE) of z, then y would be to the right and below z. Now, placing x to the south (S) of y means x is below y, but within the x-range of y. Since y is to the right of z, and x's left boundary is to the right of y's left boundary, it follows that x's left boundary is to the right of z's right boundary. This would mean x is SE or E of z, depending on the exact placement. Actually, x could be S of z too. These seem to be the only possibilities.

But wait, let's visualize again to double-check the above.

z is at a fixed position.
y is SE of z, so it's to the right and below z.
x is S of y, so it's below y but within the x-range of y.

Now, the constraints say:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y)

Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). This means x is entirely to the right of z. So x can be directly east of z or southeast of z. I think you previously gave an counterexample, so let me double check the counterexample case now.

OK in the counterexample previously sketched, we have
- infx(x) = 0.5, supx(x) = 2.5, infy(x) = -2, supy(x) = -1
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2
-  infx(y) = 2

We notice that supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2, so the condition from y SE z is satisfied. And we had infx(y) = 2 <= supx(x) = 2.5, and given that infx(x) = 0.5, supx(x) = 2.5, and infx(y) = 2, it means that infx(x) = 0.5 < infx(y) = 2, which contradicts the constraint from x S y. So this counterexample is not valid.

OK so my analysis that the possible relation between x and z is SE is correct.

Let's revisit this to check my work again.

We have:
- x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can deduce:
- From x S y and y SE z, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). That's why we were concluding that x is to the east of z.

However, I realized that we haven't been considering the inequality supx(x) <= supx(y) from the constraint x S y. If we combine this with the others, can we get more insights?

Actually there's a mistake in my checking of my counterexample. Let's carefully check the requirements of x S y again:
- supy(x) <= infy(y): supy(x) = -1 <= infy(y) = 0. This is satisfied.
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y): 
  - infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 0.5 is FALSE. So this condition is not satisfied.
  - supx(x) = 2.5 <= supx(y) = 3. This is satisfied.

So, the mistake was in the x-coordinate constraint. For x S y, we need y's x-interval to contain x's x-interval. In my example, I had x's left boundary to the left of y's left boundary, which doesn't satisfy the S constraint.

Let me revise my example to make sure x S y:
- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.1, -2), (2.9, -2), (2.1, -1), and (2.9, -1). This makes x S of y.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?
- infx(x) = 2.1, supx(x) = 2.9, infy(x) = -2, supy(x) = -1
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2

since supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 2.1, x is to the right of z.
since supy(x) = -1 < infy(z) = 1, x is below z.

Given these constraints, x is SE of z.

I'm pretty confident that the relationship between x and z would be SE. However, I want to check if there are other possible cardinal directions based on the given constraints. I'll revisit my initial analysis and try to build other consistent scenarios to check other possible cardinal directions.

Actually, I need to revisit the possibility of x being S of z. For x to be S of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From x S y and y SE z, we know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

The first two constraints combined as supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts the requirement for the S relationship, which would be infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The contradiction arises from supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which would imply supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction (since supx(x) < infx(x) is impossible).

So the S relationship is not possible.

Similarly, the SW relationship is not possible because it would require supx(x) <= infx(z), which would be inconsistent with supx(z) <= infx(x).

Let's check the E relationship. For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which suggests supy(x) <= infy(z). This is inconsistent with infy(z) <= infy(x), which would be required for the E relationship. So, the E relationship is not possible.

What about NE? For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

The first condition is satisfied from our analysis. For the second condition, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But from our constraints, we can only deduce supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which doesn't tell us anything about supy(z) and infy(x). That is, from the constraints we can't place a relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

Actually I think the NE relationship should also be excluded. From the constraints, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

This suggests that x is below y, and y is below z. So, intuitively, x should be below z, which is not consistent with the NE relationship where x would be above z.

Let me try to be more precise. From the constraints, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these (not in a direct mathematical way, but more as a reasoning), it would be intuitive to infer that supy(x) <= infy(z). This would mean x is South of z (in terms of the y-coordinate), which is consistent with S, SE, and SW (not NE).

So, it seems that SE is the only possible relationship between x and z.

But if I don't rely on the intuitive reasoning, can I fully exclude the possibility of NE (or even N or NW)? Let me see.

Actually if we consider y SE z, that doesn't tell us anything about the relative position of the top boundary of z and the bottom boundary of y. So, the constraint supy(y) <= infy(z) doesn't really help us.

Similarly, the constraint supy(x) <= infy(y) just says that the top boundary of x is below the bottom boundary of y; it doesn't say anything about the relative position of the top boundary of z and the bottom boundary of x.

So, if we take these constraints at face value, there's no direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Now, can I craft an example where x is NE of z?

Let's try:
- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0.5), and (1, 0.5).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0.6), (3, 0.6), (2, 1.6), and (3, 1.6). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.1, 1.7), (2.9, 1.7), (2.1, 2.7), and (2.9, 2.7).

Let's analyze:
- For y SE z: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2, which is satisfied. and supy(z) = 0.5 < infy(y) = 0.6, which is satisfied.
- For x S y: But wait, for x to be S of y, we need supy(x) <= infy(y). Here, supy(x) = 2.7 > infy(y) = 0.6. This doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Let me revise:
- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0.5), and (1, 0.5).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0.6), (3, 0.6), (2, 1.6), and (3, 1.6). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.1, -1), (2.9, -1), (2.1, 0), and (2.9, 0). This makes x S of y.

Now, let's analyze:
- For y SE z: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(z) = 0.5 < infy(y) = 0.6. These are satisfied.
- For x S y: supy(x) = 0 < infy(y) = 0.6, infx(y) = 2 < infx(x) = 2.1, and supx(x) = 2.9 < supx(y) = 3. These are satisfied.
- For the relationship between x and z: infx(x) = 2.1 > supx(z) = 1, which means x is East of z in terms of the x-coordinate. And supy(x) = 0 < infy(z) = 0, which means x is South of z in terms of the y-coordinate.

Wait a minute...actually I messed up the coordinates. I should have defined infy(z) = 0 above, and supy(x) = 0 < infy(z) = 0 is not a strict inequality. Let me fix the coordinates again.

- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.1, -2), (2.9, -2), (2.1, -1), and (2.9, -1). This makes x S of y.

Now, let's analyze:
- For y SE z: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(z) = 1. These are satisfied.
- For x S y: supy(x) = -1 < infy(y) = 0, infx(y) = 2 < infx(x) = 2.1, and supx(x) = 2.9 < supx(y) = 3. These are satisfied.
- For the relationship between x and z: infx(x) = 2.1 > supx(z) = 1, which means x is East of z in terms of the x-coordinate. And supy(x) = -1 < infy(z) = 1, which means x is South of z in terms of the y-coordinate.

So, x is SE of z.

Let's try once more to see if I can find a scenario where x is NE of z:
- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, -3), (3, -3), (2, -2), and (3, -2). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.1, 2), (2.9, 2), (2.1, 3), and (2.9, 3).

Let's analyze:
- For y SE z: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2, which is satisfied. And supy(y) = -2 < infy(z) = 0, which doesn't make sense. If y is SE of z, then y should be below z, which means supy(y) < infy(z), not the other way around. So I have an error. In my setup above, y is actually somewhere else, not SE of z.

I need to fix this. For y to be SE of z, y should be both to the right and below z. Let's try again:
- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.1, 3), (2.9, 3), (2.1, 4), and (2.9, 4).

Let's analyze:
- For y SE z: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(z) = 1. These are satisfied.
- For x S y: But this is not consistent, because x is not below y; actually, x is above y. For x to be S of y, we need supy(x) <= infy(y), which means the top of x should be below the bottom of y. Here, infy(y) = 0 and supy(x) = 4, so supy(x) > infy(y). This would imply y is S of x (or part of a different relation), but not x S y.

That was a mistake. Let's try again with the correct constraint.

Actually let me think this through more directly. If y is SE of z, I know that y is both to the right and below z. If x is S of y, I know x is below y. So:
- If y is to the right of z (from the SE relationship), and x is below y, then x is horizontally in relation to z as "to the right," which is consistent with E, NE, or SE.
- If y is below z (from the SE relationship), and x is below y, then x is vertically in relation to z as "below", which is deeper to the south than y is. So x is vertically in relation to z as "below," which is consistent with S, SE, and SW.

Combining these, it seems that the only consistent relationship is SE. I.e., x is to the southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z would be SE.

Let me do one more doublecheck by trying to craft an example where x is not SE of z:

- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (0, -2), (1, -2), (0, -1), and (1, -1).

Let's analyze:
- For y SE z: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(z) = 1. Technically, the condition supy(y) < infy(z) is not strictly satisfied, but for cardinal directions, I believe it should be supy(y) <= infy(z). So, y is SE of z.
- For x S y: supy(x) = -1 < infy(y) = 0, which is satisfied. But, for the x-coordinate, infx(y) = 2 > infx(x) = 0, which means x is not within the x-range of y as would be required for the S relationship. Instead, x is to the left of y. So no, x is not S of y. The relation might be SW instead.

That doesn't work because x is not S of y. Let's try again:

Let me specify the exact constraints in all three cases.
For y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (i.e., y is completely to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (i.e., y is completely below z)

For x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (i.e., x is completely below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (i.e., x is within the x-range of y)

OK so we've been using the right constraints, so I'll continue:

- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.1, -2), (2.9, -2), (2.1, -1), and (2.9, -1). This makes x S of y.

Let's analyze the relationship between x and z:
- infx(x) = 2.1 > supx(z) = 1, so x is completely to the right of z. This is consistent with E, NE, or SE.
- supy(x) = -1 < infy(z) = 1, so x is completely below z. This is consistent with S, SE, or SW.

The intersection gives us SE.

Let's try a different configuration of x:

- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). This makes y SE of z.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.1, -0.5), (2.9, -0.5), (2.1, 0.5), and (2.9, 0.5). This makes x S of y.

Let's analyze the relationship between x and z:
- For y SE z: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(z) = 1. Technically, the condition supy(y) < infy(z) is not strictly satisfied, (we're comparing 1 and 1). I think I made a mistake in my definition of z. Let me reconsider:

- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), and (1, 3).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). This makes y SE of z since: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(z) = 2.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.1, -0.5), (2.9, -0.5), (2.1, 0.5), and (2.9, 0.5). This makes x S of y since: supy(x) = 0.5 < infy(y) = 0, infx(y) = 2 < infx(x) = 2.1, and supx(x) = 2.9 < supx(y) = 3.

Wait, there's still a mathematical error in my setup. For x S y, I should have supy(x) < infy(y). Here, supy(x) = 0.5 and infy(y) = 0, and 0.5 is not less than 0. So, x is not S of y. I need to make another error.

Actually, for x S y, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (i.e., x is completely below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (i.e., x is within the x-range of y)

Let me revise my setup:
- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), and (1, 3). So: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 3.
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). So: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 0, supy(y) = 1. This makes y SE of z since: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(z) = 2.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.2, -1), (2.8, -1), (2.2, -0.5), and (2.8, -0.5). So: infx(x) = 2.2, supx(x) = 2.8, infy(x) = -1, supy(x) = -0.5. This makes x S of y since: supy(x) = -0.5 < infy(y) = 0, infx(y) = 2 < infx(x) = 2.2, and supx(x) = 2.8 < supx(y) = 3.

No wait, I screwed up. I meant infx(y) <= infx(x). Let's try again.

- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), and (1, 3). So: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 3.
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1). So: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 0, supy(y) = 1. This makes y SE of z since: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(z) = 2.
- x is the unit square with corners at (2.2, -1), (2.8, -1), (2.2, -0.5), and (2.8, -0.5). So: infx(x) = 2.2, supx(x) = 2.8, infy(x) = -1, supy(x) = -0.5. This makes x S of y since: supy(x) = -0.5 < infy(y) = 0, infx(x) = 2.2 > infx(y) = 2, and supx(x) = 2.8 < supx(y) = 3.

Actually I'm still making mistakes. For x S y, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (i.e., x is completely below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) (i.e., x's x-range is contained within y's x-range)

Scratch the above. Let's be ultra-careful.
- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), and (1, 3).
So: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 3.
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1).
So: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 0, supy(y) = 1.
- I want a square x such that:
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) (i.e., x is completely below y)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (i.e., x's x-range is contained within y's x-range)

Let's say x is the unit square with corners at (2.2, -1.5), (2.8, -1.5), (2.2, -0.5), and (2.8, -0.5).
So: infx(x) = 2.2, supx(x) = 2.8, infy(x) = -1.5, supy(x) = -0.5.

Does x satisfy the constraints for x S y?
- supy(x) = -0.5 <= infy(y) = 0. Satisfied.
- infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2.2. Satisfied.
- supx(x) = 2.8 <= supx(y) = 3. Satisfied.

So, x is S of y.

Does y satisfy the constraints for y SE z?
- supx(z) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2. Satisfied.
- supy(y) = 1 <= infy(z) = 2. Satisfied.

So, y is SE of z.

Now, what is the relationship between x and z?
- infx(x) = 2.2 > supx(z) = 1, so x is completely to the right of z. This is consistent with E, NE, or SE.
- supy(x) = -0.5 < infy(z) = 2, so x is completely below z. This is consistent with S, SE, or SW.

The intersection gives us SE.

Let's try once more with a different position for x to see if we can get a relationship other than SE:

- z is the unit square with corners at (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), and (1, 3).
- y is the unit square with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 1).
- x is the unit square with corners at (-1, -1.5), (4, -1.5), (-1, -0.5), and (4, -0.5).

Does x satisfy the constraints for x S y?
- supy(x) = -0.5 <= infy(y) = 0. Satisfied.
- But for the x-coordinate, infx(x) = -1 < infx(y) = 2 and supx(x) = 4 > supx(y) = 3. So, x's x-range is not contained within y's x-range. Actually x's x-range CONTAINS y's x-range. This doesn't satisfy the constraint for x S y.

So we need to find an x with an x-range within y's x-range.

Let's just try a different approach, let's solve this more theoretically. I'll abstract the coordinates a bit.

Let's say z has coordinates infx(z), supx(z), infy(z), supy(z).
Then y, which is SE of z, has coordinates infx(y), supx(y), infy(y), supy(y) such that:
supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, x, which is S of y, has coordinates infx(x), supx(x), infy(x), supy(x) such that:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, we need to express the coordinates of x in terms of the coordinates of z or infer constraints on their relationship.

For the x-coordinate:
- From y SE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
- From x S y, we have infx(y) <= infx(x).
- Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).

This means x is completely to the right of z (i.e., supx(z) <= infx(x)), which is consistent with E, NE, or SE.

For the y-coordinate:
- From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).
- From x S y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).

We don't have a direct algebraic relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from just these two constraints.

What we do know is:
- x is below y.
- y is below z.

While this gives us an intuitive impression that x is below z, we can't directly derive supy(x) <= infy(z) from the given constraints. Perhaps there are other implicit assumptions or axioms that might help us establish this more rigorously.

Actually, no, I made an error. We already have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z). So, by transitivity, we get supy(x) <= infy(z). So we do have the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) after all.

So, for the y-coordinate, x is completely below z (i.e., supy(x) <= infy(z)), which is consistent with S, SE, or SW.

Combining the constraints from both coordinates, the possible relationships between x and z are at the intersection of (E, NE, SE) and (S, SE, SW), which is SE.

So the relation between regions x and z is SE.

OK so the only possible relationship between x and z is SE.

Actually let me sanity check. Are there any more constraints we might be mising?

x S y really refers to two things. In terms of the y-coordinate, x is below y. In terms of the x-coordinate, x is within the x-range of y. So when we substitute in our constraints more explicitly:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y in y-coordinate)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-range is contained within y's x-range)

Now, y SE z means y is to the southeast of z, which means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z in x-coordinate)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z in y-coordinate)

Now, to infer the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinate:
- From y SE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
- From x S y, we have infx(y) <= infx(x).
- Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z. This is consistent with E, NE, or SE.

For the y-coordinate:
- From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).
- From x S y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
- Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z. This is consistent with S, SE, or SW.

The intersection of (E, NE, SE) and (S, SE, SW) gives us just SE.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is SE.

ANSWER:

Looking at the given relations, I need to determine the possible cardinal directions between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:

For x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is completely below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-range is within y's x-range)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is completely to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is completely below z)

Combining these constraints:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the right of z.
- From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z.

When a region is both to the right of and below another region, it is in the SE direction.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.
