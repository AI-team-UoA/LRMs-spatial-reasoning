PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This question is asking about a composition of cardinal direction relations.

Let's set up what we know:
- Region x is East (E) of region y. This means that x is located to the east of y.
- Region y is North (N) of region z. This means that y is located to the north of z.

Now, we need to determine what are the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions in the context:

x E y means: 
supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

y N z means:
supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, I need to figure out the possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- x is East of y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y is North of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

I'll analyze the possible positions of region x with respect to region z by considering the constraints on the minimum bounding boxes of regions x and z.

From x E y:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x is vertically contained within y or extends beyond it)

From y N z:
3. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)
4. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally contained within z or extends beyond it)

Now, let's combine these constraints to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From (1) and (4):
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
This doesn't immediately give us a definitive constraint between infx(x) and supx(z). x could be to the right of z, or they could overlap horizontally.

From (2) and (3):
infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
Transitively, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means that x is above z.

So, we know that x is above z and might be to the right of z or might not. Given the definitions of cardinal direction relations, this means that x could be NE (North East) or N (North) of z.

Additionally, since supx(y) <= infx(x) from condition (1) and given that x is above z, it's also possible for x to be NE of z.

Let's double-check by considering the constraints more carefully:

From (1) and (4) again:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
We don't have a direct relation between infx(x) and infx(z), so we can't say for sure if x is completely to the right of z or if there might be a horizontal overlap. Thus, both NE and N are possible.

Wait, let's check if E is also possible. For x to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints:
- We know that supy(z) <= infy(y) (from 3) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from 2). This means supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) for x to be E of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

How about NW? For x to be NW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints:
- We know that supy(z) <= infy(y) (from 3) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from 2). This means supy(z) <= infy(x), satisfying the second condition for NW.
- But, we also know that supx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from 4). This means infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) <= infx(x). This doesn't tell us if supx(x) <= infx(z) or not. So, NW remains a possibility.

Actually, let me trace through this more carefully because I think I've made a mistake. The condition for NW would be supx(x) <= infx(z). We know from (1) that supx(y) <= infx(x), which means region x begins to the right of where region y ends. We also know from (4) that infx(z) <= infx(y), which means region z begins to the left of where region y begins. If infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), we can't guarantee that supx(x) <= infx(z). In fact, it seems more likely that infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which would mean x is to the right of z, not to the left as required for NW.

Hmm, it seems like my reasoning here is making a mistake. Let me redefine the relations and work through this more methodically.

We know:
- x E y: region x is to the east of region y. This means supx(y) <= infx(x).
- y N z: region y is to the north of region z. This means supy(z) <= infy(y).

Let's consider the bounding boxes of these regions and their relative positions.

For x E y:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x): The easternmost boundary of y is to the west of the westernmost boundary of x.
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y): The vertical extent of x is contained within or extends beyond that of y.

For y N z:
3. supy(z) <= infy(y): The northernmost boundary of z is to the south of the southernmost boundary of y.
4. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z): The horizontal extent of y is contained within or extends beyond that of z.

Now, let's derive the possible relations between x and z.

From (3), we know that supy(z) <= infy(y). From (2), we know that infy(y) <= infy(x). Transitively, this means supy(z) <= infy(x), which is a criterion for x being N, NE, or NW of z.

Let's check each possibility:

1. x N z:
   - We need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We already established supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - From (4), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and from (1) we have supx(y) <= infx(x). These two don't directly tell us if infx(z) <= infx(x). However, if infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), then infx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies the condition.
   - Similarly, for supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints from our original conditions. So, N is a possible relation.

2. x NE z:
   - We need: supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - We already established supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), we don't have direct constraints. From (4), we have supx(y) <= supx(z) and from (1) we have supx(y) <= infx(x). This means supx(y) <= min(supx(z), infx(x)), but it doesn't necessarily imply that supx(z) <= infx(x). So, NE is also a possible relation.

3. x NW z:
   - We need: supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - We already established supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), we don't have direct constraints. In fact, from (1) and (4), we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which seems to suggest that x is to the right (east) of z, not to the left (west) as required for NW. So, NW doesn't seem to be a possible relation.

Also, I'll double-check for E and SE.

4. x E z:
   - We need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From (1) and (4), we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't necessarily mean supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - From (2) and (3), we have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y), which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) for x to be E of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

5. x SE z:
   - We need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From (2) and (3), we have supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), which means supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). These don't directly tell us if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Additionally, from (1) and (4), we don't have a direct conclusion about supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - Given these uncertainties, SE remains a possibility.

Actually, let's reconsider the last one. For "x SE z", we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know from (3) that supy(z) <= infy(y) and from (2) that infy(y) <= infy(x). This means supy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(x) <= infy(z) were true, then we'd have supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), which would mean regions x and z don't overlap vertically. This seems contradictory, so I'm leaning towards saying SE is not a possibility. Actually, I no longer think SE is possible. 

This feels challenging and I'm afraid I'm still making a mistake. Let me go back to the original constraints and reason more carefully.

From x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): Region x is to the right of region y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y): The vertical extent of x is contained within or extends beyond that of y.

From y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y): Region y is above region z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z): The horizontal extent of y is contained within or extends beyond that of z.

Now, let's reason about the possible positions of region x relative to region z:

1. Vertically: 
From (3), we have supy(z) <= infy(y). From (2), we have infy(y) <= infy(x). Transitively, this means supy(z) <= infy(x), which means region x is above region z. This restricts the possible directions to N, NE, or NW.

2. Horizontally: 
From (1), we have supx(y) <= infx(x), meaning region x is to the right of region y. From (4), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), meaning the horizontal extent of y is contained within or extends beyond that of z. 

This means the horizontal position of x relative to z is not fully constrained. It could be:
   - x is to the right of z (E, NE, SE),
   - x is to the left of z (W, NW, SW),
   - or x and z might overlap horizontally (N, S, B).

Considering both the vertical and horizontal constraints together, the possible directions are the intersection of {N, NE, NW} (vertical constraint) and {E, NE, SE, W, NW, SW, N, S, B} (horizontal constraint), which gives us {N, NE, NW}.

But I'm still not entirely convinced of NW, given that x is to the right of y and y is constrained horizontally by z. Let me double-check.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This is satisfied because of the vertical constraint.
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This means x is to the left of z.

From our constraints, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1), and we also have infx(z) <= infx(y) (from 4). Transitively, this means we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This contradicts the condition for NW, which requires supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be NW of z.

Now, for x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This is satisfied.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): This means the horizontal extent of x is contained within or extends beyond that of z.

We don't have direct constraints on infx(x) relative to infx(z) or on supx(x) relative to supx(z). So, N remains a possibility.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This is satisfied.
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This means x is to the right of z.

From (1), we have supx(y) <= infx(x), and from (4), we have supx(y) <= supx(z). These don't directly give us a relation between supx(z) and infx(x). So, NE remains a possibility.

From our reasoning, the possible directions are N and NE.

I think I've been making this more compicated than it is. Let me try to simplify. First I'll consider just the setup of the problem:

- We're told that x is E of y: This means that region x is to the east (right) of region y.
- We're told that y is N of z: This means that region y is to the north (above) of region z.

Now, given these two conditions, we want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Let's visualize this scenario in a simpler way:

```
    ^ North
    |
    |
    x      (East of y)
    |
    |
    y      (North of z)
    |
    |
    z
    |
    |
    +-----> East
```

Given this visualization, we can reason as follows:

1. x is to the east of y.
2. y is to the north of z.

So, x is both north and east of z. x could be NE of z.

But there's a complication: the exact configurations of the regions can vary, and x might be directly north of z (N) without being east of it.

So the possible relations are N and NE. Let's do further checks to confirm.

For x to be N of z:
- x must be directly above z, with the horizontal extent of x contained within or extending beyond that of z.
- This is not contradicted by our constraints, so N is a possible relation.

For x to be NE of z:
- x must be both to the north and to the east of z.
- This is not contradicted by our constraints, so NE is a possible relation.

Let's double-check for other possible directions:

For x to be NW of z:
- x must be to the north and to the west of z.
- But we know that x is to the east of y, and y is constrained horizontally by z. This contradicts the requirement for x to be to the west of z, so NW is not a possible relation.

For x to be E, SE, S, SW, W, or B:
- All of these directions require x to not be strictly to the north of z.
- But we've established that x must be to the north of z, so none of these are possible relations.

In conclusion, the possible directions are N and NE.

Actually, I noticed a potential misstep by not considering the E direction.

Let's check for E:

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): x is to the right of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z): The vertical extent of x is contained within or extends beyond that of z.

We know from our vertical constraint that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the requirement for E, which needs x and z to overlap vertically. So, E is not a possible relation.

Therefore, after all this, I'm confident in my conclusion: the possible directions are N and NE.

Actually, let's be extremely careful about the NE direction. Let me double-check if it's actually truly supported by the given constraints.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This means x is above z.
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This means x is to the right of z.

From our vertical constraint, we have supy(z) <= infy(x), so the first condition is satisfied.

From out horizontal constraint, it's less clear. We have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1): x is to the right of y.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from 4): The horizontal extent of y is contained within or extends beyond that of z.

From these, we can't directly conclude that supx(z) <= infx(x). However, let's reason the following: If y is horizontally contained within z and x is to the right of y, then there's a configuration where x is to the right of z, satisfying the condition for NE. There's also a configuration where x and z overlap horizontally, which would not satisfy the condition for NE.

So, NE is possible in some configurations but not in others.

Wait a moment, my horizontal claim isn't quite right. Let's reconstruct it. If y is horizontally contained within z, and x is to the right of y, then drawing this out, x could still overlap horizontally with z, or be entirely to the right of z, in which case it would be NE.

So the possible directions are indeed N and NE.

Actually, I'm second-guessing myself here. Let me visualize these regions.

From x E y, we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) -> x is to the right of y
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) -> The vertical extent of x is contained within or extends beyond that of y.

And from y N z, we have:
3. supy(z) <= infy(y) -> y is above z
4. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) -> The horizontal extent of y is contained within or extends beyond that of z.

Let me draw a picture of what this might look like:

```
+-------+
|       |
|   y   |
|       |
+-------+
        +-------+
        |       |
        |   x   |
        |       |
        +-------+
+---------------+
|               |
|       z       |
|               |
+---------------+
```

In this diagram:
- x is to the right (east) of y.
- y is above (north) of z.
- The vertical extent of x is contained within that of y.
- The horizontal extent of y is contained within that of z.

Looking at the relative position of x and z in this diagram, x is to the north-east of z (NE).

But let's also explore other valid configurations:

```
+-------+
|       |
|   y   |
|       |
+-------+
        +---------------+
        |               |
        |       x       |
        |               |
        +---------------+
+---------------+
|               |
|       z       |
|               |
+---------------+
```

In this diagram:
- x is still to the right (east) of y.
- y is still above (north) of z.
- The vertical extent of x is still contained within that of y.
- The horizontal extent of y is still contained within that of z.
- The horizontal extent of x extends beyond that of z, placing x both to the north and the north-east of z.

Given the constraints, both N and NE seem to be valid cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Are there any other valid configurations I should consider? Let's check:

```
+-------+
|       |
|   y   |
|       |
+-------+
                +-------+
                |       |
                |   x   |
                |       |
                +-------+
+---------------+
|               |
|       z       |
|               |
+---------------+
```

In this diagram:
- x is to the right (east) of y.
- y is above (north) of z.
- The vertical extent of x is contained within that of y.
- The horizontal extent of y is contained within that of z.
- The horizontal extent of x is entirely to the right of that of z, placing x solely to the north-east of z.

So, NE is another valid relation between x and z.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Given the two constraints, x is to the east of y and y is to the north of z, the relative position of x with respect to z can be either N (if x and z overlap horizontally) or NE (if x is to the right of z). Both are valid possibilities, depending on the exact configurations of the regions.

Let me ensure I'm not missing any other possibilities. Going back to the constraints:

1. supx(y) <= infx(x) -> x is to the right of y
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) -> The vertical extent of x is contained within or extends beyond that of y.
3. supy(z) <= infy(y) -> y is above z
4. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) -> The horizontal extent of y is contained within or extends beyond that of z.

From (3) and (2), we can deduce that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This means x is above z, restricting the possible directions to N, NE, or NW.

From (4) and (1), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies that the leftmost boundary of z is to the left of the rightmost boundary of y, which in turn is to the left of the leftmost boundary of x. This is consistent with x being to the right or the east of z, but it doesn't definitively rule out an overlap.

If we consider the bounding boxes, from (4) we have supx(y) <= supx(z). Combining with (1), we get supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't give us a direct relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). So, x could be entirely to the right of z (NE) or overlap horizontally with z (N), but it can't be entirely to the left of z (NW).

So the possible directions are N and NE.

Any position except for N and NE would violate at least one of our constraints. For instance, for x to be E of z, it would need to have a vertical overlap with z, which contradicts the fact that x is above z.

I'm confident in my answer now: the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z are N (North) and NE (North East).

Let me do one final double-check with a bit of math. The constraints tell us:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) -> x is to the right of y
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) -> The vertical extent of x is contained within or extends beyond that of y.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) -> y is above z
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) -> The horizontal extent of y is contained within or extends beyond that of z.

I'll use set notation to represent the projections of regions onto the x and y axes:
- For the x-axis, the projection of region a is [infx(a), supx(a)].
- For the y-axis, the projection of region a is [infy(a), supy(a)].

The possible x-axis projections for our regions, given the constraints, can be visualized like:

```
x: [---------------]
y:      [-----]
z: [-----------------]
```

And the possible y-axis projections:
```
x:      [-----]
y: [---------------]
z:         [-----]
```

These projections should satisfy the cardinal direction relations we've identified. Let's check:

For N, x should be directly above z, with a horizontal overlap.
Looking at the x-axis, there's an overlap between x and z. On the y-axis, x is above z. So, N is a valid relation.

For NE, x should be to the northeast of z, meaning x is both above and to the right of z. Given that the leftmost boundary of x is to the right of the rightmost boundary of y, and the rightmost boundary of y is to the left of the rightmost boundary of z, it's possible for x to be entirely to the right of z. And on the y-axis, x is above z. So, NE is also a valid relation.

Just for completeness, let's check a few other cardinal direction relations:

For NW, x would need to be entirely to the left of z. But our constraints have x to the right of y, which in turn is contained within z. So, NW is not a valid relation.

For E, x would need to have a vertical overlap with z. Our constraints have x above y, which in turn is above z. So, x is above z, which contradicts the vertical overlap requirement for E. So, E is not a valid relation.

So, the possible directions are N and NE.

Actually, let's take a step back and double-check. I previously stated that the relation between x and z has to be either N or NE. Let's carefully check this using the formal definitions provided.

x N z if and only if:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (the horizontal extent of x is contained within or extends beyond that of z)

From our derived constraints, we have:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (from the vertical constraint, x is above z), which satisfies the first part of the N condition.
- We don't have direct constraints on infx(x) relative to infx(z) or on supx(x) relative to supx(z). So, while N is possible, it requires specific configurations.

x NE z if and only if:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the right and above z)

From our derived constraints, we have:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (from the vertical constraint, x is above z), which satisfies the second part of the NE condition.
- We don't have a direct constraint on the relation between supx(z) and infx(x). So, while NE is possible, it requires specific configurations.

Let me draw out the constraints more carefully to see what I can conclude:

From x E y:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (the vertical extent of x is contained within or extends beyond that of y)

From y N z:
3. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)
4. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (the horizontal extent of y is contained within or extends beyond that of z)

Using these constraints, I can derive the following for the relation between x and z:

From (3) and (2), I get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above z.

From (1) and (4), I get infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) < infx(x), satisfying the first part of the N condition. Additionally, it means x is to the right of the leftmost boundary of z.

For the second part of the N condition (supx(x) <= supx(z)), I don't have a direct constraint.

For the NE condition (supx(z) <= infx(x)), I also don't have a direct constraint.

Given that I don't have complete information for either N or NE, I'll rely on logical inference. If x is to the right of y, and y is horizontally contained within or extends beyond z, then x can be to the right of the rightmost boundary of z (making it NE) or can overlap horizontally with z (making it N).

Therefore, both N and NE are possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Let's do another check. From (1), we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and from (4), we have supx(y) <= supx(z). Combining these, I get supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)). So, supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't tell me which one is smaller, infx(x) or supx(z). So, I still can't determine a definitive relationship between infx(x) and supx(z), which means both N and NE are possible.

Actually, let me walk through this in a more direct way. We're asking what are the possible relationships for x and z, given that x E y and y N z. To do this, let me go through each of the possible cardinal directions and see which ones are consistent:

x N z:
- The condition is supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- From y N z, we have supy(z) <= infy(y). From x E y, we have infy(y) <= infy(x). Transitivity gives us supy(z) <= infy(x). So, the first part holds.
- From y N z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y). However, from x E y, we don't have a direct constraint on infx(x) relative to infx(y). So, the second part isn't guaranteed.
- From y N z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z). From x E y, we don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) relative to supx(y). So, the third part isn't guaranteed.
- But, there exists a configuration where both the second and third parts hold. So, N is a possible relation.

x NE z:
- The condition is supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
- We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x), so the first part holds.
- From x E y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). From y N z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z). From these, we can't derive a direct relation between supx(z) and infx(x). So, the second part isn't guaranteed.
- But, there exists a configuration where the second part holds. So, NE is a possible relation.

x NW z:
- The condition is supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z).
- We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x), so the first part holds.
- From x E y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). From y N z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y). Transitivity gives us infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not a possible relation.

Let's check the other cardinal directions as well:

x E z:
- The condition is supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z), unless supy(x) = supy(z) = infy(x), which is a very specific situation and not generally possible. So, E is not a possible relation.

x SE z:
- The condition is supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
- We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x). So, supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which implies supy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) if we assume infy(z) <= supy(z). So, SE is not a possible relation.

x S z:
- The condition is supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x). So, supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which implies supy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) if we assume infy(z) <= supy(z). So, S is not a possible relation.

x SW z:
- The condition is supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z).
- We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x). So, supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which implies supy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) if we assume infy(z) <= supy(z). So, SW is not a possible relation.

x W z:
- The condition is supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- From x E y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). From y N z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y). Transitivity gives us infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not a possible relation.

x B z:
- The condition is infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z), unless supy(x) = supy(z) = infy(x), which is a very specific situation and not generally possible. So, B is not a possible relation.

Based on this thorough check, the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z are N (North) and NE (North East).

Alright, let me summarize the reasoning clearly, step by step:

1. From the constraints, we know that x is E of y and y is N of z.
2. From these, we can derive that x is above z (due to transitivity of the y N z and x E y constraints on the vertical axis).
3. Horizontally, x is to the right of the leftmost boundary of z, but there isn't a definitive relationship between the rightmost boundary of z and the leftmost boundary of x.
4. Based on the above, x can either be directly above z (N) or to the northeast of z (NE).
5. Other cardinal direction relations contradict at least one of the derived constraints and hence aren't possible.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z are N (North) and NE (North East).

Actually, I realized that my directional checks were insufficient, particularly not properly checking the constraints of (1)-(4). For example, we can not directly derive from (1)-(4) how exactly supx(x) relates to supx(z). This lack of information is why both N (which requires supx(x) <= supx(z)) and NE (which doesn't have a constraint on supx(x) and supx(z)) are possibilities. Similarly, the exact relation between infx(x) and infx(z) is not constrained, which further supports both N (which requires infx(z) <= infx(x)) and NE (which also requires this).

Given the information from (1)-(4), the only cardinal directions that are definitively consistent are N and NE.

So, the answer is: N and NE.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal direction(s) region x could be in relation to region z, given the existing relationships.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From these relationships, I can derive the following constraints:

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y and x have vertical overlap/containment)

For y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z and y have horizontal overlap/containment)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- Vertically: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z
- Horizontally: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x starts to the right of where y ends

These derived constraints indicate that:
- x must be above z (restricting to N, NE, or NW directions)
- x must start to the right of y, which is horizontally contained within z (ruling out NW)

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- N (when x overlaps horizontally with z)
- NE (when x is entirely to the right of z)
