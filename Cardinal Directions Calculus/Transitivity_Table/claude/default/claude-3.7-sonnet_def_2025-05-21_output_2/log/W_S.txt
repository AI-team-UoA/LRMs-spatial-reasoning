PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's use the definitions above to solve this problem. 

We know:
- x is W of y
- y is S of z

Now, let's break down what these relations mean:

For "x is W of y":
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

For "y is S of z":
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now I need to determine what relation(s) could possibly exist between x and z.

First, I'll try to see if I can determine anything about the x-coordinates of x and z:
- From "x is W of y", we have supx(x) <= infx(y)
- From "y is S of z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y)

But I can't directly establish a relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) from these constraints.

Next, for the y-coordinates:
- From "x is W of y", we have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From "y is S of z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these, I get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means that supy(x) <= infy(z), which is a property of relations S, SW, and SE.

So, based on the y-coordinates, x could be S, SW, or SE of z. But I also need to check the x-coordinates.

Since I couldn't establish a direct relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z, I need to consider all possibilities:
- x could be to the west of z (i.e., supx(x) <= infx(z))
- x could overlap with z in the x-axis (i.e., infx(x) < supx(z) and infx(z) < supx(x))
- x could be to the east of z (i.e., supx(z) <= infx(x))

Combining the constraints from the y-coordinates and the possibilities for the x-coordinates:

1. If x is to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) and supy(x) <= infy(z):
   This corresponds to a SW relation, meaning x is SW of z.
   
2. If x overlaps with z in the x-axis and supy(x) <= infy(z):
   This corresponds to a S relation, meaning x is S of z.
   
3. If x is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)) and supy(x) <= infy(z):
   This corresponds to a SE relation, meaning x is SE of z.
   
Actually, let's be more systematic. Given the constraints, I'll check which of the 9 possible cardinal relations between x and z are consistent with the constraints.

1. B (Bounding Box):
   For x B z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   But we know that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for the B relation. So, x cannot be in the bounding box of z.
   
2. S (South):
   For x S z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), so that condition is satisfied.
   But I don't have direct constraints on infx(x) relative to infx(z) or supx(x) relative to supx(z), so S is a possibility.
   
3. SW (South West):
   For x SW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), so that condition is satisfied.
   
   For the x-coordinates, we know that supx(x) <= infx(y) (from "x is W of y") and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y is S of z").
   
   Now, if infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(z), which satisfies the condition for SW.
   But if infx(z) < infx(y), then I can't infer that supx(x) <= infx(z).
   
   I think I'm making an error here. Let's reconsider the constraints:
   
   - From "x is W of y", we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
   - From "y is S of z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y).
   
   Unfortunately, these don't directly tell us whether supx(x) is <= or > infx(z).

   [Further analysis] Actually, the provided constraints don't ensure that x is definitely SW of z. But it's a possible relation. So, SW is a possibility.
   
   Let me just draw a diagram to make sure:
   
   ```
      z
      |
      |
      y
     /
    /
   x
   ```
   
   In this case, x is SW of z. So, SW is a possibility.
   
4. W (West):
   For x W z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= supy(z), so the third condition is satisfied.
   
   However, supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for the W relation. So, x cannot be W of z.
   
   Actually, let's double check. supy(x) <= infy(z) directly contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) since if supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), then we'd have supy(x) <= infy(x), which is not possible for a valid region (as it would mean the region has zero or negative height). So, x cannot be W of z.
   
5. NW (North West):
   For x NW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for the NW relation. So, x cannot be NW of z.
   
   Let's double check. If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then we'd have supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which is not possible for a valid region. So, x cannot be NW of z.
   
6. N (North):
   For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for the N relation. So, x cannot be N of z.
   
   Let's double check. If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then we'd have supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which is not possible for a valid region. So, x cannot be N of z.
   
7. NE (North East):
   For x NE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for the NE relation. So, x cannot be NE of z.
   
   Let's double check. If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then we'd have supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which is not possible for a valid region. So, x cannot be NE of z.
   
8. E (East):
   For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for the E relation. So, x cannot be E of z.
   
   Let's double check. If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), then we'd have supy(x) <= infy(x), which is not possible for a valid region. So, x cannot be E of z.
   
9. SE (South East):
   For x SE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), so that condition is satisfied.
   
   For the x-coordinates, I don't have direct constraints that ensure supx(z) <= infx(x). But it's a possibility.
   
   Let me check with a diagram:
   
   ```
      z
      |
      |
      y
       \
        \
         x
   ```
   
   In this case, x is SE of z. So, SE is a possibility.
   
Alright, based on my analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- S (South): If x overlaps with z in the x-axis.
- SW (South West): If x is to the west of z.
- SE (South East): If x is to the east of z.

But I realize that I've run through quite a bit of analysis, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me double-check by thinking about this from a different angle.

Given that x is W of y and y is S of z, I could place x, y, and z in a 2D grid as follows:

```
     z
     |
     |
     y
    /
   /
  x
```

or 

```
     z
     |
     |
     y
      \
       \
        x
```

Just by looking at the diagrams, the relation between x and z could be SW, S, or SE.

Let's double-check again using the definitions:

For "x is W of y":
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

For "y is S of z":
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, if I want to know when x is SW of z, I need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

For the y-coordinates:
- From the given constraints, we know that supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
- Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z), which is one of the conditions for x to be SW of z.

For the x-coordinates:
- We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
- Unfortunately, this doesn't necessarily mean supx(x) <= infx(z).

So, we can't conclude definitively that x is SW of z, but it's a possible relation if supx(x) <= infx(z).

Similarly, for other relations:

For S (South), we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

For SE (South East), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Based on the given constraints, supy(x) <= infy(z), which is a condition for S, SW, and SE. For the x-axis conditions of these relations, the given constraints don't necessarily ensure they're satisfied, but they don't contradict them either.

For W, NW, N, NE, and E, the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the defining conditions of these relations, so they're not possible.

For B, the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the defining condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for the B relation, so B is not possible.

Here's a systematic check for clarity:

B (Bounding Box): For x B z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x), but we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which is a contradiction. So, B is not possible.

S (South): For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), which is satisfied from our constraints. However, we also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which are not necessarily guaranteed by the given constraints, but they're not contradicted either. So, S is a possibility.

SW (South West): For x SW z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z). The first condition is satisfied from our constraints. The second condition is not necessarily guaranteed (since we only know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)), but it's not contradicted either. So, SW is a possibility.

W (West): For x W z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, W is not possible.

NW (North West): For x NW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which, for a valid region, contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, NW is not possible.

N (North): For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) for a valid region. So, N is not possible.

NE (North East): For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The second condition contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) for a valid region. So, NE is not possible.

E (East): For x E z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The second condition contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) for a valid region. So, E is not possible.

SE (South East): For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition is satisfied from our constraints. The first condition is not necessarily guaranteed by the given constraints, but it's not contradicted either. So, SE is a possibility.

In conclusion, the possible relations between region x and region z are S, SW, and SE.

Actually, having drawn a few diagrams, I'm not sure that the relation S (South) is consistent with the constraints. Let's check in detail. And in fact, let's draw out the constraints in a diagram and check one last time.

Given that:
- x is W of y means supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is S of z means supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

If I arrange regions x, y, and z in a grid based on these constraints, the configuration might look like:

```
+-------+
|   z   |
+-------+
    ^
    |
    v
+-------+
|   y   |
+-------+
    ^
    |
    v
+-------+
|   x   |
+-------+
```

But this is just one specific configuration, and it doesn't fully represent all the possible arrangements.

Let's check the relation S (South) specifically:

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints, we can derive supy(x) <= infy(z), so the first condition is satisfied.

For the second condition, we know infx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y is S of z"). But we also know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from "x is W of y"), which means infx(x) < infx(y) (assuming the width of region x is non-zero). If infx(z) = infx(y), then we'd have infx(z) > infx(x), which contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) for the S relation. So, for the S relation to be possible, we'd need infx(z) < infx(y) to such an extent that infx(z) <= infx(x).

Hmm, here's a thought: if y's bounding box contains x's bounding box in the x-dimension, it would mean that region x is entirely to the left (west) of region y in the x-dimension. But if y is S of z, z's bounding box might contain y's bounding box in the x-dimension.

Actually, i'm making this too complicated. Let's simplify. 

I know that:
- x W y implies supx(x) <= infx(y)
- y S z implies infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, I can infer that:
supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z). But I can't directly compare supx(x) with infx(z). So, SW is a possibility if supx(x) <= infx(z), and S is a possibility if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But can both of them be true simultaneously?

Since infx(x) < supx(x) (for non-empty regions), if supx(x) <= infx(z), then infx(x) < infx(z), which contradicts the S relation's requirement infx(z) <= infx(x). So, it seems that if x is SW of z, then it can't be S of z.

Now, let's check if x can be S of z:

x W y implies:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)

y S z implies:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is satisfied from the constraints)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The constraint supx(x) <= infx(y) from "x W y" suggests that region x is strictly to the west of region y in the x-dimension. If this is the case, and y is S of z, it's hard to see how x can be S of z, especially the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x), given that y and z might overlap in the x-dimension and x is strictly to the west of y. So, while mathematically possible, it might be geometrically difficult to have x S z under the given constraints. I would say the S relation is not a possible relation between x and z.

Ok here's the problem. I'm overcomplicating things by thinking too much about the detailed layouts of the regions, which isn't necessary for this problem. Let's break it down more directly:

Given that x is W of y and y is S of z, what are the possible relations between x and z?

For x W y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (the x-coordinate of the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x and y can overlap in the y-dimension)

For y S z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (the y-coordinate of the topmost point of y is below the bottommost point of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y and z can overlap in the x-dimension)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (from "x W y" and "y S z"). This means the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z.
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from "x W y"). This doesn't directly give us any relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) or between infx(x) and supx(z).

Based on this, the only constraint between x and z is supy(x) <= infy(z), which is a property of S, SW, and SE relations. So, the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, and SE, depending on how the x-coordinates of x and z align. Let's go through each by showing a concrete configuration.

First, SW. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is SW of z. A configuration might look like:

```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+
     ^
     |
     v
    +---+
    | y |
    +---+
 ^
 |
 v
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

In this configuration, x is SW of z.

For S, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z). A configuration might look like:

```
+-------+
|   z   |
+-------+
    ^
    |
    v
+-------+
|   y   |
+-------+
^
|
v
 +-----+
 |  x  |
 +-----+
```

In this configuration, x is below z but they overlap in the x-axis, so x is S of z.

Wait, is this even possible given our constraints? supx(x) <= infx(y) (from "x W y") suggests that region x is strictly to the west of region y in the x-dimension. If this is the case, and y overlaps with z in the x-dimension, it's hard to see how x can overlap with z. Let's revisit this.

Actually, if both infx(y) = infx(z) and supx(y) = supx(z), then y and z align perfectly in the x-dimension. In that case, if supx(x) is just slightly less than infx(y) (and hence just slightly less than infx(z)), then infx(x) might be much smaller than infx(z). This can fulfill the conditions for SW. But it can't fulfill the conditions for S, because for S we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the implied infx(x) < infx(z) (from the setup).

So, upon reconsideration, I think S is not a possible relation between x and z given the constraints.

Let's check one more time. For S, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is satisfied from our constraints)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from "x W y") and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y S z"). Now, for infx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, we'd need infx(z) to be very small compared to infx(y), such that infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y).

In theory, this is possible. If z extends far to the west of y, then infx(z) can be very small, and if x is not so far to the west of y, then infx(x) can be large. But the typical constraints for S make me wonder: if x is S of z, what happened to the region betwen them? For y to be S of z, y needs to be below z, and for x to be W of y, x needs to be to the west of y. It seems geometrically difficult at best to have x S z. Let's keep thinking.

One thing I notice is that the condition for W (supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)) doesn't necessarily mean that x is strictly to the west of y. It could be that x overlaps with y in the y-dimension, meaning their bounding boxes overlap in the y-dimension.

Wait, let me re-examine the condition "a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)". This means:
1. Region a is strictly to the west of region b in the x-dimension.
2. Region a and region b can overlap in the y-dimension such that the lowest point of b is not below the lowest point of a, and the highest point of a is not above the highest point of b.

So, if x W y, x is strictly to the west of y in the x-dimension, but they might overlap in the y-dimension.

Similarly, "a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)" means:
1. Region a is strictly to the south of region b in the y-dimension.
2. Region a and region b can overlap in the x-dimension such that the leftmost point of b is not to the right of the leftmost point of a, and the rightmost point of a is not to the left of the rightmost point of b.

So, if y S z, y is strictly to the south of z in the y-dimension, but they might overlap in the x-dimension.

Given these interpretations, if x is W of y and y is S of z, here's a possible configuration:

```
+-------+
|   z   |
+-------+
    ^
    |
    v
+-------+
|   y   |
+-------+
    ^
    |
    v
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

In this configuration, x is SW of z.

Another configuration might be:

```
    +-------+
    |   z   |
    +-------+
        ^
        |
        v
    +-------+
    |   y   |
    +-------+
 ^
 |
 v
+----+
|  x |
+----+
```

In this configuration, x is SW of z.

And another:

```
+-------+
|   z   |
+-------+
    ^
    |
    v
+-------+
|   y   |
+-------+
        ^
        |
        v
        +----+
        |  x |
        +----+
```

In this configuration, x is SE of z.

I believe all of these are consistent with the constraints: x W y and y S z.

Let's check if x can be S of z with a diagram:

```
    +-------+
    |   z   |
    +-------+
        ^
        |
        v
    +-------+
    |   y   |
    +-------+
         ^
         |
         v
    +-------+
    |   x   |
    +-------+
```

In this configuration, x overlaps with z in the x-dimension, so x S z.

Wait, but if x W y, then supx(x) <= infx(y), which means the farthest right or east that x reaches is the far left or west of y. This would contradict the configuration where x is to the right of y. So, it might be that the S relation is not possible. Same issue with SE: if x is W of y, then it's to the left of y, not to the right.

Let me think through this. If x W y, then x is strictly to the west of y in the x-dimension. If y S z, then y is strictly to the south of z in the y-dimension. These constraints don't seem to restrict the relationship between x and z in the x-dimension. But if x is S of z, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Since supx(x) <= infx(y), for the S relation to hold, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y). But we also know that infx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y S z"). So, the only way for the S relation to be possible is if infx(z) <= infx(x).

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's use a concrete example:

Suppose:
- Region z: Located at {0, 0} with width and height of {2, 2}.
- Region y: Located at {0, -3} with width and height of {2, 1}.
- Region x: Located at {-3, -3} with width and height of {1, 1}.

In this configuration:
- x is W of y (supx(x) = -2, infx(y) = 0, infy(y) = -3, infy(x) = -3, supy(x) = -2, supy(y) = -2).
- y is S of z (supy(y) = -2, infy(z) = 0, infx(z) = 0, infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 2, supx(z) = 2).
- x is SW of z (supx(x) = -2, infx(z) = 0, supy(x) = -2, infy(z) = 0).

So, it seems that SW is a valid relation between x and z.

But is SE or S possible?

For x to be SE of z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), which means 2 <= -3, which is false. So, x can't be SE of z in this example.

For x to be S of z, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which means 0 <= -3 and -2 <= 2. The second inequality is true, but the first is false. So, x can't be S of z in this example.

But I need to generalize. Let's use different objects rather than specific numerical values. Let:
- Region z has bounds {infx(z), infy(z), supx(z), supy(z)}.
- Region y has bounds {infx(y), infy(y), supx(y), supy(y)}.
- Region x has bounds {infx(x), infy(x), supx(x), supy(x)}.

From "x W y", we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y S z", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

For x to be S of z, we'd need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

The first condition is satisfied from our derived constraint. For the second part, given that supx(x) <= infx(y) (from "x W y"), the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) is certainly satisfied because infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).

However, for infx(z) <= infx(x), we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y). We know that infx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y S z"), but we don't know if infx(z) is small enough compared to infx(y) such that infx(z) <= infx(x).

So, for x to be S of z, we'd need a specific arrangement where infx(z) is small enough compared to infx(y) such that infx(z) <= infx(x).

Given the flexibility of the regions, it's theoretically possible to have such an arrangement, but it's not guaranteed.

Hmm, I'm not convinced this is possible. Let me create an example where x is S of z.

Actually, can I directly work with the definitions to determine which relations are possible?

Let's investigate when x can be S of z.

For x S z, I need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

from the constraints I have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

So, supy(x) <= infy(z) is satisfied, and from supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), I can infer supx(x) <= supx(z).

For infx(z) <= infx(x), I have infx(z) <= infx(y) from "y S z" and supx(x) <= infx(y) from "x W y". Now, is it possible to have infx(z) <= infx(x) given these constraints? It might be, but I need to ensure x and z are positioned appropriately.

If infx(z) is close to infx(y) and infx(x) is much smaller than supx(x), which itself is close to infx(y), then infx(x) may still be less than infx(z). In that case, x wouldn't be S of z.

Actually, the most general constraint from "x W y" says that x is strictly to the west of y in the x-dimension, which means all the x-coordinates of region x are to the west of all the x-coordinates of region y. For "y S z", all the y-coordinates of region y are to the south of all the y-coordinates of region z.

If x is strictly to the west of y (from "x W y") and y is potentially overlapping with z in the x-dimension (from "y S z"), then x is most likely to the west of z in the x-dimension, which aligns with the SW relation.

Let's see if SE can be a possible relation.

For x SE z, I need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the constraints, I have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

While supy(x) <= infy(z) is satisfied, I can't satisfy supx(z) <= infx(x). From supx(x) <= infx(y), I infer infx(x) < infx(y) (for non-point regions). And from supx(y) <= supx(z), I infer infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).

Combining these, I get infx(x) < infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for the SE relation.

So, SE is not a possible relation between x and z.

Now, let's check S.

For x S z, I need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From the constraints, I have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

While supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (derived from supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)), I need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x).

From infx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y S z") and supx(x) <= infx(y) (from "x W y"), I get infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) (for non-point regions). This doesn't guarantee infx(z) <= infx(x). In fact, if infx(z) is slightly less than infx(y), and infx(x) is much less than infx(y), then infx(z) might be greater than infx(x), contradicting the S relation. However, if infx(z) is much less than infx(y), then it's possible for infx(z) to be less than or equal to infx(x), supporting the S relation.

Since the constraints don't force infx(z) to be any specific value less than infx(y), it's theoretically possible for infx(z) <= infx(x). Hence, S could be a possible relation.

Let's check with a concrete example. If:
- Region z has bounds {-5, 0, 5, 5}.
- Region y has bounds {0, -5, 5, -3}.
- Region x has bounds {-3, -6, -1, -4}.

Then:
- x is W of y (supx(x) = -1, infx(y) = 0).
- y is S of z (supy(y) = -3, infy(z) = 0, infx(z) = -5, infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 5, supx(z) = 5).
- x is S of z (supy(x) = -4, infy(z) = 0, infx(z) = -5, infx(x) = -3, supx(x) = -1, supx(z) = 5).

This confirms that S is a possible relation between x and z.

Now I just need to check if SW is really a valid relation:

For x SW z, I need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the constraints, I have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

While supy(x) <= infy(z) is satisfied, I need to check if supx(x) <= infx(z).

From infx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y S z") and supx(x) <= infx(y) (from "x W y"), I can't directly infer that supx(x) <= infx(z). If infx(z) is slightly less than infx(y), and supx(x) is slightly less than infx(y), then infx(z) might be less than supx(x), contradicting the SW relation.

However, if infx(z) is much less than infx(y), or if supx(x) is much less than infx(y), then it's possible to have supx(x) <= infx(z), supporting the SW relation.

Again, the constraints don't force infx(z) or supx(x) to be any specific values, so SW could be a possible relation.

Let's check with a concrete example. If:
- Region z has bounds {5, 0, 10, 5}.
- Region y has bounds {0, -5, 5, -3}.
- Region x has bounds {-3, -6, -1, -4}.

Then:
- x is W of y (supx(x) = -1, infx(y) = 0).
- y is S of z (supy(y) = -3, infy(z) = 0, infx(z) = 5, infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 5, supx(z) = 10).
- x is SW of z (supy(x) = -4, infy(z) = 0, supx(x) = -1, infx(z) = 5).

Ok, so SW is a valid relation too.

Let me also check if W is a possible relation between x and z.

For x W z, I need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the constraints, I have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

While supx(x) <= infx(z) could be satisfied (as explained earlier for SW), the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) for non-point regions.

So, W is not a possible relation between x and z.

Let me check once more, with a different perspective.

From the basic definitions:
- x W y implies that region x is strictly to the west of region y in the x-dimension, with possible overlap in the y-dimension.
- y S z implies that region y is strictly to the south of region z in the y-dimension, with possible overlap in the x-dimension.

Given these, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

I know that the top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of z (infy(z)). This implies that x is strictly to the south of z in the y-dimension, which aligns with the S, SW, and SE relations.

As for the x-dimension, there's no direct constraint on how x and z are related. If z is far to the east of y, then x is likely to be SW of z. If z overlaps with y in the x-dimension, then x could be S or SW of z, depending on the specific positioning. But certainly SE is not consistent with the constraints (because supx(x) <= infx(y), and if supx(y) <= supx(z), then supx(x) < supx(z), so it can't be the case that supx(z) <= infx(x)).

Alright, I think SW and S are the possible relations between x and z, based on the constraints. SE is not.

But actually when I review my notes, I see that I think I confirmed that SE is not possible, but I didn't verify that my example for "S" is correct.

Let me redo the example for S.

For x S z, I need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

I created this example:
- Region z has bounds {-5, 0, 5, 5}.
- Region y has bounds {0, -5, 5, -3}.
- Region x has bounds {-3, -6, -1, -4}.

I need to check that these respect the constraints we have:

1. x is W of y:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y): -1 <= 0. This is satisfied.
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y): -5 <= -6 and -4 <= -3. This is not satisfied: -5 > -6. So x can't be W of y with these bounds.

I need to adjust the coordinates. Let's try:
- Region z has bounds {-5, 0, 5, 5}.
- Region y has bounds {0, -7, 5, -3}.
- Region x has bounds {-3, -6, -1, -4}.

Now, checking:
1. x is W of y:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y): -1 <= 0. This is satisfied.
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y): -7 <= -6 and -4 <= -3. This is satisfied.

2. y is S of z:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z): -3 <= 0. This is satisfied.
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z): -5 <= 0 and 5 <= 5. This is satisfied.

3. Is x S of z?
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): -4 <= 0. This is satisfied.
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): -5 <= -3 and -1 <= 5. This is satisfied.

So, S is a possible relation.

Let's also verify SW with another example.

For x SW z, I need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

I'll create an example:
- Region z has bounds {5, 0, 10, 5}.
- Region y has bounds {0, -7, 5, -3}.
- Region x has bounds {-3, -6, -1, -4}.

Checking:
1. x is W of y:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y): -1 <= 0. This is satisfied.
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y): -7 <= -6 and -4 <= -3. This is satisfied.

2. y is S of z:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z): -3 <= 0. This is satisfied.
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z): 5 <= 0 is not satisfied.

I need to adjust the bounds:
- Region z has bounds {-1, 0, 10, 5}.
- Region y has bounds {0, -7, 5, -3}.
- Region x has bounds {-3, -6, -1, -4}.

Checking again:
1. x is W of y:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y): -1 <= 0. This is satisfied.
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y): -7 <= -6 and -4 <= -3. This is satisfied.

2. y is S of z:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z): -3 <= 0. This is satisfied.
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z): -1 <= 0 and 5 <= 10. This is satisfied.

3. Is x SW of z?
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): -1 <= -1. This is satisfied but only just.

Ok, let's try another configuration with a clearer SW relation:
- Region z has bounds {0, 0, 10, 5}.
- Region y has bounds {-2, -7, 5, -3}.
- Region x has bounds {-5, -6, -3, -4}.

Checking:
1. x is W of y:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y): -3 <= -2. This is satisfied.
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y): -7 <= -6 and -4 <= -3. This is satisfied.

2. y is S of z:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z): -3 <= 0. This is satisfied.
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z): 0 <= -2 is not satisfied.

Still need to adjust:
- Region z has bounds {-3, 0, 10, 5}.
- Region y has bounds {-2, -7, 5, -3}.
- Region x has bounds {-5, -6, -3, -4}.

1. x is W of y:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y): -3 <= -2. This is satisfied.
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y): -7 <= -6 and -4 <= -3. This is satisfied.

2. y is S of z:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z): -3 <= 0. This is satisfied.
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z): -3 <= -2 and 5 <= 10. This is satisfied.

3. Is x SW of z?
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): -3 <= -3. This is satisfied.
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): -4 <= 0. This is satisfied.

So, SW is also a possible relation.

To wrap this up, given that x is W of y and y is S of z, the possible relations between x and z are S and SW, not SE.

Hmm, okay, I think I'm overthinking this. Here's my final answer:

The possible relations between region x and region z are S and SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of cardinal directions, I need to analyze what relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

We know:
- x is W of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is strictly south of z in the y-dimension

Let's check each possible relation:

SW relation: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- The y-dimension requirement is satisfied
- For the x-dimension, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- If infx(z) is small enough, we can have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), making SW possible

S relation: Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- The y-dimension requirement is satisfied
- For the x-dimension, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied
- If infx(z) is small enough that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), then S is possible

The possible relations are: S, SW
