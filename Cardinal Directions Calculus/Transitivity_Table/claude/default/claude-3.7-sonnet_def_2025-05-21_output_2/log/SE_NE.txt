PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1) We know that region x is SE of region y. This means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2) We know that region y is NE of region z. This means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the constraints:

From (1) and (2), we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
  This means x is to the east of z (because supx(z) <= infx(x)).

For the north-south relationship, we have:
- From (1): supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From (2): supy(z) <= infy(y)

These constraints don't give us a clear ordering between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z). It means x could be north, south, or at the same latitude as z.

Given the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), x could be in one of the following directions relative to z:
- E (East): if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- NE (Northeast): if supy(z) <= infy(x)
- SE (Southeast): if supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's verify each of these possibilities to ensure they're consistent with our constraints.

E (East):
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (consistent with our derivation)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (need to check)

Based on our derived constraints, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) from (1)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) from (2)

But we don't have constraints that directly relate infy(x) to infy(z) or supy(x) to supy(z). So, E is a possible relation.

NE (Northeast):
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (consistent with our derivation)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (need to check)

We know supy(z) <= infy(y) from (2), but we don't have constraints that directly relate infy(x) to infy(y). So, NE is a possible relation.

SE (Southeast):
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (consistent with our derivation)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (need to check)

We know supy(x) <= infy(y) from (1), but we don't have constraints that directly relate infy(y) to infy(z). So, SE is a possible relation.

Wait, let's think about this more carefully.

From (2), we know y is NE of z, which means z is SW of y. This implies:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the west of y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

From (1), we know x is SE of y, which means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- For the north-south relationship, we can't make a direct inference because we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), but this doesn't give us a clear ordering between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z).

But let's think about specific cases of how x, y, and z can be arranged.

Case 1: x is E of z
This means:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've already shown)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Is this consistent with our constraints? Yes, it's possible for x to be directly east of z.

Case 2: x is NE of z
This means:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've already shown)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Is this consistent with our constraints? We know supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y), but this doesn't give us a direct comparison between supy(z) and infy(x). So, it's possible for x to be northeast of z.

Case 3: x is SE of z
This means:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've already shown)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Is this consistent with our constraints? We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), but this doesn't give us a direct comparison between supy(x) and infy(z). So, it's possible for x to be southeast of z.

Hmm, this is interesting. It seems all three directions (E, NE, SE) are possible relations between x and z, given the constraints.

Intuitively, if y is northeast of z and x is southeast of y, then x could be directly east of z (if it's at the same latitude), or northeast of z (if it's north of z), or southeast of z (if it's south of z).

Let me try to construct concrete examples for each to ensure consistency.

Example for E:
- z is at (0, 0) with bounds (0, 0, 0, 0) (just a point for simplicity)
- y is at (1, 1) with bounds (1, 1, 1, 1) (NE of z)
- x is at (2, 0) with bounds (2, 2, 0, 0) (SE of y and E of z)

This seems consistent.

Example for NE:
- z is at (0, 0) with bounds (0, 0, 0, 0)
- y is at (1, 1) with bounds (1, 1, 1, 1) (NE of z)
- x is at (2, 0.5) with bounds (2, 2, 0.5, 0.5) (SE of y and NE of z)

Hold on, this is not quite right. If x is at (2, 0.5), then it's at a higher latitude than z, but it's at a lower latitude than y. For x to be SE of y, its latitude should be lower than y, which is at (1, 1). But that would make it NE of z. So, the relation "x is NE of z" is possible.

Let me reconsider the example:
- z is at (0, 0) with bounds (0, 0, 0, 0)
- y is at (1, 1) with bounds (1, 1, 1, 1) (NE of z)
- x should be SE of y, so it's at a lower latitude than y and to the east of y. Let's say x is at (2, 0.5). But then, x is not SE of y because it's not to the south of y.

Let's make the example clearer:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (1, 1), which is NE of z.
- For x to be SE of y, x should be to the east and to the south of y. Let's say x is at (2, 0).

Now, is x SE of y? Yes, because x is to the east of y (2 > 1) and to the south of y (0 < 1).

What's the relation between x and z? x is to the east of z (2 > 0) and at the same latitude as z (both at 0). So, x is E of z.

Wait, that's not generic enough. Let me try to be more comprehensive.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is NE of z

This means:
1. x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
2. x is to the south of y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
3. y is to the east of z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
4. y is to the north of z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

From 1 and 3, we can derive: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x is to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from 2)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from 4)

But this doesn't give us a direct relation between the north-south positioning of x and z.

Let's consider the three possible north-south relationships:

1. x is to the north of z: supy(z) <= infy(x)
   Given our constraints, this is possible. For instance, if supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y).

2. x is at the same latitude as z: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   This is also possible given our constraints.

3. x is to the south of z: supy(x) <= infy(z)
   This is also possible. For instance, if supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y).

So, given the constraints, x can be:
- E of z (if they're at the same latitude)
- NE of z (if x is to the north of z)
- SE of z (if x is to the south of z)

But I think I should also consider other possibilities, not just the ones I've mentioned above.

Let's consider all 9 possible cardinal directions:

1. N (North): For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, N is not a possible relation.

2. NE (Northeast): For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x). We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x). And we've shown that it's possible for supy(z) <= infy(x) given our constraints. So, NE is a possible relation.

3. E (East): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x). And we've shown that it's possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) given our constraints. So, E is a possible relation.

4. SE (Southeast): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x). And we've shown that it's possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) given our constraints. So, SE is a possible relation.

5. S (South): For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, S is not a possible relation.

6. SW (Southwest): For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). So, SW is not a possible relation.

7. W (West): For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not a possible relation.

8. NW (Northwest): For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But we've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not a possible relation.

9. B (Bounding box): For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, B is not a possible relation.

Wait, I think I might have been a bit too restrictive in my analysis. Let me start from first principles and be more careful.

Given:
- x is SE of y, which means:
  1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
  2. supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

- y is NE of z, which means:
  3. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
  4. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Combining 1 and 3:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from 3)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1)
- Consequently, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies supx(z) <= infx(x).

This means x is to the east of z. So, x can be in one of the directions: NE, E, or SE, relative to z.

For x to be NE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (we need to check if this is possible)

From 2 and 4, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from 2)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from 4)

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). Let's see if we can construct an example where supy(z) <= infy(x).

Consider:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (1, 2)
- x at (2, 1)

In this case:
- y is NE of z: (1 > 0) and (2 > 0)
- x is SE of y: (2 > 1) and (1 < 2)
- x is NE of z: (2 > 0) and (1 > 0)

So, it's possible for x to be NE of z.

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's see if we can construct an example where infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Consider:
- z at (0, 1) with bounds (0, 0, 1, 2)
- y at (1, 3) with bounds (1, 1, 3, 3)
- x at (2, 1) with bounds (2, 2, 1, 1)

In this case:
- y is NE of z: supx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 and supy(z) = 2 <= infy(y) = 3
- x is SE of y: supx(y) = 1 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 1 <= infy(y) = 3
- x is E of z: supx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 2, infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 1, and supy(x) = 1 <= supy(z) = 2

Hmm, but this doesn't look right. Let's rethink.

I think I might be thinking too complexly. Let's approach this spatially.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is NE of z

Spatially, this means:
- y is to the northeast of z (up and to the right)
- x is to the southeast of y (down and to the right)

Combining these, x is further to the right (east) than y, which is to the right (east) of z. So, x is definitely to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship, x is below (south of) y. But y is above (north of) z. So, x can be either north or south of z, or at the same latitude.

Let's draw it:
```
    N
 W  +  E
    S

    y
   /
  /
 z---->x
```

In this diagram, y is NE of z, and x is SE of y. The relationship between x and z is that x is at the same latitude as z, so x is E of z.

But we can also have:
```
       N
    W  +  E
       S

       y
      /
     /
    z
     \
      \
       x
```
In this diagram, y is NE of z, and x is SE of y. But x is below z, making x SE of z.

Or we can have:
```
       N
    W  +  E
       S

       y
      / \
     /   \
    z     x
```
In this diagram, y is NE of z, and x is SE of y. But x is above z, making x NE of z.

Looking at these diagrams, it seems that x can indeed be E, SE, or NE of z, depending on the exact positions.

But have I exhausted all the possibilities? I think so. The relationship on the east-west axis is clear: x is to the east of z. The relationship on the north-south axis can vary.

Let me conclude. Given the constraints:
- x is SE of y
- y is NE of z

The possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are:
- E (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- NE (if x is north of z)
- SE (if x is south of z)

Ok to double check let me verify that x could not potentially be B of z or N, S, W, SW, NW, etc. of z.

For x to be B of z, x would be inside the bounding box of z. But we've already established that x is to the east of z, which means x cannot be inside z's bounding box.

For x to be N of z, x would need to be directly north of z. But we've already established that x is to the east of z, so x cannot be directly north of z.

For x to be S of z, x would need to be directly south of z. But we've already established that x is to the east of z, so x cannot be directly south of z.

For x to be W, SW, or NW of z, x would need to be to the west of z. But we've already established that x is to the east of z, so x cannot be to the west of z.

So, the only possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are:
- E (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- NE (if x is north of z)
- SE (if x is south of z)

That's the final answer.

Actually wait. Let me review the definitions provided for the 9 cardinal directions to make sure I'm applying them correctly.

For E, it says:
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

For NE, it says:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

For SE, it says:
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

So, for region x to be E of region z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is above or at the same level as z's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is below or at the same level as z's top)

For region x to be NE of region z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above z)

For region x to be SE of region z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely below z)

Looking at our derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (from our derivation)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x is SE of y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is NE of z)

These constraints don't directly tell us whether infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (for E), or whether supy(z) <= infy(x) (for NE), or whether supy(x) <= infy(z) (for SE). But depending on the exact positions, any of these scenarios is possible.

So, it seems my previous conclusion was correct: the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are E, NE, and SE.

Wait let me double check by placing regions in specific examples:

1. x E z:
   - z at (0, 0) with bounds (0, 1, 0, 1)
   - y at (2, 2) with bounds (2, 3, 2, 3) (NE of z)
   - x at (4, 0) with bounds (4, 5, 0, 1) (SE of y and E of z)

   - For y to be NE of z: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2, supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2. Yes, y is NE of z.
   - For x to be SE of y: supx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4, supy(x) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2. Yes, x is SE of y.
   - For x to be E of z: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 4, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1 <= supy(z) = 1. Yes, x is E of z.

2. x NE z:
   - z at (0, 0) with bounds (0, 1, 0, 1)
   - y at (2, 2) with bounds (2, 3, 2, 3) (NE of z)
   - x at (4, 1.5) with bounds (4, 5, 1.5, 2.5) (SE of y and NE of z)

   - For y to be NE of z: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2, supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2. Yes, y is NE of z.
   - For x to be SE of y: supx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4, supy(x) = 2.5 <= infy(y) = 2. Wait, this doesn't hold. Let me adjust.
   - Let's say y at (2, 3) with bounds (2, 3, 3, 4) and x at (4, 2) with bounds (4, 5, 2, 3).
   - For y to be NE of z: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2, supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 3. Yes, y is NE of z.
   - For x to be SE of y: supx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4, supy(x) = 3 <= infy(y) = 3. Yes, x is SE of y.
   - For x to be NE of z: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 4, supy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2. Yes, x is NE of z.

3. x SE z:
   - z at (0, 2) with bounds (0, 1, 2, 3)
   - y at (2, 3) with bounds (2, 3, 3, 4) (NE of z)
   - x at (4, 1) with bounds (4, 5, 1, 2) (SE of y and SE of z)

   - For y to be NE of z: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2, supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 3. Yes, y is NE of z.
   - For x to be SE of y: supx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4, supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 3. Yes, x is SE of y.
   - For x to be SE of z: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 4, supy(x) = 2 <= infy(z) = 2. Yes, x is SE of z.

It seems all three directions (E, NE, SE) are possible.

So to summarize, given the constraints:
- x is SE of y
- y is NE of z

The possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are:
- E
- NE
- SE

That's our final answer.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

E, NE, SE

When x is SE of y and y is NE of z, we know that:
- x must be to the east of y
- x must be to the south of y
- y must be to the east of z
- y must be to the north of z

From these constraints, we can determine that x must be to the east of z (since x is east of y, and y is east of z).

However, the north-south relationship between x and z can vary:
- x could be at the same latitude as z (giving relation E)
- x could be north of z (giving relation NE)
- x could be south of z (giving relation SE)
