PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Okay, I need to figure out the possible relations between region x and region z given that:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

Let me break down what these relations mean:

1. x is NW of y means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y is SW of z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Now, I need to determine what relations could hold between x and z. Let's analyze this:

From x being NW of y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

From y being SW of z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From the first and third lines:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z)
This means that x is to the west of z.

From the second and fourth lines:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
But this doesn't directly tell us the relative positions of x and z in the y-direction.

Let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z in the y-direction:

Case 1: infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
This, together with supx(x) ≤ infx(z), means that x is W of z.

Case 2: infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(x)
This, together with supx(x) ≤ infx(z), means that x is W of z.

Case 3: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
This, together with supx(x) ≤ infx(z), means that x is SW of z.

Case 4: supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
This, together with supx(x) ≤ infx(z), means that x is NW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- W (Case 1 and Case 2)
- SW (Case 3)
- NW (Case 4)

Wait, I'm not fully convinced by this analysis. Let me work through this more carefully.

Let's establish the coordinates of the bounding boxes of x, y, and z:
- x: [infx(x), supx(x)] × [infy(x), supy(x)]
- y: [infx(y), supx(y)] × [infy(y), supy(y)]
- z: [infx(z), supx(z)] × [infy(z), supy(z)]

Given the conditions:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which implies that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This definitely places x to the west of z.

For the y-coordinates, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x is NW of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y is SW of z)

But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z). We need to consider different cases.

Let's visualize a couple of scenarios to understand the possible positions of x relative to z.

Scenario 1: x is NW of z
In this case, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Scenario 2: x is W of z
In this case, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and there's an overlap in the y-direction between x and z.

Scenario 3: x is SW of z
In this case, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Now, let's check which of these scenarios are compatible with the given conditions:

For Scenario 1 (x is NW of z):
We have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
We also know from the conditions that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
Can we have supy(z) ≤ infy(x)? It's certainly possible that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
So, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

For Scenario 2 (x is W of z):
We have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied) and there's an overlap in the y-direction.
Given our conditions, this scenario is also possible.
So, W is a possible relation between x and z.

For Scenario 3 (x is SW of z):
We have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
From the conditions, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
Can we have supy(x) ≤ infy(z)? There's no contradiction, so it's possible.
So, SW is a possible relation between x and z.

Wait, I need to think more carefully about this. Let's revisit the scenarios.

Given our conditions:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For relation NW between x and z:
We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
From our conditions, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which gives us supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, the first requirement is met.
For the second requirement, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), there's no direct way to deduce this from our conditions. It could be true, but it's not guaranteed.
So, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

For relation W between x and z:
We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and an overlap in the y-direction.
As shown earlier, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is satisfied.
For an overlap in the y-direction, we need either infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) or infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(x). Again, our conditions don't guarantee or rule this out.
So, W is a possible relation between x and z.

For relation SW between x and z:
We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
As shown, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is satisfied.
For the second requirement, our conditions don't directly tell us about the relation between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
So, SW is a possible relation between x and z.

For other relations, like N, NE, E, SE, S, and B, I need to check if they are compatible with our conditions.

For relation N between x and z:
We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
From our conditions, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This contradicts the requirement infx(z) ≤ infx(x) for the N relation.
So, N is NOT a possible relation between x and z.

For relation NE between x and z:
We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
From our conditions, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This contradicts the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for the NE relation.
So, NE is NOT a possible relation between x and z.

For relation E between x and z:
We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
As shown, our conditions contradict the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
So, E is NOT a possible relation between x and z.

For relation SE between x and z:
We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
Again, our conditions contradict the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
So, SE is NOT a possible relation between x and z.

For relation S between x and z:
We need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
Our conditions contradict the requirement infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
So, S is NOT a possible relation between x and z.

For relation B between x and z:
We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
Our conditions contradict the requirement infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
So, B is NOT a possible relation between x and z.

Let me double-check the west relations (NW, W, SW) to ensure they are truly possible.

Actually, I think I need to be slightly more careful. Let's think more detail about what x NW of y and y SW of z imply.

For x NW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

For y SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This places x to the west of z.

For the y-coordinates, it's a bit more nuanced. From the above, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

These tell us that y is to the south of both x and z, but they don't directly specify the relative positions of x and z in the y-direction.

Let's consider the three main scenarios for the y-direction:

1. z is to the north of x: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
2. x is to the north of z: supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
3. x and z overlap in the y-direction.

All of these scenarios seem compatible with the given conditions. Thus, the possible relations between x and z would be:

- NW (if x is to the north of z)
- W (if x and z overlap in the y-direction)
- SW (if z is to the north of x)

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Wait, let me double check these claims to be sure.

For x is NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown is true)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The question is: can supy(z) ≤ infy(x) be true given our conditions?
We know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Can supy(z) ≤ infy(x)? Let's see.
If supy(z) ≤ supy(y), then supy(z) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which would satisfy the condition for x to be NW of z.
If supy(y) ≤ supy(z), then we can't directly deduce the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). But there are specific cases (e.g., a specific position of z where supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) where x could be NW of z.

So, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

Similarly, for W and SW, we would check if they are compatible with the given conditions. I'm confident that they both are, but let me check:

For x is W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown is true)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (an overlap in the y-direction).

The question is: can this overlap be true given our conditions?
We know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which is a condition for the W relation), then together with supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is consistent with our given conditions.
And if supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (another condition for the W relation), there's no contradiction with our given conditions.

So, W is also a possible relation between x and z.

Now, for x is SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've shown is true)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

The question is: can supy(x) ≤ infy(z) be true given our conditions?
We know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

These conditions don't directly tell us about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z), and there doesn't seem to be a direct contradiction. It's plausible that for some configurations of x, y, and z, we might have supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

So, SW is also a possible relation between x and z.

Ah, but wait, let's think about supy(x) ≤ infy(z) more carefully. From x is NW to y, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) but we don't have any direct information about supy(x). From y is SW to z, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(z) but again, we don't have direct information about infy(z).

So for x SW of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), and this could be true in scenarios where x is not too far to the north, and z is not too low.

For x W of z, we need an overlap in the y-direction, which means either infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) or infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(x).

For x NW of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Given that supy(y) ≤ infy(x), this would be satisfied if supy(z) ≤ supy(y). This is possible because y being SW of z doesn't give us a direct relation between supy(y) and supy(z).

Ok, so NW, W, and SW are possible. Let's do a final check to make sure no other relations are possible.

For x to be N to z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which is the condition for NW)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (an overlap in the x-direction).

we just showed that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the requirement for an overlap in the x-direction for the N relation.

So, N is not a possible relation between x and z.

For x to be NE to z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

But we've shown that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

So, NE is not a possible relation between x and z.

For x to be E to z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (an overlap in the y-direction).

Again, this contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) which we showed earlier.

So, E is not a possible relation between x and z.

For x to be SE to z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This again contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

So, SE is not a possible relation between x and z.

For x to be S to z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (an overlap in the x-direction).

This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) as well.

So, S is not a possible relation between x and z.

For x to be B (bounding box) to z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (an overlap in the x-direction).
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (an overlap in the y-direction).

But this also contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

So, B is not a possible relation between x and z.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, let me do a quick double-check on the SW relation. For SW, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). From x NW of y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x). So there's infy(x) - supy(y) ≥ 0.

From y SW of z, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z). So infy(z) - supy(y) ≥ 0.

Now, to check if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we need to determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). But from the given conditions, it's hard to directly compare supy(x) and infy(z).

Without more constraints, I think it's still valid to say that SW, W, and NW are all possible relations between x and z.

Actually, let me think: from x being NW of y, we know that the y-coordinates of x are above the y-coordinates of y. That is, infy(x) > supy(y).

From y being SW of z, we also know that the y-coordinates of z are above the y-coordinates of y. That is, infy(z) > supy(y).

Now, while infy(x) > supy(y) and infy(z) > supy(y), we can't directly compare infy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that infy(x) > infy(z), or it's possible that infy(z) > infy(x). Similarly, we can't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z) based on the given conditions.

Hence, it's possible that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is the condition for x to be SW of z.

So, I believe that the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Just to double-check: NW requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is true) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). SW requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is true) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). W requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is true) and an overlap in the y-coordinate ranges.

From the conditions, we can derive that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we don't have a direct way to determine the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z. Hence, NW, W, and SW are all possible.

Let me provide another perspective on this. We're essentially asking: if region x is in the northwest quadrant relative to region y, and region y is in the southwest quadrant relative to region z, what could be the position of region x relative to region z?

Let's draw this out in a simplified manner, where regions are represented as points for clarity.

If x is NW of y, then x is in the NW quadrant relative to y.
If y is SW of z, then y is in the SW quadrant relative to z.

From the perspective of z, y is to its southwest. From the perspective of y, x is to its northwest. This means that x can be to the direct west of z, or to the southwest of z, or to the northwest of z, depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z.

If we were to draw a grid:

```
    N
  NW|NE
W---+---E
  SW|SE
    S
```

If z is at the center, y would be in the SW quadrant, and x could be in the W, NW, or SW quadrants relative to z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW. And that matches my earlier analysis.

Actually, now I'm questioning myself. Let's revisit the definitions more rigorously:

x NW y means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (x is to the north of y)

y SW z means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  (y is to the south of z)

So, x is to the west of y, and y is to the west of z. This means that x is also to the west of z. Specifically:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

From the y-coordinates, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (x is to the north of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  (y is to the south of z)

But these don't provide a direct comparison between the y-coordinates of x and z. x could be to the north, south, or at the same height as z. Hence, the possible relations are NW, W, and SW.

So, I stick to my conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Let's test these out with specific examples:

Example 1: x NW z
- x = [0, 1] × [2, 3]
- y = [2, 3] × [0, 1]
- z = [4, 5] × [2, 3]

We have:
- x NW y because supx(x) = 1 ≤ 2 = infx(y) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 2 = infy(x)
- y SW z because supx(y) = 3 ≤ 4 = infx(z) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 2 = infy(z)
- x NW z because supx(x) = 1 ≤ 4 = infx(z) and supy(z) = 3 ≤ 2 = infy(x).

Uh, that doesn't quite work. Let me try again.

Example 1: x NW z
- x = [0, 1] × [4, 5]
- y = [2, 3] × [0, 1]
- z = [4, 5] × [2, 3]

We have:
- x NW y because supx(x) = 1 ≤ 2 = infx(y) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 4 = infy(x)
- y SW z because supx(y) = 3 ≤ 4 = infx(z) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 2 = infy(z)
- x NW z because supx(x) = 1 ≤ 4 = infx(z) and supy(z) = 3 ≤ 4 = infy(x)

That looks right!

Example 2: x W z
- x = [0, 1] × [2, 3]
- y = [2, 3] × [0, 1]
- z = [4, 5] × [2, 3]

We have:
- x NW y because supx(x) = 1 ≤ 2 = infx(y) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 2 = infy(x)
- y SW z because supx(y) = 3 ≤ 4 = infx(z) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 2 = infy(z)
- x W z because supx(x) = 1 ≤ 4 = infx(z) and infy(z) = 2 ≤ 2 = infy(x) and supy(x) = 3 ≤ 3 = supy(z)

This seems right too!

Example 3: x SW z
- x = [0, 1] × [1, 2]
- y = [2, 3] × [0, 1]
- z = [4, 5] × [3, 4]

We have:
- x NW y because supx(x) = 1 ≤ 2 = infx(y) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 1 = infy(x)
- y SW z because supx(y) = 3 ≤ 4 = infx(z) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 3 = infy(z)
- x SW z because supx(x) = 1 ≤ 4 = infx(z) and supy(x) = 2 ≤ 3 = infy(z)

That also looks right!

So, based on the examples and previous analysis, the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, I just realized I made an error in my example 1. Let's fix it:

Example 1: x NW z
- x = [0, 1] × [4, 5]
- y = [2, 3] × [0, 1]
- z = [4, 5] × [2, 3]

We have:
- x NW y because supx(x) = 1 ≤ 2 = infx(y) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 4 = infy(x)
- y SW z because supx(y) = 3 ≤ 4 = infx(z) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 2 = infy(z)
- But the relation between x and z is not NW because, to be NW, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but here we have supy(z) = 3 and infy(x) = 4, which satisfies the condition (3 ≤ 4). So x is NW of z.

So x is actually NW of z in this example. Let me try another one for x being W of z:

Example 2: x W z
- x = [0, 1] × [2, 3]
- y = [2, 3] × [0, 1]
- z = [4, 5] × [2, 3]

We have:
- x NW y because supx(x) = 1 ≤ 2 = infx(y) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 2 = infy(x)
- y SW z because supx(y) = 3 ≤ 4 = infx(z) and supy(y) = 1 ≤ 2 = infy(z)
- x W z, we require: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is satisfied as 1 ≤ 4), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which is satisfied as 2 ≤ 2), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (which is satisfied as 3 ≤ 3). So x is W of z.

I was questioning myself, but these examples do confirm that NW, W, and SW are possible relations between x and z.

To summarize, given:
- x is NW of y
- y is SW of z

we've established both through analytical reasoning and through examples that the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are: NW, W, and SW.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

W
NW
SW

These are the only possible relations because:

1. From x being NW of y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
2. From y being SW of z, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
3. Combining these, we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x must be to the west of z

For the north-south positioning:
- x could be north of z (NW relation)
- x could overlap with z in the y-direction (W relation)
- x could be south of z (SW relation)

No other cardinal relations are possible because x must be strictly to the west of z.
