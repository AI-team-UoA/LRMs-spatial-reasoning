PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Alright, I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll recall what these relations mean:
- x is W of y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y is SW of z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, I need to determine what possible relations can hold between x and z.

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) 
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can deduce:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This means x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis.

Now, let's look at the y-axis.

We know:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z)

Combining, we get:
infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

So, supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

This means x is strictly below z on the y-axis.

Given these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

The primary cardinal direction relation that satisfies both these constraints is SW (South West).

Let's check if any other cardinal direction relation can hold:

- S (South): Requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which may not be true given our constraints.
- W (West): Requires infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which may not be true given our constraints.
- B (Bounding box): Requires x to be within the bounding box of z, which contradicts our deduction that x is strictly to the left and below z.

Actually, let me reconsider. The constraints we've established are:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

These are the exact conditions for the relation "x SW z". So, the relation between x and z is SW.

But I should double-check if there are any other possible relations.

Actually, we only know that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y SW z)

I've combined these to get supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z on the x-axis. This condition is satisfied by the cardinal direction relations W, SW, and NW.

Similarly for the y-axis, we know:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z)

Combining, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z on the y-axis. This condition is satisfied by the cardinal direction relations S, SW, and SE.

Since x needs to satisfy both the x-axis and y-axis constraints, the possible relations are at the intersection of {W, SW, NW} and {S, SW, SE}, which is just SW.

But I think I might be making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider the constraints once more:

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y on the x-axis)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x overlaps with y on the y-axis)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z on the y-axis)

Combining the x-axis constraints:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
This gives us supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z on the x-axis.

Now, for the y-axis, we have:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z)

From these, we can derive:
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
Which gives us supy(x) ≤ infy(z), meaning x is below z on the y-axis.

Given these constraints, the cardinal direction relation between x and z is SW, which means x is to the South-West of z.

Actually, I think I'm missing something. Let me reconsider the constraints once more.

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y on the x-axis)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x and y overlap on the y-axis)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z on the y-axis)

Combining the x-axis constraints:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
This gives us supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z on the x-axis.

Now, for the y-axis, we have:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z)

This gives us three pieces of information, and combining the last two, we get:
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
Which implies supy(x) ≤ infy(z), meaning x is below z on the y-axis.

However, we also have infy(y) ≤ infy(x). But we don't have a direct relation between infy(x) and infy(z). So, there are multiple possibilities for the vertical positioning of x relative to z:

1. If infy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x could extend below z in the vertical direction.
2. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x might not extend as far down as z.

But irrespective of these possibilities, since supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is always below z on the y-axis.

OK, so I know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z on the y-axis)

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
- SW (South-West)
- W (West)
- S (South)

But wait, for x to be W of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) AND infy(z) ≤ infy(x) AND supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we don't have solid constraints on infy(x) vs infy(z) or supy(x) vs supy(z). So, I can't definitively say x W z.

Similarly, for x to be S of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z) AND infx(z) ≤ infx(x) AND supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we don't have solid constraints on infx(x) vs infx(z) or supx(x) vs supx(z). So, I can't definitively say x S z.

There's an important detail here. According to the definition of the Cardinal direction relation W:
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So for x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we don't have clear constraints on infy(x) vs infy(z) or supy(x) vs supy(z).

Actually, I need to be more careful here. From the constraints, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z on the y-axis)

These two conditions correspond exactly to the definition of "x SW z," where SW is the South-West cardinal direction.

But I need to check if x could satisfy the conditions for other cardinal direction relations as well. Given that x is strictly to the left and below z, it can only be in the South-West direction relative to z.

Actually, I think there's a misunderstanding on my part. The cardinal direction relations are not mutually exclusive when regions are considered. For example, a region can be both S and SE of another region if it spans across both these directions.

Let me recheck our constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z on the y-axis)

These are the only constraints we have from the given information. Now, I need to consider what cardinal direction relation(s) can satisfy these constraints.

If we go back to the definitions:
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
- a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
- a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

Given our constraints, we can be sure that x SW z is a valid relation. But what about x W z or x S z?

For x W z, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We already know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (since infy(z) ≤ supy(z)). But we don't have clear information about infy(x) vs infy(z). So, x W z is a possibility if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

For x S z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We already know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (since infx(z) ≤ supx(z)). But we don't have clear information about infx(x) vs infx(z). So, x S z is a possibility if infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Wait, there's a contradiction here: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then we can't have infx(z) ≤ infx(x), because that would imply infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which is only possible if all are equal. But that would mean the right edge of x is exactly aligned with the left edge of z, which doesn't give us a strict "South" relationship.

Similarly, if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then we can't have infy(z) ≤ infy(x), because that would imply infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is only possible if all are equal. But that would mean the top edge of x is exactly aligned with the bottom edge of z, which doesn't give us a strict "West" relationship.

So, based on our constraints, the only valid cardinal direction relation is SW. If x is W of y and y is SW of z, then x is SW of z.

But wait, I need to reconsider. It's possible for x to "span" multiple cardinal directions. Let's revisit the constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is strictly below z on the y-axis)

Given these constraints, x could be in the SW, W, or S direction relative to z, depending on the exact shape and position of x.

For instance, if x extends northward and overlaps with z in the y-direction, it could be in the W direction. If x extends eastward and overlaps with z in the x-direction, it could be in the S direction.

But there's an issue with my reasoning. The definitions of the cardinal direction relations are:
- a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
- a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which doesn't satisfy the requirements for either W or S. For W, we'd need infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and for S, we'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), both of which are not guaranteed by our constraints.

Now, the complex part is that the single-tile cardinal direction relations refer to concrete positions, but the problem states that a cardinal direction relation can be an expression R1:...:Rk, where regions can belong to different tiles.

OK, let me re-analyze this problem in terms of possible positions of the three regions.

We know:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

This means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Let's determine the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis:
x is strictly to the left of z because supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

Now, on the y-axis:
x is strictly below z because supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

With these two conditions, we can definitively say that x is SW of z.

OK, I think I've been overcomplicating things. Let's try again and be more systematic.

First, let's establish the x-axis relationship:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y SW z)
Combining these: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is to the left of z on the x-axis.

Next, the y-axis relationship:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z)
Combining the last two: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x is below z on the y-axis.

Now, I can make a table to check which cardinal directions satisfy both these constraints:

1. B (Bounding box): No, because x is not inside the bounding box of z.
2. S (South): No, because infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not guaranteed.
3. SW (South West): Yes, conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) are both met.
4. W (West): No, because infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not guaranteed.
5. NW (North West): No, because supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not guaranteed.
6. N (North): No, because infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not guaranteed.
7. NE (North East): No, because supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not guaranteed.
8. E (East): No, because supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not guaranteed.
9. SE (South East): No, because supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not guaranteed.

OK actually this is wrong. I need to consider the possibility of region x spanning multiple cardinal direction tiles relative to z.

From our constraints, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z on the y-axis)

The condition "supx(x) ≤ infx(z)" implies that x could be in the W, SW, or NW direction relative to z.
The condition "supy(x) ≤ infy(z)" implies that x could be in the S, SW, or SE direction relative to z.

The intersection of these two sets is SW. So, based on our constraints, x can only be in the SW direction relative to z.

However, we also have another piece of information:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x W y)

And from y SW z, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

There's no direct relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), which means the region x could potentially extend vertically in such a way that it overlaps with z on the y-axis. If so, x could be both SW and W of z.

Actually, I think I'm misunderstanding something. Let's review the definitions of the cardinal direction relations again.

- a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
  For x SW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Both are satisfied by our constraints.

- a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
  For x W z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and from supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we can deduce supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But we don't know the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). So, x W z is a possibility if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

But wait, from supy(x) ≤ infy(z), and knowing that infy(z) ≤ supy(z), we can deduce supy(x) ≤ supy(z). However, the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is independent of the other constraints we have.

Now, we know:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z)

We can't directly derive a relation between infy(x) and infy(z) from these. So, it's possible that infy(z) ≤ infy(x), in which case, x W z could be a valid relation.

Let's consider another example to clarify this. Imagine if:
- infy(y) is 0, and infy(x) is 1 (so infy(y) ≤ infy(x) is satisfied).
- supy(y) is 2, and infy(z) is 3 (so supy(y) ≤ infy(z) is satisfied).

In this case, infy(x) is 1 and infy(z) is 3, which means infy(x) < infy(z). This contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) needed for x W z.

But what if:
- infy(y) is 0, and infy(x) is 5 (so infy(y) ≤ infy(x) is satisfied).
- supy(y) is 2, and infy(z) is 3 (so supy(y) ≤ infy(z) is satisfied).

In this case, infy(x) is 5 and infy(z) is 3, which means infy(z) < infy(x). This satisfies the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) needed for x W z.

So, whether x W z is a valid relation depends on the specific values of infy(x) and infy(z).

OK, I think I'm being too pedantic. The best way to approach this problem is to construct a possible configuration of regions x, y, and z that satisfies the given conditions, and then check which cardinal direction relations hold between x and z in that configuration.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

Let's set up a scenario:

Let's put region z at some arbitrary position, e.g., a square with corners at (10, 10), (20, 10), (10, 20), and (20, 20). This gives:
- infx(z) = 10
- supx(z) = 20
- infy(z) = 10
- supy(z) = 20

Now, for y to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Let's make y a square with corners at (5, 5), (9, 5), (5, 9), and (9, 9). This satisfies:
- supx(y) = 9 < infx(z) = 10
- supy(y) = 9 < infy(z) = 10

Now, for x to be W of y, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Let's make x a square with corners at (1, 6), (4, 6), (1, 8), and (4, 8). This satisfies:
- supx(x) = 4 < infx(y) = 5
- infy(y) = 5 < infy(x) = 6
- supy(x) = 8 < supy(y) = 9

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
- supx(x) = 4 < infx(z) = 10, so x is to the left of z.
- supy(x) = 8 < infy(z) = 10, so x is below z.
- infy(x) = 6 is not <= infy(z) = 10, so x is not in the W direction relative to z.
- infx(x) = 1 is not >= infx(z) = 10, so x is not in the S direction relative to z.

In this scenario, x is SW of z.

OK let me try one more time.

We have the constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is strictly below z on the y-axis)

For x SW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Both are satisfied by our constraints, so SW is a valid relation.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is satisfied. We also know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not guaranteed by our constraints.

But let me see if I can derive a contradiction. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(x). This isn't necessarily a contradiction, but it would make x extremely thin in the y-direction, which is unusual.

Moreover, from infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x W y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z), we can't directly derive a relation between infy(x) and infy(z). So, x W z remains a possibility.

Let me try another approach.

From the constraints, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z on the y-axis)

From the definitions of cardinal direction relations:
- SW: supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
- W: supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
- S: supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a), and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
- NW: supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
- SE: supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
- N: supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a), and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
- NE: supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
- E: supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
- B: infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)

I'll check each cardinal direction to see if it's a possible relation between x and z:

1. SW:
   - Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z): Satisfied.
   - Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z): Satisfied.
   - So, x SW z is a possible relation.

2. W:
   - Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z): Satisfied.
   - Requires infy(z) ≤ infy(x): Not guaranteed by our constraints.
   - Requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z): Guaranteed by the fact that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infy(z) ≤ supy(z).
   - So, x W z is a possible relation if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

3. S:
   - Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z): Satisfied.
   - Requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x): Not guaranteed by our constraints.
   - Requires supx(x) ≤ supx(z): Guaranteed by the fact that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infx(z) ≤ supx(z).
   - So, x S z is a possible relation if infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

4. NW:
   - Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z): Satisfied.
   - Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x): Not guaranteed by our constraints.
   - So, x NW z is a possible relation if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

5. B, SE, N, NE, E:
   - All of these require conditions that are not guaranteed by our constraints.
   - For instance, B requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which isn't guaranteed.
   - SE, NE, and E require supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts our constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - N requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which isn't guaranteed.

OK, actually let's double check the conditions for S. We know that:
supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which is the negation of infx(z) ≤ infx(x). since infx(z) > supx(x) > infx(x).

Similarly, for W, we know that:
supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is the negation of infy(z) ≤ infy(x). since infy(z) > supy(x) > infy(x).

For NW, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), and assuming a typical scenario where infy(x) ≤ supy(x) and infy(z) ≤ supy(z), we get:
infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z)
This means infy(x) ≤ supy(z), which is the negation of supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NW z is not a guaranteed relation.

So, based on this analysis, only x SW z is a guaranteed relation. However, it might depend on the specific positioning of infy(x) relative to infy(z) as to whether x W z is a viable relation.

Ah wait, a new realization. The Cardinal direction relation is the minimum bounding box spatial relation. So given that x and z, given x W y and y SW z, we need to figure out what the possible minimum bounding box spatial relation i.e. what the cardinal direction relation between x and z can be.

OK actually let me review the definitions again and I think I may have been correct in the first place:

- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

From the definitions, for a S b, we need (i) supy(a) <= infy(b), (ii) infx(b) <= infx(a), and (iii) supx(a) <= supx(b). However, from our constraints, we know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). While (iii) is satisfied, it's not clear if (ii) is satisfied. So, x S z is a possible relation depending on the specific positions.

Similarly, for a W b, we need (i) supx(a) <= infx(b), (ii) infy(b) <= infy(a), and (iii) supy(a) <= supy(b). From our constraints, we know that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z). While (i) and (iii) are satisfied, it's not clear if (ii) is satisfied. So, x W z is also a possible relation.

Ugh I'm sorry for the confusion. Ok let me try a radically simpler approach here. From x W y and y SW z, I know that

1. x is to the left of y. Since y is to the left of z, we have that x is to the left of z. 
2. We know that the bottom of y is below the top of x, and the top of y is above the bottom of x. We know that y is below z. By constraints:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

Chaining these inequalities, we get:
infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

So, infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). In simple terms, x is below z.

Given that x is to the left of z and x is below z, the relation between x and z is SW.

Wait, let me double-check. For a SW b, we need:
- supx(a) <= infx(b)
- supy(a) <= infy(b)

We've established that supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), which satisfies both conditions for x SW z.

We know that x is to the left of z with supx(x) <= infx(z).
From infy(y) <= infy(x) (x W y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (y SW z), it's not clear if infy(z) <= infy(x).

I'm still thinking about this the wrong way.

Let me see if I can construct a concrete example with actual coordinates to clarify. Let's say:
- Region z is a square with corners at (10, 10), (20, 10), (10, 20), and (20, 20).
- Region y can be anywhere to the SW of z, so let's say it's a square with corners at (5, 5), (9, 5), (5, 9), and (9, 9).
- Region x is to the W of y, so it could be a square with corners at (1, 6), (4, 6), (1, 9), and (4, 9).

This configuration ensures that x is W of y (left of it, with y-overlap) and y is SW of z (to the left and below it).

What's the relationship between x and z?
- x is to the left of z. (supx(x) = 4 < infx(z) = 10)
- x is below z. (supy(x) = 9 < infy(z) = 10)

This matches the SW relation.

OK, I've been overthinking this. Let me simplify. Can we have x W z?

If x W z, then:
- x is to the left of z. (supx(x) <= infx(z))
- x overlaps with z on the y-axis. (infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))

From our established constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (Satisfied)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (Established)

If infy(z) <= infy(x), and we also have supy(x) <= infy(z), that would mean supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction for a valid region. So, x cannot have the relation W to z.

Now, can we have x S z?

If x S z, then:
- x is below z. (supy(x) <= infy(z))
- x overlaps with z on the x-axis. (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z))

From our constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (Satisfied)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (Established)

If infx(z) <= infx(x), and we also have supx(x) <= infx(z), that would mean supx(x) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction for a valid region. So, x cannot have the relation S to z.

How about other relations?

For x NW z:
- x is to the left of z. (supx(x) <= infx(z))
- x is above z. (supy(z) <= infy(x))

From our constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (Satisfied)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (Established)

Now, if x is below z, it can't be above z. So, x cannot have the relation NW to z.

I hope this helps now. The constraints from the problem indicate that x is to the left and below z, which matches the SW Cardinal direction relation.

But I think I just realized the answer to this question. I have been trying to narrow down the answer to a single cardinal direction relation, while the problem statement allows for a cardinal direction to be an expression R1:...:Rk.

Actually I don't think that's right. The problem is asking for the "possible relations between region x and region z", where a relation is a cardinal direction relation (e.g. any of N, S, E, W, NW, NE, SE, SW, B). It's asking which specific directions are possible.

Based on my analysis, the only possible relation is "x SW z". Here are possible mnemonic configurations of regions that can produce this pattern:
          Z
     Y
 X

Does this check out?

From the problem statement:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From the definition of W, for x W y, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (y can't extend below x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x can't extend above y)

From the definition of SW, for y SW z, we need:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From the constraints, we can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x is to the left of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x is below z.

To satisfy SW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Both are satisfied, so x SW z is a valid relation.

Can there be other relations?

For W, we also need infy(z) <= infy(x). From our constraints:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x W y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y SW z)

These don't directly relate infy(x) and infy(z) without introducing specifics about the sizes of the regions. There can be situations where infy(z) <= infy(x) and others where infy(x) < infy(z). So, W is a possible relation but not guaranteed.

For S, we also need infx(z) <= infx(x). From our constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x W y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y SW z)

These don't directly relate infx(x) and infx(z). There can be situations where infx(z) <= infx(x) and others where infx(x) < infx(z). So, S is a possible relation but not guaranteed.

For other cardinal directions, they'd require conditions that contradict our constraints (e.g., x can't be to the east of z because we know it's to the west).

So, the possible relations are: SW, W, S.

Actually, I made a mistake. Let's reevaluate the W condition.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (confirmed)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z). So, the third condition is satisfied.

But for the second condition, if infy(z) <= infy(x), and we also have supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(x). This is a contradiction for a valid region. So, x cannot have the relation W to z.

let me check again.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (confirmed)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've established that supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

The third condition, supy(x) <= supy(z), is satisfied from the chain supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z).

Now, considering the second condition, infy(z) <= infy(x):
If infy(z) <= infy(x) is true, and we also have supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(x).

But this that supy(x) <= infy(x) is a contradiction, since for a valid region, infy(x) < supy(x). I believe this means that the W relation between x and z is not valid. The second condition infy(z) <= infy(x) cannot be satisfied, since that would lead to supy(x) <= infy(x), which can't be true for a valid region.

Actually, the inequalites just mean that the regions are "compatible" with those relations, not that the regions actually have specific dimensions that satisfy the stated inequalities. So, I think having supy(x) <= infy(x) is not a contradiction, it just means that the upper bound of the projection of x on the y-axis is below the lower bound, which means the projection doesn't exist.

Mmm yes, but what does it mean for a region to have a non-existent y-projection? A region, as described in the problem statement, is a 2D entity that must be homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. By definition, it has both x and y projections, and for each, the infimum is less than the supremum. 

So, for a valid 2D region, infy(x) < supy(x) must hold. If we assume infy(z) <= infy(x) and we also have supy(x) <= infy(z) from our established constraints, then by transitivity, supy(x) <= infy(x). This contradicts the requirement for a valid 2D region. Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) cannot be true, and the W relation is not possible.

Similarly, for the S relation, the conditions are:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (confirmed)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The first and third conditions are satisfied. But for the second condition, if infx(z) <= infx(x), and we have supx(x) <= infx(z) from our established constraints, then supx(x) <= infx(x). This is a contradiction for a valid 2D region. So, the S relation is also not possible.

Thus, the only valid relation is SW.

Let's double-check:

For SW, the conditions are:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Both of these are confirmed, so x SW z is a valid relation.

Alright, from our established constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

For SW, the conditions are:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
Both are confirmed, so x SW z is a valid relation.

For W, the conditions are:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

If infy(z) <= infy(x), and we also have supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(x). This is a contradiction for a valid region. So, x W z is not a valid relation.

For S, the conditions are:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

If infx(z) <= infx(x), and we have supx(x) <= infx(z), then supx(x) <= infx(x). This is a contradiction for a valid region. So, x S z is not a valid relation.

For other directions (NW, N, NE, E, SE, B), they all involve conditions that either contradict our established constraints or lead to contradictions within the definition of a valid region. So, none of them are valid relations.

In conclusion, the only valid relation between region x and region z is SW.

But something's still bothering me. Let me re-read the question.

"If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

It's asking for "possible" relations, suggesting there might be multiple. And the cardinal direction relations divide the space around a region into 9 partitions (the 8 directions plus the region itself). 

Actually, I think I was correct initially. The possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and W.

Let's ensure I'm thinking about this correctly. If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then the minimum constraints we have are:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

These match the SW relation, so x SW z is a guaranteed relation.

I just realized that the cardinal direction relations, as described in the problem, separate the space into distinct tiles. For x SW z to be valid, x must be in the SW tile of z. By definition, it cannot be BOTH in the SW tile and the W tile or BOTH in the SW tile and the S tile. 

The earlier contradictions I derived actually makes sense. Given our constraints, x is in the SW tile of z, which means it is to the left of z (satisfying the first condition for W) and below z (satisfying the first condition for S). However, the additional conditions for W and S lead to contradictions, which means x cannot be in either the W tile or the S tile of z. Hence, the only valid relation is SW.

Actually, the definition I was using is for a *single-tile* cardinal direction relation. But the problem states that a cardinal direction relation can be an expression R1:...:Rk, where 1 <= k <= 9, so it's possible that region x can span multiple tiles relative to region z. Maybe that's why the question is asking for "possible" relations.

Actually, I think I understand now. The problem asks "If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z..." So each relation mentioned is a single-tile relation.

But when the question asks "...which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", it's asking for the possible single-tile relations that can exist between x and z, which could be multiple.

So, based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are: SW.

Actually I'll see if there's another way to think about it. Let's draw the regions:

Suppose z is a square in the positive (+x, +y) direction. Then y, which is SW of z, is somewhere in the negative x and negative y direction from z. And x, which is W of y, is in the negative x direction from y, with some overlap in the y direction.

Now, relative to z, x is definitely in the negative x direction. But in the y direction, it depends on the exact position of x relative to y. If x is such that the bottom edge of x is above the top edge of z, then x would be NW of z (negative x but positive y). But if x is positioned such that the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z, then x would be SW of z (negative x and negative y).

But we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. This aligns with the SW relation, not the NW relation. And as we've seen, having both supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) (which would be required for the W relation) and then having infy(x) < supy(x) (which is true for any valid region) leads to a contradiction.

OK I am satisfied. I think the only possible relation is SW. The exact problem statement says "If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" And the answer is: "The only possible relation is SW."

Let's verify that SW is a valid relation:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)? Yes, this follows from our constraints.
- supy(x) <= infy(z)? Yes, this follows from our constraints.

So, x SW z is a valid relation.

Let's also double-check that all other directional relations run into constraints.

For x W z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x), which together with supy(x) <= infy(z) gives supy(x) <= infy(x), a contradiction. So, x W z is not a valid relation.

For x S z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), which together with supx(x) <= infx(z) gives supx(x) <= infx(x), a contradiction. So, x S z is not a valid relation.

And due to the spatial arrangement, other directional relations like NW, N, NE, E, SE, B would also lead to contradictions.

Therefore, the only valid relation is SW.

I think the answer is SW. I need to determine which of the cardinal directions could possibly describe the relationship between region x and region z.

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z based on the given information.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

Let me analyze what these relations mean:

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y doesn't extend below x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x doesn't extend above y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  Therefore: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
  Therefore: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

For relation SW, I need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓

For relation W, I would need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✗
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ✓

For relation S, I would need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✗
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✓

The answer is: SW
