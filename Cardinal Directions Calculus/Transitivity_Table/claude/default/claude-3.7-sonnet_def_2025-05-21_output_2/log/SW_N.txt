PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step using the definitions of cardinal directions.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

I need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's use the definitions:
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now I need to see if these constraints allow me to derive any constraints between x and z.

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

Let's combine these constraints to see what we can determine about x relative to z:

1. About x's position in the x-axis relative to z:
   - From x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - From y N z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   
   This means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   But this doesn't directly tell us anything about supx(x) compared to infx(z).
   
   x could be completely to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), which would give us W, NW, or SW relations.
   Or x could partially overlap with z in the x-axis, which would allow for more relations.

2. About x's position in the y-axis relative to z:
   - From x SW y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - From y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   
   This means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   Again, this doesn't directly constrain the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).
   
   x could be south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), which would give us S, SW, or SE relations.
   Or x could be at the same level or north of z, which allows for more relations.

Let's visualize this to better understand:

If we have z at the bottom, y above it (y N z), and x to the southwest of y (x SW y), then x could be:

1. Southwest of z (SW): If x is both west of z and south of z.
2. West of z (W): If x is west of z and at the same level or overlapping with z in the y-axis.
3. Northwest of z (NW): If x is west of z and north of z.
4. South of z (S): If x overlaps with z in the x-axis and is south of z.
5. North of z (N): If x overlaps with z in the x-axis and is north of z.
6. Inside the bounding box of z (B): If x is within the bounds of z.
7. Northeast of z (NE): If x is east of z and north of z.
8. East of z (E): If x is east of z and at the same level or overlapping with z in the y-axis.
9. Southeast of z (SE): If x is east of z and south of z.

But let's be more precise. From the given conditions:

From x SW y and y N z, we know:
- x is to the west of y's western boundary: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- x is below y's southern boundary: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is above z's northern boundary: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- z extends at least as far west as y: infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- z extends at least as far east as y: supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), so it's possible that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is west of z), but it's also possible that they overlap or that x is east of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), so x and z are both below y, but their relative positions can vary.

I think we need to be a bit more careful about the constraints. Let's revisit the definitions and see if we can derive more specific constraints.

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is entirely to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is entirely to the south of y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is entirely to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z starts at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

Let me draw out the scenario to better visualize this:

```
    y (some region)
   /
  /
x (SW of y)
         \
          \
           z (S of y)
```

Actually, this visualization might not be fully accurate. Let me try to reason using the constraints directly.

From the constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y): x's rightmost point is to the left of y's leftmost point.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y): x's topmost point is below y's bottommost point.
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y): z's topmost point is below y's bottommost point.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y): z's leftmost point is to the left of (or at the same position as) y's leftmost point.
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z): y's rightmost point is to the left of (or at the same position as) z's rightmost point.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is west of z. This is possible if infx(z) ≥ infx(y), which is a valid scenario.
2. If infx(x) ≥ supx(z), then x is east of z. This seems unlikely given the constraints, but let's check.
3. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is south of z. This is a valid scenario.
4. If infy(x) ≥ supy(z), then x is north of z. This seems unlikely given the constraints.

Let's think about this differently. The constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(y) means x is to the west of y. The constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(y) means z extends at least as far west as y. These two constraints don't directly tell us about the relative positions of x and z in the x-axis. Similarly, for the y-axis.

I think the issue is that the constraints don't uniquely determine the positions. Let's consider some specific scenarios to see what's possible:

Scenario 1: z is much wider than y, extending far to the west, but its northernmost point is just below y. In this case, x might be within the bounds of z, giving an B relation.

Scenario 2: z is just below y and doesn't extend much to the west. In this case, x might be to the west of z, giving a W relation.

Scenario 3: z is shifted slightly to the east relative to y. In this case, x might be to the southwest of z, giving a SW relation.

And so on...

Actually let's more directly see where each region can be by considering any of these scenarios:

We know that:
- Region x is SW of region y, which means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- Region y is N of region z, which means supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Let's think about the relative positions of the minimum bounding boxes of x, y, and z.

For y being N of z:
```
+-----------------+
|        y        |
+-----------------+
        ...
+-----------------+
|        z        |
+-----------------+
```

And with x being SW of y:
```
                +-----------------+
                |        y        |
                +-----------------+
+-----------------+    ...
|        x        |+-----------------+
+-----------------+|        z        |
                   +-----------------+
```

But we only know that infx(z) ≤ infx(y), so z could extend further west than shown. And we know that supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so z could extend further east than shown.

There's a wide range of possible configurations. Let's enumerate the possibilities by considering the relative positions in the x and y axes separately.

In the x-axis:
- If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z.
- If infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x overlaps with z on the left.
- If infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x), then z is within x in the x-axis.
- If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is within z in the x-axis.
- If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x), then x overlaps with z on the right.
- If infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is to the east of z.

In the y-axis:
- If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is to the south of z.
- If infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x overlaps with z at the bottom.
- If infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x), then z is within x in the y-axis.
- If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is within z in the y-axis.
- If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x), then x overlaps with z at the top.
- If infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is to the north of z.

Given the constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), we cannot determine the relative positions of x and z in the x-axis directly.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), we know that both x and z are below y, but we can't determine their relative positions in the y-axis directly.

Hmm, I think this might be one of those cases where multiple possibilities exist, and we need to enumerate them. Let me try to reason from a different angle.

Given that x is SW of y and y is N of z, we can deduce that:
- x is to the west of y
- x is to the south of y
- y is to the north of z

If we try to place these regions on a grid, then we'd have y on the top, z below it, and x to the southwest of y. This doesn't immediately tell us the relation between x and z.

Let's consider some specific scenarios:

1. If z is narrow and directly below y, x would be to the west of z, i.e. relation x W z.
2. If z extends far to the west, x could be inside the bounding box of z, i.e. relation x B z.
3. If z is shifted to the east, x would be to the southwest of z, i.e. relation x SW z.
4. If z is very small and to the east side of y, x could be to the northwest of z, i.e. relation x NW z.

Hmm ok this is getting sort of complicated. Let me try a more direct approach based on the constraints.

But actually it starts to sound like there are multiple possible relations here. Let me go through them more carefully:

From our constraints of x SW y and y N z:
- In the x-axis: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- In the y-axis: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

This means, in the x-axis:
- x is to the west of y
- z extends at least as far west as y, and at least as far east as y

And in the y-axis:
- x is to the south of y
- z is to the south of y

Given these constraints, let's see what are the possible relations between x and z:

1. x SW z: This is possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
2. x W z: This is possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
3. x NW z: This is possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
4. x S z: This is possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
5. x B z: This is possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
6. x N z: This is possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
7. x SE z: This is possible if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
8. x E z: This is possible if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
9. x NE z: This is possible if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

But the question is which of these are compatible with our constraints? Let's check each:

For x SW z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't directly tell us if supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Similarly, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't directly tell us if supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, we can't rule out x SW z based on our constraints.

For x W z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Again, our constraints don't directly tell us if these relations hold, so we can't rule out x W z.

And the same goes for the others. Without more specific constraints, we can't definitively rule out any of the nine basic cardinal relations.

So, the answer would be that there are multiple possible relations between x and z given the information. But let's think more carefully about whether any are impossible.

For x to be NE of z, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) from x SW y, and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) from y N z. This doesn't directly constrain infx(x) relative to supx(z). Similarly, for the y-axis. So, x NE z is a possibility.

For x to be E of z, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Again, our constraints don't directly tell us if these relations hold, so x E z is also a possibility.

And the same for the other relations: N, SE, B, S, W, SW, and NW. Without more specific information, all the cardinal relations are possible between x and z.

Hmm, now I don't think that is right. Let's take a step back and look at what we know:

- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the definition of SW: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). This means that region x is entirely to the left of and below region y.

From the definition of N: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z). This means that region z is entirely below region y, and z extends at least as far leftward and rightward as y.

Given that, can x be NE of z? For x to be NE of z, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Let's check:

- We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y). If infx(x) > supx(z), then infx(x) > supx(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y), which means supx(z) < infx(y). But we also know supx(y) ≤ supx(z) from y N z, which implies infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). This is a contradiction. So, x can't be E or NE of z.

Let's check if x can be SE of z. For this, we'd need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We've already shown that x can't be east of z, so x can't be SE of z.

Can x be N of z? For this, we'd need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We've established that x can't be east of z. Since N requires x to be above z, but not to the east or west, x must overlap with z in the x-direction, i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). If infx(x) ≥ infx(z), then this configuration is possible.

Let's start from a general scenario, and then we can reason about the specific directions.

Given:
- x is SW of y, meaning supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is N of z, meaning supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Let's visualize this as follows:

```
   left            right
top +----------------+ y
    |                |
    +----------------+
              ...
    +----------------+ z
    |                |
    +----------------+
    
    +--+ x
    |  |
    +--+
```

We know x is to the left of y and below it. And z is below y and extends at least as far to the left and right as y does.

Now, let's reason about the possible relative positions of x and z:

1. x is SW of z: If x is to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), then x is SW of z. We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z). So, if infx(z) = infx(y) (i.e., z and y align on the left), then x would be to the left of z. This is one possible scenario.

2. x is W of z: This means x is to the left of z and vertically aligned with it. Given our constraints, this is possible.

3. x is NW of z: This means x is to the left of z and above it. Given our constraints, for x to be above z, we'd need infy(x) ≥ supy(z). We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z). So, both x and z are below y, but their relative vertical positions can vary. The constraints don't directly tell us if x is above, below, or aligned with z. So, x NW z is a possibility.

4. x is S of z: This means x is below z and horizontally aligned with it. Given our constraints, this is possible.

5. x is B of z: This means x is inside the bounding box of z. If z extends far enough to the left (say infx(z) ≤ infx(x)), and x is within the vertical bounds of z, then x B z is possible.

6. x is N of z: This means x is above z and horizontally aligned with it. As discussed earlier, the constraints don't directly tell us if x is above, below, or aligned with z. So, x N z is a possibility.

7. x is SE of z: This would mean x is to the right of z and below it. We've already established that x can't be east of z, given our constraints. So, x SE z is not a possibility.

8. x is E of z: This would mean x is to the right of z and vertically aligned with it. Again, x can't be east of z, so this is not a possibility.

9. x is NE of z: This would mean x is to the right of z and above it. Again, x can't be east of z, so this is not a possibility.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, NW, S, B, and N. The relations SE, E, and NE aren't possible.

But wait, let's double-check the reasoning for why x can't be to the east of z. We have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

So, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

We're trying to check if x could be to the east of z, which would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we already established that supx(x) ≤ supx(z). For both supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) to be true, we'd need infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which implies everything is equal. But this violates the strict inequality in the definition of the E relation. So, x can't be to the east of z, which means x can't be E, NE, or SE of z.

Let me recheck: For x E z, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z). So, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). For x to be to the east of z, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we already established supx(x) ≤ supx(z). For both supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) to be true, we'd need supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x), which violates the strict inequality in the definition of the E relation. So, x can't be E, NE, or SE of z.

Actually, the more I think about it, the definition of East (E) relation says that: a E b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b). Region a is east of region b if and only if a is completely to the right of b, and the projection of a on the y-axis is contained in the projection of b on the y-axis.

So for x E z, we'd need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Now, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

This means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

For x E z, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we've just shown that supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The only way both statements can be true is if supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x), which logically is impossible for a region (because infx(x) < supx(x)). So, x can't be E, NE, or SE of z.

So to recap, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, NW, S, B, and N. The relations SE, E, and NE aren't possible.

Let me double-check the possibility of x being S, B, or N of z. For these, x would need to overlap with z in the x-axis.

For x S z: We'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z). If infx(z) < supx(x) ≤ infx(y), then x and z would overlap in the x-axis. And given that both x and z are below y, their relative vertical positions can vary, So, x S z is possible.

For x B z: Similarly, if x overlaps with z in the x-axis and is within the vertical bounds of z, then x B z is possible.

For x N z: If x overlaps with z in the x-axis and is above z, then x N z is possible.

OK so to recap, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, NW, S, B, and N. The relations SE, E, and NE aren't possible.

Actually let me check one more time why x can't be E of z.

For x E z: We'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

We know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

The constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(y) means that x is to the left of y. The constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(y) means that z extends at least as far leftward as y. These constraints don't directly tell us if x is to the left, right, or overlapping with z.

Let me try to understand this better with a simple example. If y is represented by the box from (5, 5) to (10, 10), z might be the box from (5, 0) to (10, 5). Given that x is SW of y, x might be the box from (0, 0) to (4, 4).

In this case, x is W of z. But let's say z is wider, from (3, 0) to (10, 5). Now, x overlaps with z, potentially giving an B relation.

So, the relative position of x and z depends on how far z extends to the left. If z extends further left than the rightmost point of x, then x would overlap with z in the x-axis. Otherwise, x would be to the west of z.

I was misinterpreting the constraints earlier. Let's revisit. We have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

These constraints don't directly tell us if x is to the left, right, or overlapping with z. The constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(y) means x is to the left of y. The constraints infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) mean z extends at least as far leftward as y and at least as far rightward as y.

So, depending on how far z extends to the left, x could either be to the left of z or overlap with z in the x-axis. But given that x is to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)), and y is at most as wide as z (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)), x cannot be to the right of z as there's no way supx(z) ≤ infx(x) given our constraints.

Specifically, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). To have x to the right of z, we'd need infx(x) ≥ supx(z). But with infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), we see that infx(y) might not be to the left of supx(z). In the edge case where infx(y) = infx(z) and supx(y) = supx(z), we'd have y and z with the same width. But then, we'd have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = infx(z) ≤ supx(z). This suggests that x is to the left of or might overlap with z, but certainly isn't to the right of z. So, x can't be E, NE, or SE of z.

Actually now I'm confused about my reasoning again. Let's do something concrete to make sure I'm accurate. I'll draw a sample grid with some positioned regions, and then I'll evaluate the cardinal directions.

Let's say the grid has coordinates (x, y).

Scenario 1, region y is at (5, 5) to (8, 8), then:
- For x to be SW of y, region x could be at (2, 2) to (4, 4).
- For y to be N of z, region z could be at (4, 1) to (9, 4).

With this positioning, we'd have: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4, infx(y) = 5, supx(y) = 8, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 8, infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 9, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 4.

Given these specific coordinates, let's check the relation between x and z:
- Is x SW of z? We'd need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We have: 4 ≤ 4 and 4 ≤ 1. This is false (the y-value comparison doesn't hold).
- Is x W of z? We'd need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We have: 4 ≤ 4, 1 ≤ 2, and 4 ≤ 4. This is true.
- Is x NW of z? We'd need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We have: 4 ≤ 4 and 4 ≤ 2. This is false (the y-value comparison doesn't hold).

So, in this particular scenario, x is W of z.

But I could adjust the positioning to get other relations. For example:
- If z is positioned at (2, 1) to (9, 4), then x would be B of z.
- If z is positioned at (6, 1) to (9, 4), then x would be SW of z.

Ah, I think I see the issue now. The positions of the regions are under-constrained, which allows for multiple possible relations between x and z. We're only given constraints for the relations between x and y, and between y and z. These don't fully determine the relation between x and z.

So, indeed, based on our constraints, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, NW, S, B, and N.

Actually wait, before I submit, let me make sure I'm being careful. Let's check each cardinal relation in turn and check whether it's possible or not.

For x SW z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z). If infx(z) < infx(y), then there's a gap where supx(x) ≤ infx(z) doesn't necessarily hold. But if infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = infx(z), and the x-value condition holds. For the y-value, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z). So, both x and z are below y, but their relative vertical positions can vary. So, x SW z is possible.

For x W z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). As discussed for SW, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible. For the y-value constraints, we don't have direct constraints between infy(x) and infy(z), or between supy(x) and supy(z). So, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can hold. Thus, x W z is possible.

For x NW z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The x-value condition, as discussed for SW, is possible. For the y-value, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y). But this doesn't directly constrain supy(z) relative to infy(x). So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible, making x NW z possible.

For x S z: We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z). If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y), then the x-value condition requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y). This is possible as long as infx(z) ≤ infx(x) holds. For the y-value, as with the other relations, we don't have a direct constraint between supy(x) and infy(z). So, x S z is possible.

For x B z: We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z). As discussed for S, the x-value conditions can hold. For the y-value, we don't have direct constraints between infy(x) and infy(z), or between supy(x) and supy(z). So, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can hold. Thus, x B z is possible.

For x N z: We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The x-value conditions, as discussed for S, can hold. For the y-value, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y). But this doesn't directly constrain supy(z) relative to infy(x). So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible, making x N z possible.

For x SE z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z). These constraints don't directly tell us if infx(x) > supx(z). But let's trace through the implications: If infx(x) > supx(z), then supx(x) > supx(z). We also know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z). So, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). But we're trying to show infx(x) > supx(z), which would mean supx(x) > supx(z). This is a contradiction. So, infx(x) > supx(z) can't hold, which means x SE z isn't possible.

For x E z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). As shown for SE, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) can't hold given our constraints. So, x E z isn't possible.

For x NE z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). As shown for SE, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) can't hold. So, x NE z isn't possible.

To conclude, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, NW, S, B, and N. The relations SE, E, and NE aren't possible.

But wait. Let me rethink about x being SE of z. For this, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

We know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

Let's see. From the above, we can derive: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then we'd have supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z). But a region can't have infx = supx, so this is a contradiction. So, x can't be to the right of z, meaning x can't be SE, E, or NE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, NW, S, B, and N.

Hmm, actually I think I got confused about the relation and made a mistake. Let's recheck.

We know:
- x is SW of y, meaning supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- y is N of z, meaning supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Given that x is SW of y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y). And given that y is N of z, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). So, x is to the left of or at most aligned with the right edge of z. This means x could be SW, W, NW, S, B, or N of z, but not SE, E, or NE.

Actually, I think I'd like to also double-check whether x can be SW of z.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

We know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z)

The constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(y) says x is to the left of y. The constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(y) says z extends at least as far to the left as y. If z extends exactly as far to the left as y (i.e., infx(z) = infx(y)), then we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. But if z extends further to the left than y (i.e., infx(z) < infx(y)), then we don't know if supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

Similarly, the constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(y) says x is below y. The constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(y) says z is below y. If z is positioned exactly at the bottom edge of y (i.e., supy(z) = infy(y)), then we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) = supy(z), which means x isn't below z. But if z is positioned lower than the bottom edge of y (i.e., supy(z) < infy(y)), then we can have x below z.

So, for x to be SW of z, we'd need infx(z) = infx(y) (z and y align on the left) and supy(z) < infy(y) (z is lower than y). This is a valid scenario, so x SW z is possible.

Actually, my bad again. I forgot that the relation SW requires a strict inequality for the x-coordinates. Let's reconsider.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

We know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z)

The conditions for SW actually don't specify if the inequality has to be strict. So let's go with the definition provided, which implies infx(z) is the greatest lower bound, not just an arbitrary point inside region z.

From the constraints, infx(z) ≤ infx(y). If infx(z) = infx(y), then we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. If infx(z) < infx(y), then it's possible that supx(x) ≥ infx(z), which would mean x overlaps with z in the x-axis. So, for x to be to the left of z, we'd need infx(z) = infx(y).

Now, for x to be below z, we'd need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y). If supy(z) = infy(y), then supy(x) ≤ infy(y) = supy(z), which means x is not below z. If supy(z) < infy(y), then infy(z) might be such that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would mean x is below z.

So, for x to be SW of z, we'd need infx(z) = infx(y) (z and y align on the left) and supy(z) < infy(y) (z is positioned lower than y's bottom edge). This is a valid scenario, so x SW z is possible.

Actually wait, I think I'm getting confused about the representation of the regions. Let's be clear. I know that at this point that infx, infy, supx, supy are the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region.

For a relation "a SW b" to be true, we need:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the left of b)
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (a is below b)

It's unlikely that supy(z) = infy(y), since these are bounds and y is N of z. So, supy(z) < infy(y). Given this, it's possible to have infy(z) such that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would mean x is below z. But I've also shown that for x to be to the left of z, we'd need infx(z) = infx(y) (z and y align on the left). But then again, it's unlikely that infx(z) = infx(y), since these are bounds and y is N of z. More plausibly, infx(z) < infx(y). But then, we couldn't guarantee supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x might not be to the left of z.

But wait, the relation "y N z" only requires that:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far to the left as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far to the right as y)

It doesn't restrict how far z can extend to the left or right. So, it's possible that z extends just as far to the left as y (infx(z) = infx(y)), or that z extends much further to the left (infx(z) << infx(y)).

Given this, it's possible to have a scenario where infx(z) = infx(y). In such a case, we'd have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. And since supy(z) < infy(y), it's possible to have infy(z) such that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would mean x is below z.

But it's also possible that infx(z) < supx(x) < infx(y), which means x would overlap with z in the x-axis, and we'd get S, B, or N, depending on the vertical alignment.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's just check if each cardinal relation is possible, and confirm the logic with a visual example.

For x SW z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Visual example:
```
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 
1                 +------+
2                 |  y   |
3                 +------+
4                   
5                   
6 +---+          +------+
7 | x |          |  z   |
8 +---+          +------+
```

Here, infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 8, infx(y) = 5, supx(y) = 7, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 3, infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 8, infy(z) = 6, supy(z) = 8.

We can verify: supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(z) = 5 and supy(x) = 8 ≤ infy(z) = 6 (oops, this is not true). So, x isn't SW of z in this example as I've messed up the construction.

Let's try a different example:
```
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 
1                 +------+
2                 |  y   |
3                 +------+
4                   
5                   
6 +---+          +------+
7 | x |          |      |
8 +---+          |  z   |
9                 |      |
10                +------+
```

Here, infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 8, infx(y) = 5, supx(y) = 7, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 3, infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 8, infy(z) = 6, supy(z) = 10.

Now, we have: supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(z) = 5 and supy(x) = 8 ≤ infy(z) = 6 (this is still not true).

I think I'm consistently messing up the y-coordinates. Let's try again with a clear understanding. The y-coordinates increase as we go downward in our ASCII representation, but infy and supy should increase as we go upward in the 2D Cartesian plane.

So let's try again:
```
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 
10 +---+          +------+
9  | x |          |  y   |
8  +---+          +------+
7                   
6                   
5                 +------+
4                 |      |
3                 |  z   |
2                 |      |
1                 +------+
```

Oh, I'm still doing it backwards. I should have y at the top, z below it, and x to the southwest.

```
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 
10                +------+
9                 |  y   |
8                 +------+
7                   
6                   
5                 +------+
4                 |      |
3                 |  z   |
2                 |      |
1 +---+          +------+
```

Wait no, that's still bad. OK let's try to use a more direct approach rather than drawing it out.

Let's make a scenario for x SW z:
- x: (1, 1) to (3, 3)
- y: (5, 5) to (7, 7)
- z: (5, 1) to (7, 3)

Here, x is SW of y: supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 5 and supy(x) = 3 ≤ infy(y) = 5.
And y is N of z: supy(z) = 3 ≤ infy(y) = 5, infx(z) = 5 ≤ infx(y) = 5, and supx(y) = 7 ≤ supx(z) = 7.
And x is SW of z: supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(z) = 5 and supy(x) = 3 ≤ infy(z) = 1.

Wait, this isn't right. If infy(z) = 1, then supy(x) = 3 > infy(z) = 1, so x isn't below z, which means x isn't SW of z. Let me rethink this.

Let's try again:
- x: (1, 1) to (3, 3)
- y: (5, 8) to (7, 10)
- z: (5, 4) to (7, 6)

Here, x is SW of y: supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 5 and supy(x) = 3 ≤ infy(y) = 8.
And y is N of z: supy(z) = 6 ≤ infy(y) = 8, infx(z) = 5 ≤ infx(y) = 5, and supx(y) = 7 ≤ supx(z) = 7.
And x is SW of z? supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(z) = 5, but supy(x) = 3 ≤ infy(z) = 4 doesn't hold. So, x isn't SW of z in this scenario.

OK this is hard to construct on the fly. Let's just think very concretely about what the relation "x SW z" would mean in terms of our constraints.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

For x to be to the left of z, we'd need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z). Thus, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). It doesn't necessarily follow that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But if we consider a scenario where infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. But if infx(z) < infx(y), then we'd need to ensure supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which isn't guaranteed by our constraints.

For x to be below z, we'd need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z). But we don't have a direct constraint between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible to have infy(z) > supy(x), which would mean x is below z. But it's also possible to have infy(z) ≤ supy(x), which would mean x overlaps with or is above z in the y-axis.

So, for x to be SW of z, we'd need:
1. infx(z) ≥ supx(x) (which is possible if infx(z) = infx(y), though not guaranteed if infx(z) < infx(y))
2. infy(z) ≥ supy(x) (which is a valid scenario, but not guaranteed by our constraints)

So, x SW z is a possible relation, but it's not the only possible relation.

Similarly, we can check if x can be W of z, NW of z, S of z, B of z, N of z, SE of z, E of z, or NE of z.

So x SW z is definitely possible. Using similar reasoning we can check all of the possible cardinal directions. I've done this at length and determined that the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, NW, S, B, and N. The relations SE, E, and NE aren't possible because of the constraint that x is to the left of y.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, NW, S, B, and N.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the SW relation:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is completely to the south of y)

From the N relation:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is completely to the south of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

Analyzing the constraints:
1. We know x is west of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))
2. We know z extends at least as far west as y (infx(z) ≤ infx(y))
3. Given these constraints, x can never be east of z because x's eastern edge is west of y's western edge, while z extends at least as far east as y

Looking at vertical positioning:
- Both x and z are south of y, but their relative positions to each other aren't fully constrained

The possible relations are:
SW, W, NW, S, B, N
