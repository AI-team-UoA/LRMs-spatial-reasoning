PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

In this question, we're given two cardinal direction relations:
1. x is SE of y
2. y is W of z

And we need to find all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Let's think about what these directions mean:
- x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's analyze what this tells us about the relationship between x and z:

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom is above or aligned with z's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is below or aligned with z's top)

Combining these:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
  This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z).

- supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
  This means supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z), so x is south of z.

So we know that x is south of z, but we don't have a direct constraint on the east-west relationship between x and z.

Let's consider different possibilities:

Case 1: If infx(x) < infx(z), then x extends more to the west than z does. 
Combined with the fact that x is south of z, x could be SW of z.

Case 2: If infx(x) = infx(z), then x and z are aligned on the west side. 
Combined with the fact that x is south of z, x could be S of z.

Case 3: If infx(x) > infx(z) and supx(x) < supx(z), then x is east of z's west bound but west of z's east bound.
Combined with the fact that x is south of z, x could be S of z.

Case 4: If infx(x) > infx(z) and supx(x) = supx(z), then x and z are aligned on the east side, but x is more to the east on the west side.
Combined with the fact that x is south of z, x could be S of z.

Case 5: If infx(x) > infx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z), then x extends more to the east than z does.
Combined with the fact that x is south of z, x could be SE of z.

Case 6: If infx(x) = supx(z), then x is just to the east of z (they touch).
Combined with the fact that x is south of z, x could be SE of z.

Case 7: If infx(x) > supx(z), then x is entirely to the east of z.
Combined with the fact that x is south of z, x could be SE of z.

Actually, let's think more directly. From the constraints:

- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)

So both x and z are to the east of y, but we don't know their direct east-west relationship. 

- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom is above or aligned with z's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is below or aligned with z's top)

I realize I have made a mistake previously. Let's reconsider. Here's what we know:

- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is below or aligned with y's bottom)

This doesn't directly tell us the north-south relationship between x and z. We know that x is south of y, and z's bottom could be below y's bottom. So x could be south of z, but it could also overlap with z in the north-south direction.

Let's consider different possibilities:

1. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is entirely south of z, giving the relations S, SW, or SE.
2. If supy(x) > infy(z) and infy(x) < supy(z), then x and z overlap in the north-south direction, giving the relations W, B, or E.
3. If infy(x) >= supy(z), then x is entirely north of z, giving the relations N, NW, or NE. 
   But I think this case isn't possible, because we know that x is south of y (supy(x) <= infy(y)), and z is south of y or at the same height (infy(z) <= infy(y)). It would be a contradiction for x to be entirely north of z.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicated this. Let's re-do by considering the possible positions of region z relative to the other regions.

If x is SE of y, and y is W of z, we have:
- x is to the east and south of y
- y is to the west of z, with some vertical alignment (y is within the north-south bounds of z)

Given the cardinal directions:
- x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's draw a picture schematically as a 3x3 grid that shows the possible positions of regions:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | B | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

Relative to y, x is in the SE position. Relative to z, y is in the W position. So if we place y in the center (B), then x is in the SE position of the grid, and z is in the E position of the grid.

Now, if we place z in the center (B), then y is in the W position. And if y is in the W position, then x is in the SW position of z.

Wait, we need to be a bit careful here. Let's think of this in terms of the reference frame.

If x is SE of y, then in y's reference frame, x is in the SE tile. And if y is W of z, then in z's reference frame, y is in the W tile.

From this, we must determine the possible positions of x in z's reference frame. Given the constraints, x could be in the SW, S, or SE tile of z, or possibly the W, B, or E tile. Let's double-check this by analyzing the constraints more rigorously.

From x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y W z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is below or aligned with y's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is below or aligned with z's top)

Now let's infer the constraints on the relationship between x and z:

- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z)

This doesn't directly constrain the relationship between x and z in the east-west direction. 

- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z)

Combining these, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z)

This means that supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies that x is to the south of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- S (if x and z have the same east-west bounds)
- SW (if x is to the west of z)
- SE (if x is to the east of z)

Actually I realize I misread the condition for one tile to be south of another. The condition for a S b is: supy(a) <= infy(b) and infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). It's not just about vertical alignment; it's also about a being within the horizontal bounds of b.

Given all the constraints and the possible positions of y, z, and x, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

We have:
- x is SE of y, which means x is to the east and south of y
- y is W of z, which means y is to the west of z with some vertical overlap

From these, we infer:
- x is to the east of y
- y is to the west of z
- Since y is to the west of z, and x is to the east of y, x could be to the west, aligned, or to the east of z in the east-west direction

- x is to the south of y
- y has some vertical overlap with z (it's within the north-south bounds of z)
- Given the above, x could be to the south of z, or it could have some vertical overlap with z

Combining all of these, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- SW (if x is to the west of z and south of z)
- S (if x is within the east-west bounds of z and south of z)
- SE (if x is to the east of z and south of z)
- W (if x is to the west of z and has some vertical overlap with z)
- B (if x is within the east-west bounds of z and has some vertical overlap with z)
- E (if x is to the east of z and has some vertical overlap with z)

Actually I need to be more precise. Let's really examine the constraints in detail.

First, let's identify the constraints we have:
1. x SE y: This means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y W z: This means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive constraints on the relationship between x and z:

East-West Relationship:
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z)

These don't directly constrain the east-west relationship between x and z. x could be to the west, aligned, or to the east of z.

North-South Relationship:
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining the second and third constraints: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
This means z could vertically contain y, or they could partially overlap.

Now, combining the first constraint with either of the above: supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
This gives us: supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).

Without any direct constraints on the relationship between infy(z) and supy(x), we can have:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z): x is entirely south of z
2. infy(z) <= supy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(z): x and z vertically overlap
3. supy(z) <= infy(x): x is entirely north of z

Wait, is the third case possible? We know supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z). This implies supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). So, we have supy(x) <= supy(z). And for x to be entirely north of z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), which would give us supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction because a region's bottom (infy) cannot be above its top (supy). So, the third case isn't possible.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this again. Let's approach it more directly.

Given the constraints:
- x is SE of y
- y is W of z

From these, we can deduce:
- x is to the southeast of y
- y is to the west of z, with some vertical overlap (y is within the north-south bounds of z)

Graphically, if we place y at the center, then x is to the southeast of y, and z is to the east of y. This still doesn't firmly establish the relation between x and z, as x could be to the southwest, south, or southeast of z, or even have some vertical overlap with z and be west, bounding-box-contained, or east of it.

Now, let's infer what the constraints tell us about the relationship between x and z:

1. East-West Relationship: x is east of y, and y is west of z. Without more constraints, x could be west, aligned, or east of z.

2. North-South Relationship: x is south of y, and y is vertically within the bounds of z (meaning y and z have some vertical overlap). From this, x must be south of a portion of z (specifically, the part that overlaps with y). Depending on the exact positions, x could be entirely south of z, or x could vertically overlap with the southern part of z.

Given the above, the potential relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)
- W (if x is west of z and vertically overlaps with z)
- B (if x is horizontally aligned with z and vertically overlaps with z)
- E (if x is east of z and vertically overlaps with z)


Wait, I feel that I'm still not getting the answer right. Let's really try to be precise, and examine all potential constraints. Let's use the properties of the relationships.

For any two regions a and b:
- a SE b means: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a W b means: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)


Given:
- x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

East-West Inferences:
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z)

From this, both x and z are to the east of y, but their relative east-west relationship is not directly constrained.

North-South Inferences:
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means that supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
Combining, we get: supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).

I see where my confusion is. The constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) means that z's bottom bound is below or at the same level as y's bottom bound, and not necessarily that z extends below y. This, coupled with supy(y) <= supy(z), means that y is vertically within the bounds of z or touches it at the bottom or top.

From supy(x) <= infy(y), we know that x is below y. And from infy(z) <= infy(y), we know that z extends at least as low as y does. This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z in the north-south direction. x could be entirely below z, or x could overlap with the lower part of z.

Okay, I've been going back and forth on this, but I think I've been overlooking a simpler way to approach this. Let's think of it in terms of the relative positions of the three regions, and see what the constraints allow.

Given the constraints:
- x is SE of y: This means x is to the southeast of y.
- y is W of z: This means y is to the west of z, with y vertically contained within z or touching z at the top or bottom.

From a bird's eye view, if we place y at the origin, then x is to the southeast, and z is to the east (with some vertical overlap with y).

Let's consider the potential positions of x:

1. If x is entirely to the east of z, then it is E, NE, or SE of z, depending on its vertical relationship with z.
2. If x overlaps horizontally with z, then it is N, B, or S of z, depending on its vertical relationship with z.
3. If x is entirely to the west of z, then it is W, NW, or SW of z, depending on its vertical relationship with z.

Now, considering the vertical relationship:

1. If x is entirely above z, then it is N, NW, or NE of z, depending on its horizontal relationship with z.
2. If x overlaps vertically with z, then it is W, B, or E of z, depending on its horizontal relationship with z.
3. If x is entirely below z, then it is S, SW, or SE of z, depending on its horizontal relationship with z.

I have been assuming that x SE y doesn't tell us that x is entirely to the south of y, just that x's northernmost extent is at or below y's southernmost extent. Let's see what the definition says:

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

According to this, for x SE y, it means that the leftmost (west) point of x is to the right (east) of the rightmost (east) point of y, AND the highest (north) point of x is below (south) or at the same level as the lowest (south) point of y. In other words, x is entirely to the east of y and entirely to the south of y.

Similar for y W z:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For y W z, it means that the rightmost (east) point of y is to the left (west) of the leftmost (west) point of z, AND the lowest (south) point of z is below (south) or at the same level as the lowest (south) point of y, AND the highest (north) point of y is below (north) or at the same level as the highest (north) point of z. In other words, y is entirely to the west of z, and vertically, y is either contained within the bounds of z or touches z at the top or bottom.

Okay, with these clarifications, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

From x SE y, we know that x is entirely to the east of y and entirely to the south of y.
From y W z, we know that y is entirely to the west of z, and vertically, y is either contained within the bounds of z or touches z at the top or bottom.

Now, we infer the relationship between x and z:

1. Horizontal relationship: x is entirely to the east of y, and y is entirely to the west of z. Without more constraints, x could be west, aligned, or east of z.

2. Vertical relationship: x is entirely to the south of y, and y is vertically contained within z or touches z at the top or bottom. This means that x is somewhere to the south of y, and y is somewhere within the vertical bounds of z. Given the SE relationship, x must be entirely south of y, which is within or at the boundary of z. This suggests that x is below or at the southern boundary of z.

Given the above, the potential relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)

Actually, I'm uncertain if I'm interpreting the vertical constraints correctly in the W relationship. Let's make sure:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For y W z, this means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y is entirely to the west of z
- infy(z) <= infy(y): The bottom (south) of z is at or below the bottom (south) of y
- supy(y) <= supy(z): The top (north) of y is at or below the top (north) of z

The constraints infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) mean that vertically, y is within the bounds of z or touches z at the top or bottom.

Now, from x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is entirely to the east of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is entirely to the south of y

Combining the vertical constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z)

This means: supy(x) <= infy(y) >= infy(z)

From this, we can't make a direct inference about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). x could be entirely south of z (if supy(x) <= infy(z)), or x could have vertical overlap with the southern part of z (if infy(z) < supy(x)).

I think I've been unnecessarily complicating things. Let me take a step back and visualize this.

Given:
- x is SE of y: x is to the east and south of y
- y is W of z: y is to the west of z, with some vertical overlap

If I place y at the origin, then x is to the southeast of y, and z is to the east of y. The constraint on the vertical relationship between y and z means that y has vertical overlap with z. But the fact that x is to the south of y doesn't directly constrain the vertical relationship between x and z, because z's vertical extent isn't fully determined (it just has some overlap with y).

The most straightforward way to illustrate all possible relationships is to consider all possible relative positions of z. Remember that z is:
- east of y
- has some vertical overlap with y

Given all the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)
- W (if x is west of z and vertically overlaps with z)
- B (if x is horizontally aligned with z and vertically overlaps with z)
- E (if x is east of z and vertically overlaps with z)

Hmm, but this still doesn't feel right. Let me analyze the constraints from the beginning, step-by-step:

Given:
1. x SE y: This means x is entirely to the east of y and entirely to the south of y.
2. y W z: This means y is entirely to the west of z, and vertically, y has some overlap with z.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to analyze the horizontal and vertical relationships:

East-West Relationship:
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
- From y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is west of z)

This means both x and z are to the east of y, but we don't know their relative east-west positions. x could be west, aligned, or east of z.

North-South Relationship:
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is south of y)
- From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically contained within z or at its boundary)

The constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) means that z extends as low as, or lower than, y. And supy(y) <= supy(z) means that z extends as high as, or higher than, y. Together, they mean that z contains y in the north-south direction (or touches it at one or both ends).

Now, since x is south of y, and y is vertically contained within z, x could be south of z, or it could vertically overlap with the southern part of z.

Given the above analysis, the potential relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)
- W (if x is west of z and vertically overlaps with z)
- B (if x is horizontally aligned with z and vertically overlaps with z)
- E (if x is east of z and vertically overlaps with z)

Actually, let's try to visualize this even further. Let's consider a specific arrangement of y and z, and then determine the possible positions of x.

Let's say y is a square, and z is a rectangle that's to the east of y and vertically contains y. Now, x is to the southeast of y. Given this, x could be in any of the following positions:
1. Entirely to the east of z (making x E, SE, or NE of z)
2. Partially overlapping with z in the east-west direction (making x N, B, or S of z)
3. Entirely to the west of z but still east of y (making x W, NW, or SW of z)

Given that x is south of y, and y is vertically contained within z, x's vertical relationship with z could be:
1. Entirely south of z (making x SW, S, or SE of z)
2. Vertically overlapping with the southern part of z (making x W, B, or E of z)

Combining these, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)
- W (if x is west of z and vertically overlaps with z)
- B (if x is horizontally aligned with z and vertically overlaps with z)
- E (if x is east of z and vertically overlaps with z)

Let me review my understanding once more. 

Given:
1. x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y is W of z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let me analyze the constraints more carefully:

East-West Relationship:
- From x SE y and y W z, we have:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x)
  - supx(y) <= infx(z)
  This doesn't directly constrain the east-west relationship between x and z. So, x could be west, aligned, or east of z.

North-South Relationship:
- The constraints are:
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
  - infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z)
  - supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z)

From this, we know that:
- x is south of y
- z's bottom (infy(z)) is below or at the same level as y's bottom (infy(y))
- y's top (supy(y)) is below or at the same level as z's top (supy(z))

The constraints supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) still don't give us a direct constraint on the relationship between x and z in the north-south direction. However, z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom, and y's bottom is above or at the same level as x's top. This suggests that z could overlap with x in the north-south direction, or z could be entirely north of x.

Given this understanding, the potential relationships between x and z are:
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- E (if x is east of z and vertically overlaps with z)
- B (if x is horizontally aligned with z and vertically overlaps with z)
- W (if x is west of z and vertically overlaps with z)

But actually I'm still not sure if W, B, and E are possible. Let's see if I can prove or disprove them.

If x W z is a potential relation, it means:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (z's bottom is below or at the same level as x's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is below or at the same level as z's top)

Given that x SE y and y W z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is below or at the same level as z's top)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is south of y)

For x W z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). This is possible because we know x is east of y and y is west of z, but there's no constraint that directly relates x's east bound to z's west bound.

For x W z, we also need infy(z) <= infy(x) (z's bottom is below or at the same level as x's bottom). We know that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y). Thus, we have:
infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)

This means: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y). But we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), or between infy(z) and supy(x). For x to be south of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z), but the constraints we have don't enforce this.

Ah, now I see the issue: I was conflating the constraints for W and other directions. If W, B, or E are possible, it means x has some vertical overlap with z. For x to have a vertical overlap with z, we'd need:
- infy(x) < supy(z)
- infy(z) < supy(x)

We don't have direct constraints that guarantee these, but we have:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)

This suggests that z's bottom (infy(z)) is potentially below y's bottom (infy(y)), and x's top (supy(x)) is below y's bottom. This could mean:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
  
To paraphrase: z's bottom is below (or at the same level as) y's bottom, and x's top is below (or at the same level as) y's bottom. This can be rearranged as:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)

Now, it's possible that infy(z) < supy(x) (for vertical overlap), but it's also possible that supy(x) < infy(z) (for no vertical overlap).

Wait, let me visualize this better. Let's consider a specific example (just for illustration, not a formal proof):

Region y is at coordinates (2, 2) to (4, 4).
Region z is at coordinates (5, 1) to (7, 5).
Region x could be at coordinates:
- Example 1: (5, 0) to (7, 1). This would make x S of z.
- Example 2: (8, 0) to (10, 1). This would make x SE of z.
- Example 3: (3, 0) to (4, 1). This would make x SW of z.
- Example 4: (5, 0.5) to (7, 1.5). This would make x B of z.
- Example 5: (8, 0.5) to (10, 1.5). This would make x E of z.
- Example 6: (3, 0.5) to (4, 1.5). This would make x W of z.

Yes, all six relationships seem possible.

Actually let me reconsider the constraints for x SE y and y W z:

- x SE y:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is south of y)

- y W z:
  - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is west of z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom)
  - supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is below or at the same level as z's top)

Now, the one constraint I'm most unsure about is the interpretation of infy(z) <= infy(y). This means z's bottom (south) is at or below y's bottom (south).

For W, B, and E relationships:
- For x W z, we need vertical overlap between x and z.
- For x B z, we need vertical overlap between x and z.
- For x E z, we need vertical overlap between x and z.

From the constraints, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is south of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is at or below y's bottom)

This means:
supy(x) <= infy(y) && infy(z) <= infy(y)

For vertical overlap between x and z, we'd need:
- infy(x) < supy(z)
- infy(z) < supy(x)

Given the constraint that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y), it's possible that infy(z) < supy(x), which would allow for vertical overlap between x and z.

Actually, hold on. Given the constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is south of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is at or below y's bottom)

We have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)

For x and z to vertically overlap, we'd need:
- infy(x) < supy(z) (x starts before z ends)
- infy(z) < supy(x) (z starts before x ends)

From the constraints, we know supy(x) <= infy(y). And from the implications of y W z, we know that z contains y in the north-south direction, which means supy(z) >= supy(y) (not just supy(y) <= supy(z), but z actually extends above y). Hence, infy(x) < supy(z) is possible.

Now, for infy(z) < supy(x), we need to examine the constraints. We have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y). It's possible that infy(z) < supy(x) if infy(z) < infy(y). But if infy(z) = infy(y), then we'd have supy(x) <= infy(y) = infy(z), which would mean x is entirely below z, not overlapping. We have to check both scenarios.

I think I've been over-analyzing again. Let me take a step back and re-visualize this.

Given:
- x is SE of y: x is to the east and south of y
- y is W of z: y is to the west of z and vertically contained or aligned with z

From these, we infer:
- x is to the east of y and south of y
- z is to the east of y and vertically contains or aligns with y

Now, we need to find the potential relations between x and z. x is to the east of y, and z is to the east of y. Without more constraints, x could be west, aligned, or east of z in the east-west direction. x is to the south of y, and z vertically contains or aligns with y. Without more constraints, x could be entirely south of z, or x could have vertical overlap with the southern part of z.

Given the above, the potential relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)
- W (if x is west of z and vertically overlaps with z)
- B (if x is horizontally aligned with z and vertically overlaps with z)
- E (if x is east of z and vertically overlaps with z)

To be more rigorous, let's analyze if there's any constraint I might be overlooking. We have:

- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is south of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is at or below y's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is at or below z's top)

From this, we've established that x is east of y and south of y, and z is east of y and contains or aligns with y in the north-south direction. Looking at the list of constraints, there's nothing that restricts the east-west or north-south relationship between x and z beyond what we've already deduced.

I'm now confident in the potential relations between x and z:
- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)
- W (if x is west of z and vertically overlaps with z)
- B (if x is horizontally aligned with z and vertically overlaps with z)
- E (if x is east of z and vertically overlaps with z)

Actually, wait. if infy(z) = infy(y), then from the given constraints, we'd have supy(x) <= infy(y) = infy(z), which would imply that x is strictly south of z. But what if infy(z) < infy(y)? In this case, z's bottom extends below y's bottom. From the constraint supy(x) <= infy(y), x's top is at or below y's bottom. Z's bottom extends below y's bottom, but we doesn't directly constrain the relationship between x's top and z's bottom. If infy(z) < supy(x), then x and z would vertically overlap. Conversely, if supy(x) <= infy(z), then x would be entirely south of z.

I think I make an error somewhere. Let me recheck the constraints:

- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is south of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is at or below y's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is at or below z's top)

I think I just realized the issue: infy(z) <= infy(y) doesn't imply that z's bottom can extend below y's bottom; it means the opposite. It means y's bottom is at or below z's bottom.

Ah, I see the confusion. Let me revisit the definition:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For y W z, this means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is at or below y's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is at or below z's top)

So, infy(z) <= infy(y) means that z's bottom is at or below y's bottom. And supy(y) <= supy(z) means that y's top is at or below z's top. Together, in the north-south direction, z either contains y or touches it at one or both ends.

Now, if infy(z) is strictly less than infy(y), then z's bottom extends below y's bottom. In this case, we can't directly infer the relationship between z's bottom and x's top. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is entirely south of z. But if infy(z) < supy(x) < infy(y), then x and z vertically overlap.

If infy(z) = infy(y), then from the constraints, we'd have supy(x) <= infy(y) = infy(z), which would imply that x is completely south of z.

So in summary, x could be completely south of z (resulting in relations SW, S, SE), or x's top could extend above z's bottom, indicating a vertical overlap (leading to relations W, B, E).

Given the above, the potential relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)
- W (if x is west of z and vertically overlaps with z)
- B (if x is horizontally aligned with z and vertically overlaps with z)
- E (if x is east of z and vertically overlaps with z)

Actually, I just read my analysis again and I made the same error again. infy(z) <= infy(y) means that z's bottom is at or below y's bottom, or, equivalently, that y's bottom is at or above z's bottom. So, z's bottom can be below y's bottom, but not the other way around.

Given the constraints again:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is south of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is at or below y's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is at or below z's top)

We know:
- y's bottom (infy(y)) is at or above z's bottom (infy(z)), which means z can extend below y.
- y's top (supy(y)) is at or below z's top (supy(z)), which means z can extend above y.
- x's top (supy(x)) is at or below y's bottom (infy(y)), which means x is south of y.

Let me visualize the relationship between the regions clearly:
Vertically, we have (from top to bottom):
z's top (possibly)
y's top
...
y's bottom
x's top
...
x's bottom
z's bottom (possibly)

This visualization captures the constraints:
- y's top is at or below z's top.
- y's bottom is at or above z's bottom.
- x's top is at or below y's bottom.

From this, if z's bottom is below y's bottom, then x and z could vertically overlap. Conversely, if z's bottom is at the same level as y's bottom, then x is entirely south of z.

Given the above, the potential relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)
- W (if x is west of z and vertically overlaps with z)
- B (if x is horizontally aligned with z and vertically overlaps with z)
- E (if x is east of z and vertically overlaps with z)

So, in the end, we have six possible cardinal direction relationships between region x and region z given the constraints: SW, S, SE, W, B, and E.

Actually, now that I'm writing them all out at once, let me actually double check:

- SW (if x is west of z and entirely south of z)
- S (if x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely south of z)
- SE (if x is east of z and entirely south of z)
- W (if x is west of z and vertically overlaps with z)
- B (if x is horizontally aligned with z and vertically overlaps with z)
- E (if x is east of z and vertically overlaps with z)

Hmm, nothing looks wrong. Let's make sure we've checked all possible cardinal directions:
N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B

we've derived:
SW, S, SE, W, B, E

So we are missing N, NE, and NW. Let's check them individually:

N: x is north of z.
   This would require x to be entirely above z, which isn't possible because we know x is south of y, and y is vertically contained within or aligned with z.

NE: x is to the northeast of z.
    This would require x to be east of z and north of z, which isn't possible for the same reason as above.

NW: x is to the northwest of z.
    This would require x to be west of z and north of z, which isn't possible for the same reason as above.

So, the only possible cardinal direction relationships between region x and region z given the constraints are: SW, S, SE, W, B, and E.

But actually, I realized I may be overlooking the case where x and z touch. But I believe the cardinal direction relationships I've derived already capture the touch scenarios implicitly. For example, if x is at the southern border of z, it's still considered S of z. If x is at the western border of z and also at the southern border of z, it's still considered SW of z, and so on.

Let me actually double check if we've missed any. The fact that x is southeast to y and y is west to z constrains x to be east of y and south of y. Also, z is east of y and vertically contains or aligns with y.

East-west wise, x and z could be arranged in three ways: x west of z, x aligned with z, or x east of z.
North-south wise, x and z could be arranged in two ways: x entirely south of z, or x overlapping with z vertically.

This gives us six distinct possibilities, which I've listed: SW, S, SE, W, B, E.

Okay, I believe we've exhausted all possible cardinal direction relationships between x and z. The possible relations are:
SW, S, SE, W, B, E.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, SE, W, B, E.

To determine this, I analyzed the constraints:

For x SE y:
- x is east of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x))
- x is south of y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y))

For y W z:
- y is west of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z))
- z's bottom is at or below y's bottom (infy(z) ≤ infy(y))
- y's top is at or below z's top (supy(y) ≤ supy(z))

From these constraints:
1. East-west relationship: x is east of y, and z is east of y. This means x could be west of z, aligned with z, or east of z.
2. North-south relationship: x is south of y, and z vertically contains or aligns with y. This means x could be entirely south of z, or x could vertically overlap with z.

Combining these possible arrangements gives us the six possible relations: SW, S, SE, W, B, E.
