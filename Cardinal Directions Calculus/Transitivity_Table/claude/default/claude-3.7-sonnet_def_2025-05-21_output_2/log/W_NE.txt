PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step:

First, I'll recall what we know:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

I need to figure out the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given that x is W of y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within y's y-range)

Given that y is NE of z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, I need to determine what these constraints tell me about the relationship between x and z.

From x being W of y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
From y being NE of z, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

However, this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). Either supx(x) ≤ supx(z) or supx(z) ≤ supx(x) could be true.

Similarly for the y-coordinates:
From x being W of y, we know infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
From y being NE of z, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Combining these, we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

This tells us that x is above z, which corresponds to the N (North) direction.

But we still don't know the east-west relationship precisely. Let's consider the possibilities:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z (W).
2. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x overlaps with z in the x-direction.
3. If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is to the east of z (E).

Given the initial constraints, options 1 and 2 are both possible, but option 3 is contradictory to our constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- NW (if x is to the west of z and above z)
- N (if x overlaps with z in the x-direction and is above z)

Let me double-check by thinking about the problem geometrically:

If y is NE of z, then z is SW of y.
If x is W of y, then x is to the west of y, with some overlap in the y-direction.

In this configuration, it's possible for x to be directly west of z, northwest of z, or even north of z, depending on exactly how x, y, and z are positioned.

Actually, there's another possibility I missed. If we consider the bounding boxes and the overlap conditions more carefully:

From x being W of y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y being NE of z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Actually, let me re-think this. Let's draw out the constraints and consider all possibilities:

For x W of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For y NE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, combining these constraints, we get:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- We can't directly compare supx(x) and supx(z) from these constraints.

So, we know that x is above z (because supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

For the east-west relationship:
- From x W of y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
- From y NE of z, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

Now, we have both supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). Comparing supx(x) and supx(z) directly:
- If supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x ends to the west of (or at the same point as) where z ends. This is consistent with x being W, NW, or SW of z.
- If supx(z) < supx(x), then z ends to the west of where x ends. This is consistent with x being N, NE, or E of z.

But, we also need to consider the starting points (infx) of x and z:
- If infx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x starts to the west of (or at the same point as) where z starts. This is consistent with x being W, NW, or N of z.
- If infx(z) < infx(x), then z starts to the west of where x starts. This is consistent with x being NE, E, or SE of z.

Combining the y-direction constraint (x is above z) with these x-direction considerations, the possible relations are:
- NW (if x is entirely to the west of z and above z)
- N (if x overlaps with z in the x-direction and is above z)
- NE (if x is entirely to the east of z and above z)

Wait, let's think about this more carefully.

For x W of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For y NE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, combining these constraints:
1. From the first two constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). But we can't directly compare supx(x) and supx(z) from these.
2. From the y-direction constraints, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x). This means x is above z.

Just to be sure, let's explore the possible scenarios in the x-direction:

- Scenario 1: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the west of z). The relation would be NW.
- Scenario 2: infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x partially overlaps with z in the x-direction). The relation would be N.
- Scenario 3: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x) (x partially overlaps with z in the x-direction). The relation would be N.
- Scenario 4: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is completely to the east of z). The relation would be NE.

But are all these scenarios consistent with the constraints?

From x being W of y and y being NE of z, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

From these, we can derive:
- max(supx(x), supx(z)) ≤ infx(y)

But this doesn't directly give us a relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). Both could be less than infx(y).

Let me try to visualize the most restrictive scenarios and see what's possible.

Scenario 1: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
For this to be true, we'd have: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
This is consistent with our constraints. So, x could be NW of z.

Scenario 2: infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
For this to be true, we'd have: infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
This is also consistent with our constraints. So, x could be N of z.

Scenario 3: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x)
For this to be true, we'd have: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
This is also consistent with our constraints. So, x could be N of z.

Scenario 4: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
For this to be true, we'd have: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
This is also consistent with our constraints. So, x could be NE of z.

Let's also consider the additional scenarios:

Scenario 5: infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
This gives us: infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
This is consistent with our constraints. So, x could be N of z.

Scenario 6: infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x)
This gives us: infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
This is consistent with our constraints. So, x could be N of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW
- N
- NE

But I need to check one more thing. For region x to be N of region z, I need to verify that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Let's see if this is consistent with our constraints.

From x W of y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y). And from y NE of z, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

So, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't give us a direct comparison between supx(x) and supx(z).

Let's again think about what the definitions of the relations tell us:

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within z's x-range)

From our constraints, we know:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so x is indeed above z.
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but we can't directly compare infx(x) with infx(z) or supx(x) with supx(z).

Actually, I'm simplifying the definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

Let's recall those:

- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

Now, let's use these definitions properly:

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For x NE z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

For x NW z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

From our constraints:
- We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't give us a direct comparison between supx(x) and supx(z) or between supx(x) and infx(z).

So, all three directions (N, NE, NW) are still possible.

However, let me think about the specific constraints more carefully.

From "x is W of y", we know that x is entirely to the west of y. This means the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y.

From "y is NE of z", we know that y is entirely to the northeast of z. This means y is both to the north and to the east of z. In particular, the leftmost point of y is to the right of the rightmost point of z.

Combining these two constraints, we can deduce that the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y, which is to the right of the rightmost point of z. In other words, the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z.

But this doesn't tell us directly how the leftmost points of x and z compare. So, we still have several possibilities:

Let's denote the x-coordinates of the leftmost and rightmost points of region x as x_left and x_right, respectively. Similarly for y and z.

From "x is W of y", we know:
x_right ≤ y_left

From "y is NE of z", we know:
z_right ≤ y_left
z_top ≤ y_bottom (where "top" refers to the y-coordinate of the topmost point and "bottom" refers to the y-coordinate of the bottommost point)

Combining these:
max(x_right, z_right) ≤ y_left

But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between x_right and z_right. Similarly, we can't directly compare x_left with z_left.

However, from "y is NE of z", we also know that y is above z. And from "x is W of y", we know that x overlaps with y in the y-direction. Considering the constraints on the y-coordinates, we can determine that x is either completely above z or partially overlaps with z in the y-direction.

OK, let's be thorough here, because this is getting more complex than I originally thought. Let me re-consider the definitions of the cardinal directions.

For x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

This means x is entirely to the left of y, and x overlaps with y in the y-direction.

For y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

This means y is entirely to the right of z, and y is entirely above z.

Now, combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From the first point, we don't get a direct comparison between supx(x) and supx(z). But from the second point, we can deduce supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is entirely above z.

Given that x is entirely above z, the possible relations are N, NE, or NW, depending on the x-coordinates. Let's examine each:

For x N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

We have two possible scenarios in terms of the x-coordinates that I previously considered:
1. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within z's x-range)
2. infx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supx(z) ≤ supx(x) (z's x-coordinates are within x's x-range)
3. infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x and z overlap in the x-direction, with x starting to the left)
4. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x) (x and z overlap in the x-direction, with z starting to the left)

However, the definition of "a N b" requires infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b). Applying this to our case, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z starts to the left of or at the same point as x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x ends to the left of or at the same point as z)

So, scenarios 1 and 4 are consistent with x N z. In contrast, scenarios 2 and 3 are not consistent with x N z.

Let's double-check scenarios 1 and 4:
Scenario 1: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
Scenario 4: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x)

Actually, scenario 4 is inconsistent with supx(x) ≤ supx(z), so it doesn't correspond to x N z. Only scenario 1 is consistent with x N z.

I think I need to clarify the definition of "a N b":
a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

This means that for a to be north of b, a must be above b, b's leftmost point must be to the left of a's leftmost point, and a's rightmost point must be to the left of b's rightmost point. In other words, a's x-range must be contained within b's x-range.

For x N z, we'd need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

We've already established supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we don't have direct constraints on the relationships between infx(z) and infx(x) or between supx(x) and supx(z). So, it's possible for x to be N of z, but it's not guaranteed.

For x NE z, we'd need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

We've established the first condition but not the second, so it's possible for x to be NE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

For x NW z, we'd need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

Again, we've established the first condition but not the second.

So, the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

But let me think about which of these are actually consistent with the given constraints.

The definition of a W b means a is completely to the west of b. And the definition of b NE c means b is completely to the northeast (which is both above and to the right) of c. This suggests there's a region of the plane to the west of y and northeast of z. But does this mean that there's a region of the plane that is, at the same time, completely to the west of z, north of z, and completely to the east of z? Let's think this through...

From "x is W of y", we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
From "y is NE of z", we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

Combining these, we get supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), which means both x and z are to the left of y. But we don't know the relative positions of x and z in the east-west direction; we just know they are both to the west of y.

From "y is NE of z", we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
From "x is W of y", we know infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

Combining these, we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z.

So, based on the constraints, x is above z, and both x and z are to the west of y. But we don't know the exact relationship between x and z in the east-west direction. Depending on their positions, x could be NW, N, or NE of z.

Actually, I'm making an error in reasoning. Let's clarify. For x to be NE of z, x needs to be both north of z and east of z. For x to be N of z, x needs to be north of z and have its x-range contained within z's x-range. For x to be NW of z, x needs to be both north of z and west of z.

We know that x is entirely above z, so the northern component of these relations is satisfied.

But for the east-west component, we need to check the relative positions of x and z.

For x to be east of z, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means z is entirely to the left of x. But we don't have direct constraints on this.

For x to be west of z, we'd need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z. Again, we don't have direct constraints on this.

What we do have is that both x and z are to the west of y. But without further constraints, both x E z and x W z are possible, as is the possibility that x and z overlap in the x-direction.

Let me draw a few example configurations to see if all possibilities are indeed valid:

Example 1: x is NW of z
x is to the west of y, and z is to the southwest of y. This is a valid configuration.

Example 2: x is N of z
x is to the west of y, and z is to the southwest of y, but in such a way that x's x-range falls entirely within z's x-range. This is also a valid configuration.

Example 3: x is NE of z
x is to the west of y, and z is to the southwest of y, but in such a way that z is to the west of x. This is also a valid configuration.

After careful consideration, I conclude that the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW
- N
- NE

Let me double-check by considering actual regions. Consider a simple case where regions are rectangles (which belong to REG).

Let z be the rectangle with bottom-left corner at (0,0) and top-right corner at (2,1).
Let y be the rectangle with bottom-left corner at (3,2) and top-right corner at (5,4).

We can verify that y is NE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) since 2 ≤ 3
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) since 1 ≤ 2

Now, for x, there are multiple possibilities:

Example 1: x is NW of z
Let x be the rectangle with bottom-left corner at (-2,2) and top-right corner at (-1,3).
Then x is W of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) since -1 ≤ 3
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) since 2 ≤ 2 and 3 ≤ 4
And x is NW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) since -1 ≤ 0
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) since 1 ≤ 2

Example 2: x is N of z
Let x be the rectangle with bottom-left corner at (0.5,2) and top-right corner at (1.5,3).
Then x is W of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) since 1.5 ≤ 3
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) since 2 ≤ 2 and 3 ≤ 4
And x is N of z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) since 1 ≤ 2
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) since 0 ≤ 0.5
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) since 1.5 ≤ 2

Example 3: x is NE of z
Let x be the rectangle with bottom-left corner at (2.5,2) and top-right corner at (2.8,3).
Then x is W of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) since 2.8 ≤ 3
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) since 2 ≤ 2 and 3 ≤ 4
And x is NE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) since 2 ≤ 2.5
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) since 1 ≤ 2

So, as demonstrated by these examples, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW
- N
- NE

But wait, I need to consider one more relation W. In this relation, the y-coordinates of x and z would overlap. This doesn't align with our constraint that x is entirely above z. So, W is not a possible relation between x and z.

Let me now consider SW, S, and SE. For these relations, x would need to be south of z, which is the opposite of what we've established. So, these are not possible relations.

Now, let's consider B and E:

For x B z, we would need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

But we've established that x is entirely above z, which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This contradicts the requirement for x B z. So, B is not a possible relation.

For x E z, we would need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Again, the constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts the requirement for x E z. So, E is not a possible relation.

Actually, I made a mistake in the definitions of the relations. Let me revisit:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

For a to be east of b, a must be to the right of b, and a and b must overlap in the y-direction. Since we've established that x is entirely above z, x E z isn't a valid relation.

So, after carefully rechecking all relations, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW
- N
- NE

I'm confident that this is the correct answer. The constraints tell us that x is entirely above z, but the east-west relationship between x and z is underdetermined. Depending on the exact positions, x could be to the west of z, have its x-range contained within z's x-range, or be to the east of z.

Let me do one final check to make sure this is correct:

Given:
1. Region x is W of region y
2. Region y is NE of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions and the constraints, we know:
- x is entirely to the west of y (follows from x W y)
- y is entirely to the northeast of z (follows from y NE z)
- x overlaps with y in the y-direction (follows from x W y)
- y is entirely above z (follows from y NE z)

From these, we can deduce that x is entirely above z. But we can't definitively determine the east-west relationship between x and z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW: If x is entirely to the west of z and above z
- N: If x's x-range is contained within z's x-range and x is above z
- NE: If x is entirely to the east of z and above z

Let me see if I'm overlooking any other possibilities.

For a relation like W, x would need to be entirely to the west of z and overlap with z in the y-direction. But since x is entirely above z, x W z isn't valid.

Similarly, for relations like SW, S, SE, B, and E, the y-coordinate constraints don't align with what we've established.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW
- N
- NE

I'm confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

From x W y, I know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the west of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x overlaps with y in the y-direction)

From y NE z, I know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is completely to the west of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is completely to the south of y)

Combining these constraints:
- x and z are both to the west of y, but their east-west relationship is not fixed
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is completely north of z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- NW (if x is west of z)
- N (if x's x-range is contained within z's x-range)
- NE (if x is east of z)
