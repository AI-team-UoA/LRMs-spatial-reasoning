PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's use the definitions of the cardinal direction relations to analyze this problem.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the definition:
- x NW y means: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's analyze what this implies for the relationship between x and z:

1) For the x-coordinate:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
   
   Note that this doesn't directly tell us how supx(x) and supx(z) relate. Both are less than or equal to infx(y), but we can't determine which one is larger or smaller.

2) For the y-coordinate:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
   
   Again, this doesn't tell us directly how infy(x) and infy(z) relate. Both are greater than or equal to supy(y), but we can't determine which one is larger or smaller.

Let's think about the possible relative positions of x and z:

Given that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), x and z could be to the left of y. But we don't know their relative positions with respect to each other.

Similarly, given that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), x and z could be above y. But we don't know their relative positions with respect to each other.

Let's consider different scenarios:

1) If supx(x) <= infx(z):
   - x could be to the west of z (W, NW, SW).
   
2) If supx(z) <= infx(x):
   - x could be to the east of z (E, NE, SE).
   
3) If there's overlap in the x-coordinate:
   - x could be in the same vertical band as z (N, B, S).

Similarly for the y-coordinate:

1) If supy(z) <= infy(x):
   - x could be to the north of z (N, NW, NE).
   
2) If supy(x) <= infy(z):
   - x could be to the south of z (S, SW, SE).
   
3) If there's overlap in the y-coordinate:
   - x could be in the same horizontal band as z (W, B, E).

Given the constraints that x is NW of y and y is SE of z, let's think about this more carefully.

If y is SE of z, then z is positioned in such a way that it's to the northwest of y. Similarly, if x is NW of y, then x is also positioned to the northwest of y.

This suggests that both x and z are to the northwest of y. But the relationship between x and z is not clear yet.

Let's see if I can derive more specific constraints:

For x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, from these constraints, we can't directly determine the relation between x and z. It depends on the relative positions of supx(x) and supx(z), as well as infy(x) and infy(z).

Let's think of different scenarios:

1) If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x): x is NW of z.
2) If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x): x is NE of z.
3) If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z): x is SW of z.
4) If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z): x is SE of z.
5) If supx(x) <= infx(z) and there's y-overlap: x is W of z.
6) If supx(z) <= infx(x) and there's y-overlap: x is E of z.
7) If there's x-overlap and supy(z) <= infy(x): x is N of z.
8) If there's x-overlap and supy(x) <= infy(z): x is S of z.
9) If there's both x-overlap and y-overlap: x is B of z.

Let me verify which of these scenarios are compatible with our given constraints.

I realize I've been approaching this somewhat incorrectly. Let's step back and think about the problem in a different way.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Let's draw a simple diagram to understand this better.

```
    x
       \
        \
         y
        /
       /
    z
```

From this diagram, it seems like x is in the NW direction from y, and z is in the NW direction from y as well (since y is SE of z). But this doesn't tell us the relation between x and z.

Let's think of it in terms of the bounding boxes. 

For x NW y:
- The maximum x-coordinate of x (supx(x)) is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of y (infx(y)).
- The maximum y-coordinate of y (supy(y)) is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x (infy(x)).

For y SE z:
- The maximum x-coordinate of z (supx(z)) is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of y (infx(y)).
- The maximum y-coordinate of y (supy(y)) is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of z (infy(z)).

From these, we can see that both x and z are to the left of y (in terms of the x-coordinate) and both are above y (in terms of the y-coordinate). But we can't determine the relation between x and z from these constraints alone.

Specifically, we don't know which of the following is true:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) or supx(z) <= infx(x) or there's x-overlap.
- supy(z) <= infy(x) or supy(x) <= infy(z) or there's y-overlap.

So it seems that all the cardinal directions could be possible for the relation between x and z.

Wait, I'm making an error in my analysis. I need to think more clearly:

For x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y on the x-axis)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y on the y-axis)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the left of y on the x-axis)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is above y on the y-axis)

Now, consider the x-axis:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)

Given that both supx(x) and supx(z) are less than or equal to infx(y), we can't directly determine which of supx(x) or supx(z) is larger. They could be in any order, or they could be equal.

Now, consider the y-axis:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

Similarly, both infy(x) and infy(z) are greater than or equal to supy(y), but we can't determine which one is larger or smaller.

This means that depending on the exact positions of x and z, any of the cardinal direction relations could be possible for the relation between x and z.

Let's verify each possibility:

1) N: This is possible if x and z have an x-coordinate overlap and x is above z.
2) NE: This is possible if x is to the right of and above z.
3) E: This is possible if x is to the right of z and they have a y-coordinate overlap.
4) SE: This is possible if x is to the right of and below z.
5) S: This is possible if x and z have an x-coordinate overlap and x is below z.
6) SW: This is possible if x is to the left of and below z.
7) W: This is possible if x is to the left of z and they have a y-coordinate overlap.
8) NW: This is possible if x is to the left of and above z.
9) B: This is possible if x and z have both x-coordinate and y-coordinate overlaps.

It's important to check if each of these possibilities is consistent with our given constraints.

Hmm, let's just analyze whether some relations can be ruled out. 

If supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), then x and z are both to the left of y. This means that x is not necessarily to the right of z (and vice versa). Similarly, both x and z are above y. But the relative position of x and z can vary.

Actually, let me reconsider this problem from a geometric perspective. 

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

If y is SE of z, that means z is NW of y. 

So both x and z are NW of y. But the relation between x and z is what we're trying to determine.

Thinking of a coordinate system, if (x1, y1) represents a point in region x, (x2, y2) represents a point in region y, and (x3, y3) represents a point in region z, then:

For x to be NW of y:
- x1 < x2
- y1 > y2

For y to be SE of z:
- x2 > x3
- y2 < y3

From these, we can derive:
- x1 < x2 and x2 > x3, but we can't determine the relation between x1 and x3.
- y1 > y2 and y2 < y3, but we can't determine the relation between y1 and y3.

So, based on the given constraints, the relation between x and z can be any of the cardinal directions.

Wait, I realized there's a logical way to approach this. Let me draw out the possible positions of x, y, and z based on the constraints.

If we divide the plane into a 9x9 grid centered at y, then:
- x is in the NW cell since x is NW of y.
- z is in the NW cell since y is SE of z (meaning z is NW of y).

But within the NW cell, x and z can be positioned in different ways, leading to various cardinal direction relations between them.

Let's systematically check for each relation:

1) N: If x is directly above z, then x can be N of z, i.e., x is to the north of z.
2) NE: If x is to the right and above z, then x can be NE of z, i.e., x is to the northeast of z.
3) E: If x is to the right of z and at the same vertical level, then x can be E of z, i.e., x is to the east of z.
4) SE: If x is to the right and below z, then x can be SE of z, i.e., x is to the southeast of z.
5) S: If x is directly below z, then x can be S of z, i.e., x is to the south of z.
6) SW: If x is to the left and below z, then x can be SW of z, i.e., x is to the southwest of z.
7) W: If x is to the left of z and at the same vertical level, then x can be W of z, i.e., x is to the west of z.
8) NW: If x is to the left and above z, then x can be NW of z, i.e., x is to the northwest of z.
9) B: If x and z overlap in both x and y coordinates, then x can be B (bounding box) of z.

Given that both x and z are in the NW cell relative to y, all these relations are plausible without further constraints.

Actually I realize I'm doing something wrong, because the problem is about the projection of the regions on the x-axis and y-axis.

Let's be clearer and utilize the exact definitions.

From the definition of NW:
- x NW y means: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y) and supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z), but this doesn't tell us the relation between supx(x) and supx(z) or between infx(x) and infx(z).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z), but this doesn't tell us the relation between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z).

Since we only have these constraints, and there are no other constraints on the relations between x and z, all cardinal direction relations between x and z are plausible.

So, let me list them all out:

1) N (North): x is to the north of z, which means infx(x) <= supx(z) AND infx(z) <= supx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
2) NE (Northeast): x is to the northeast of z, which means supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
3) E (East): x is to the east of z, which means supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(x) <= supy(z) AND infy(z) <= supy(x).
4) SE (Southeast): x is to the southeast of z, which means supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
5) S (South): x is to the south of z, which means infx(x) <= supx(z) AND infx(z) <= supx(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
6) SW (Southwest): x is to the southwest of z, which means supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
7) W (West): x is to the west of z, which means supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infy(x) <= supy(z) AND infy(z) <= supy(x).
8) NW (Northwest): x is to the northwest of z, which means supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
9) B (Bounding Box): x is within the bounding box of z, which means infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's reconsider if all these relations are plausible given our initial constraints.

Actually, I think I need to review my understanding of the definitions because I'm struggling to make progress. Let me redefine the relations and then analyze:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now, using these definitions, let's analyze our problem:

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's try to determine all possible relations between x and z.

For x N z (North), we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (i.e., z should be below x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (i.e., the left edge of z should be to the left of the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (i.e., the right edge of x should be to the left of the right edge of z)

Is this plausible? Let's check:
- From our given constraints, we know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), but this doesn't tell us the relation between infy(x) and infy(z). So, it's plausible that supy(z) <= infy(x).
- Similarly, our constraints don't tell us anything about the relation between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z). So, the other two conditions for x N z are also plausible.

Thus, x N z (North) is a plausible relation.

For x NE z (Northeast), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (i.e., z should be to the left of x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (i.e., z should be below x)

Is this plausible? Let's check:
- From our given constraints, we know that supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y), but this doesn't tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x). So, it's plausible that supx(z) <= infx(x).
- As shown above, it's also plausible that supy(z) <= infy(x).

Thus, x NE z (Northeast) is a plausible relation.

For x E z (East), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (i.e., z should be to the left of x)
- infy(x) <= supy(z) (i.e., the bottom of x should be below the top of z)
- infy(z) <= supy(x) (i.e., the bottom of z should be below the top of x)

Is this plausible? Let's check:
- As shown above, it's plausible that supx(z) <= infx(x).
- Our constraints don't tell us anything about the relations between infy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(z) and supy(x). So, the other two conditions for x E z are also plausible.

Thus, x E z (East) is a plausible relation.

For x SE z (Southeast), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (i.e., z should be to the left of x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (i.e., x should be below z)

Is this plausible? Let's check:
- As shown above, it's plausible that supx(z) <= infx(x).
- From our given constraints, we know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), but this doesn't tell us the relation between supy(x) and infy(z). So, it's plausible that supy(x) <= infy(z).

Thus, x SE z (Southeast) is a plausible relation.

For x S z (South), we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (i.e., x should be below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (i.e., the left edge of z should be to the left of the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (i.e., the right edge of x should be to the left of the right edge of z)

Is this plausible? Let's check:
- As shown above, it's plausible that supy(x) <= infy(z).
- Our constraints don't tell us anything about the relations between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z). So, the other two conditions for x S z are also plausible.

Thus, x S z (South) is a plausible relation.

For x SW z (Southwest), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (i.e., x should be to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (i.e., x should be below z)

Is this plausible? Let's check:
- From our given constraints, we know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), but this doesn't tell us the relation between supx(x) and infx(z). So, it's plausible that supx(x) <= infx(z).
- As shown above, it's plausible that supy(x) <= infy(z).

Thus, x SW z (Southwest) is a plausible relation.

For x W z (West), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (i.e., x should be to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= supy(x) (i.e., the bottom of z should be below the top of x)
- infy(x) <= supy(z) (i.e., the bottom of x should be below the top of z)

Is this plausible? Let's check:
- As shown above, it's plausible that supx(x) <= infx(z).
- Our constraints don't tell us anything about the relations between infy(z) and supy(x) or between infy(x) and supy(z). So, the other two conditions for x W z are also plausible.

Thus, x W z (West) is a plausible relation.

For x NW z (Northwest), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (i.e., x should be to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (i.e., z should be below x)

Is this plausible? Let's check:
- As shown above, it's plausible that supx(x) <= infx(z).
- As shown above, it's plausible that supy(z) <= infy(x).

Thus, x NW z (Northwest) is a plausible relation.

For x B z (bounding box), we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (i.e., the left edge of x should be to the right of the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (i.e., the right edge of x should be to the left of the right edge of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (i.e., the bottom of x should be above the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (i.e., the top of x should be below the top of z)

Is this plausible? Let's check:
- Our constraints don't tell us anything about the relations between infx(x) and infx(z), between supx(x) and supx(z), between infy(x) and infy(z), or between supy(x) and supy(z). So, all four conditions for x B z are plausible.

Thus, x B z (bounding box) is a plausible relation.

Actually, I'm worried that I'm being overly thorough here. Let's double-check by drawing out two scenarios with the given constraints:

First way to picture it:
```
    x
    |
    | 
    |
    z --- y
```

In this scenario, x is positioned north of z.


Second way to picture it:
```
    x --- z
         /
        /
       y
```

In this scenario, x is positioned west of z.

Both of these show different relations between x and z: Specifically in the first example, x is N of z, while in the second example, x is W of z. This means that the relation between x and z can vary given the constraints.

However, I'm still concerned I might be missing something. Let's be even more systematic.

For x NW y, we have:
- The supx(x) <= infx(y), meaning x is to the left of y.
- The supy(y) <= infy(x), meaning x is above y.

For y SE z, we have:
- The supx(z) <= infx(y), meaning z is to the left of y.
- The supy(y) <= infy(z), meaning z is above y.

So, both x and z are to the left of and above y. But their relative positions to each other are not constrained.

Let me try to construct an example for each of the nine possible relations between x and z to see if they are all plausible.

1. x N z (North):
   - Let's place x at (0, 3), z at (0, 0), and y at (3, -3).
   - This gives: supx(x) = 1, infx(y) = 2 (so supx(x) <= infx(y)), and supy(y) = -2, infy(x) = 2 (so supy(y) <= infy(x)), satisfying x NW y.
   - And: supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2 (so supx(z) <= infx(y)), and supy(y) = -2, infy(z) = 0 (so supy(y) <= infy(z)), satisfying y SE z.
   - Furthermore, x is directly above z, satisfying x N z.

2. x NE z (Northeast):
   - Let's place x at (2, 3), z at (0, 0), and y at (3, -3).
   - This gives: supx(x) = 3, infx(y) = 2 (so supx(x) > infx(y)), which doesn't satisfy x NW y.
   - Let me try again with x at (1, 3).
   - Now: supx(x) = 2, infx(y) = 2 (so supx(x) <= infx(y)), and supy(y) = -2, infy(x) = 2 (so supy(y) <= infy(x)), satisfying x NW y.
   - And: supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2 (so supx(z) <= infx(y)), and supy(y) = -2, infy(z) = 0 (so supy(y) <= infy(z)), satisfying y SE z.
   - Furthermore, x is to the right and above z, satisfying x NE z.

3. x E z (East):
   - Let's place x at (2, 0), z at (0, 0), and y at (3, -3).
   - This gives: supx(x) = 3, infx(y) = 2 (so supx(x) > infx(y)), which doesn't satisfy x NW y.
   - Let me try again with x at (1, 0).
   - Now: supx(x) = 2, infx(y) = 2 (so supx(x) <= infx(y)), and supy(y) = -2, infy(x) = 0 (so supy(y) <= infy(x)), satisfying x NW y.
   - And: supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2 (so supx(z) <= infx(y)), and supy(y) = -2, infy(z) = 0 (so supy(y) <= infy(z)), satisfying y SE z.
   - Furthermore, x is to the right of z, satisfying x E z.

Ok I'm getting confused by my own examples because we're working with regions that have an interior. Let me think about this more simply.

The constraint says x is NW of y, i.e., supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

I'm thinking about the regions as points, but that's incorrect. Let me think about them as regions:

For x NW y, imagine x is a square in the top-left corner and y is a square in the bottom-right corner of a 2x2 grid. The conditions supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) ensure that x is to the northwest of y. The two squares don't overlap in x or y coordinates.

Similarly, for y SE z, z is a square in the top-left corner and y is a square in the bottom-right corner. Again, the two squares don't overlap.

But the relative positions of x and z are not constrained. They could overlap, one could be contained in the other, or they could be separate with any cardinal direction relation.

Let me try to create an example for each of the 9 cardinal direction relations and check if it's consistent with the given constraints.

1. x N z (North):
   - x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6
   - z: infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3
   - y: infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1
   - Check x NW y: supx(x) = 3 <= infx(y) = 4 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 4. So, x is NW of y.
   - Check y SE z: supx(z) = 3 <= infx(y) = 4 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(z) = 1. So, y is SE of z.
   - Check x N z: supy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) = 4, infx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 1 (which is =), and supx(x) = 3 <= supx(z) = 3 (which is =). So, x is N of z.

This seems plausible!

2. x NE z (Northeast):
   - x: infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 6, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6
   - z: infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3
   - y: infx(y) = 7, supx(y) = 9, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1
   - Check x NW y: supx(x) = 6 <= infx(y) = 7 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 4. So, x is NW of y.
   - Check y SE z: supx(z) = 3 <= infx(y) = 7 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(z) = 1. So, y is SE of z.
   - Check x NE z: supx(z) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4 and supy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) = 4. So, x is NE of z.

This seems plausible!

Let me skip to a relation that might be more challenging:

9. x B z (bounding box):
   - x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4
   - z: infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 5
   - y: infx(y) = 6, supx(y) = 8, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1
   - Check x NW y: supx(x) = 4 <= infx(y) = 6 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2. So, x is NW of y.
   - Check y SE z: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(z) = 1. So, y is SE of z.
   - Check x B z: infx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4 <= supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, and supy(x) = 4 <= supy(z) = 5. So, x is B of z.

This seems plausible!

I think all 9 cardinal direction relations are plausible for the relation between x and z given the constraints that x is NW of y and y is SE of z.

Actually, let's double-check B:
- x B z means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Given:
- x NW y means supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y SE z means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

From these, we get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), but we can't determine the relation between supx(x) and supx(z).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), but we can't determine the relation between infy(x) and infy(z).

So, it's plausible that infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), making x B z a plausible relation.

In fact, I think all of the 9 cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are plausible for the relation between x and z given the constraints.

Let's just double check a couple more:

3. x E z (East):
   - x: infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 6, infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 3
   - z: infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3
   - y: infx(y) = 7, supx(y) = 9, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1
   - Check x NW y: supx(x) = 6 <= infx(y) = 7 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 1 (which is =). So, x is NW of y.
   - Check y SE z: supx(z) = 3 <= infx(y) = 7 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(z) = 1. So, y is SE of z.
   - Check x E z: supx(z) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 1 <= supy(z) = 3, and infy(z) = 1 <= supy(x) = 3. So, x is E of z.

This seems plausible!

4. x SE z (Southeast):
   - x: infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 6, infy(x) = -2, supy(x) = 0
   - z: infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3
   - y: infx(y) = 7, supx(y) = 9, infy(y) = -4, supy(y) = -2
   - Check x NW y: supx(x) = 6 <= infx(y) = 7 and supy(y) = -2 <= infy(x) = -2 (which is =). So, x is NW of y.
   - Check y SE z: supx(z) = 3 <= infx(y) = 7 and supy(y) = -2 <= infy(z) = 1. So, y is SE of z.
   - Check x SE z: supx(z) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4 and supy(x) = 0 <= infy(z) = 1. So, x is SE of z.

This seems plausible!

5. x S z (South):
   - x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = -2, supy(x) = 0
   - z: infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3
   - y: infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = -4, supy(y) = -2
   - Check x NW y: supx(x) = 3 <= infx(y) = 4 and supy(y) = -2 <= infy(x) = -2 (which is =). So, x is NW of y.
   - Check y SE z: supx(z) = 3 <= infx(y) = 4 and supy(y) = -2 <= infy(z) = 1. So, y is SE of z.
   - Check x S z: supy(x) = 0 <= infy(z) = 1, infx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 1 (which is =), and supx(x) = 3 <= supx(z) = 3 (which is =). So, x is S of z.

This seems plausible!

Okay I've verified that all of the 9 cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are plausible for the relation between x and z given the constraints.

So the full list of possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to analyze the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

From the definitions:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, both x and z are positioned to the left of y (in terms of x-coordinate) and above y (in terms of y-coordinate). However, the constraints don't determine the exact relationship between x and z.

I can verify through coordinate examples that any of the cardinal directions could be satisfied while maintaining the given constraints.

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
