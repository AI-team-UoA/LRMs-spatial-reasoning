PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step:

1. Region x is W of region y. This means:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x has vertical overlap with y)

2. Region y is SE of region z. This means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between region x and region z:

From 1 and 2, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from 1)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from 2)

However, these don't give us a direct constraint between supx(x) and infx(z) or infx(x) and supx(z). So we can't determine the east-west relationship between x and z directly.

From 1 and 2, we also know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 1)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from 2)

Combining these:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies that region x is below region z in terms of the y-coordinate.

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z based on these constraints.

If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x could be S, SW, or SE of z, depending on the east-west relationship.

Let's consider the east-west relationship more carefully:
- If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is W of z.
- If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is E of z.
- If there's an overlap in the x-coordinates, then x is neither strictly W nor strictly E of z.

Let's combine these with the north-south relationship (x is S of z):
- If x is S of z and W of z, then x is SW of z.
- If x is S of z and E of z, then x is SE of z.
- If x is S of z and neither strictly W nor strictly E of z, then x is S of z.

But wait, we need to check if these are consistent with the given constraints.

From 1, we know supx(x) <= infx(y).
From 2, we know supx(z) <= infx(y).

So, both x and z are to the west of y. However, we don't know the relative positions of x and z in the east-west direction.

From 1, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
From 2, we know supy(y) <= infy(z).

So, y is above x but below z. However, this doesn't directly tell us the relative positions of x and z in the north-south direction, except that x is below z (supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)).

Let's visualize this:
- z is in the north.
- y is to the southeast of z.
- x is to the west of y.

Based on this, x could be:
- SW of z (if x is to the west of z).
- S of z (if x has some east-west overlap with z).
- SE of z (if x is to the east of z).
- W of z (if x has some north-south overlap with z and is to the west of z).
- NW of z (if x is to the northwest of z).

Let's double-check these possibilities:

1. x could be SW of z:
   - This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't have a direct constraint between supx(x) and infx(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - So, x could be SW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z).

2. x could be S of z:
   - This means infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We don't have direct constraints between infx(z) and infx(x) or between supx(x) and supx(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - So, x could be S of z if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

3. x could be SE of z:
   - This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y), but we don't have a direct constraint between supx(z) and infx(x).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - So, x could be SE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x).

4. x could be W of z:
   - This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't have a direct constraint between supx(x) and infx(z).
   - We don't have direct constraints between infy(z) and infy(x) or between supy(x) and supy(z).
   - So, x could be W of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

5. x could be NW of z:
   - This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't have a direct constraint between supx(x) and infx(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - So, x cannot be NW of z.

Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me be clearer about the constraints:

From "x is W of y":
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now let's analyze what these constraints tell us about the relationship between x and z.

For the east-west relation between x and z:
- We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y).
- This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(z) and infx(x).
- So, x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or have an east-west overlap with z.

For the north-south relation between x and z:
- We know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- We also know supy(y) <= infy(z).
- Combining these, we get supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
- This means x is south of z (or at least, the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z).

Given that x is south of z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is to the west of z)
- S (if x has an east-west overlap with z)
- SE (if x is to the east of z)

Let's check if there are any other constraints that might rule out any of these possibilities.

From the given constraints, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the west of y)

Since both x and z are to the west of y, and we don't have a direct constraint between the east-west positions of x and z, all three possibilities (SW, S, SE) are valid.

Actually, let me double-check this more carefully. I think there might be additional constraints I'm missing.

From "x is W of y":
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from "x is W of y")
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y is SE of z")

These don't give us a direct constraint between supx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(z) and infx(x). So, in terms of the east-west relationship, x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or have an east-west overlap with z.

For the north-south relationship:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from "x is W of y")
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from "y is SE of z")

Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z. In other words, x is completely south of z.

Given that x is south of z, and considering the east-west relationship, the possible cardinal direction relations are:
- SW (if x is to the west of z)
- S (if x has an east-west overlap with z)
- SE (if x is to the east of z)

But wait, I need to be more careful here. Let's consider the east-west relationship more precisely:

Given that supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y), we have both x and z to the west of y. But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z in the east-west direction.

So, based on the given constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is to the west of z)
- S (if x has an east-west overlap with z)
- SE (if x is to the east of z)
- W (if x is to the west of z and has a north-south overlap with z)

But wait, we already established that x is completely south of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)). This rules out the W relation, as W requires a north-south overlap.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- SW
- S
- SE

Actually, wait. Let me do one more check. Let's draw a visual representation:

Suppose the bounding box of z is a square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).
If y is SE of z, then y must be in the bottom-right quadrant relative to z. Let's say the bounding box of y has corners at (2, -2), (3, -2), (2, -1), and (3, -1).
If x is W of y, then x must be to the left of y with some vertical overlap. Let's say the bounding box of x has corners at (0, -2), (1, -2), (0, -1), and (1, -1).

With this setup:
- z has bounding box (0, 0) to (1, 1).
- y has bounding box (2, -2) to (3, -1).
- x has bounding box (0, -2) to (1, -1).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- In the east-west direction, x and z have an overlap (both have x-coordinates from 0 to 1).
- In the north-south direction, x is below z (x's y-coordinates are from -2 to -1, while z's are from 0 to 1).

So, in this example, x is S of z.

But wait, I've been making a mistake. I've been assuming that the conditions in the definitions of cardinal direction relations are both necessary and sufficient. But they're just necessary conditions.

Let me check the definitions again:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

This means:
- The northernmost point of a is south of the southernmost point of b.
- The westernmost point of a is east of or at the same longitude as the westernmost point of b.
- The easternmost point of a is west of or at the same longitude as the easternmost point of b.

In other words, a is completely south of b and within the east-west extent of b.

a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

This means:
- The easternmost point of a is west of the westernmost point of b.
- The northernmost point of a is south of the southernmost point of b.

In other words, a is completely southwest of b.

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

This means:
- The westernmost point of a is east of the easternmost point of b.
- The northernmost point of a is south of the southernmost point of b.

In other words, a is completely southeast of b.

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means:
- The easternmost point of a is west of the westernmost point of b.
- The southernmost point of a is north of or at the same latitude as the southernmost point of b.
- The northernmost point of a is south of or at the same latitude as the northernmost point of b.

In other words, a is completely west of b and has some vertical overlap with b.

Given the constraints:
- "x is W of y" means supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- "y is SE of z" means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

To determine the possible relations between x and z, let's consider the nine cardinal direction relations:

1. Can x be B of z?
   - This would require infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). 
   - But B requires supy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x). These, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), would mean infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z). This is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.
   - So, x is generally not B of z.

2. Can x be S of z?
   - This would require supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We don't have direct constraints on infx(z) vs. infx(x) or supx(x) vs. supx(z). So, this relation is possible.

3. Can x be SW of z?
   - This would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) vs. infx(z). So, this relation is possible.

4. Can x be W of z?
   - This would require supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the requirement of infy(z) <= infy(x) for W, unless infy(x) = infy(z).
   - So, x can be W of z only in a very specific scenario, which doesn't generally hold.

5. Can x be NW of z?
   - This would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). This, combined with supy(z) <= infy(x) (required for NW), would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This doesn't give a direct contradiction, but it seems very specific.
   - Actually, let's check: if supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then we'd have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This can be consistent if infy(z) = supy(z) = infy(x). But that's a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.
   - So, x is generally not NW of z.

6. Can x be N of z?
   - This would require supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the requirement of supy(z) <= infy(x) for N, unless supy(z) = infy(x).
   - So, x can be N of z only in a very specific scenario, which doesn't generally hold.

7. Can x be NE of z?
   - This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the requirement of supy(z) <= infy(x) for NE, unless supy(z) = infy(x).
   - So, x can be NE of z only in a very specific scenario, which doesn't generally hold.

8. Can x be E of z?
   - This would require supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the requirement of infy(z) <= infy(x) for E, unless infy(x) = infy(z).
   - So, x can be E of z only in a very specific scenario, which doesn't generally hold.

9. Can x be SE of z?
   - This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y), but we don't have a direct constraint on supx(z) vs. infx(x). So, this relation is possible.

Given the constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- S (if x has an east-west overlap with z)
- SW (if x is to the west of z)
- SE (if x is to the east of z)

The other relations (B, W, NW, N, NE, E) are generally not possible or are only possible in very specific boundary scenarios.

So, the answer is: S, SW, SE.

Actually, let me be even more rigorous and check through the definitions of the cardinal relations again:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Given the constraints:
- "x is W of y" means supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- "y is SE of z" means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Can x be B of z? For this, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From "x is W of y," we have supx(x) <= infx(y), which means x is strictly to the west of y. From "y is SE of z," we have supx(z) <= infx(y), which means z is strictly to the west of y. But this doesn't tell us the direct relationship between x and z in the east-west direction. So, it's possible for infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) to be satisfied.

From "x is W of y," we have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). From "y is SE of z," we have supy(y) <= infy(z). Combining these, we get supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). Since supy(x) <= infy(z), and given that z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z), we have supy(x) <= supy(z). But for x to be B of z, we also need infy(z) <= infy(x). This, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), would mean infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z). This is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, x is generally not B of z.

Can x be S of z? For this, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From the constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). We don't have direct constraints on infx(z) vs. infx(x) or supx(x) vs. supx(z). So, this relation is possible.

Can x be SW of z? For this, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). We don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) vs. infx(z). So, this relation is possible.

Can x be W of z? For this, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). For x to be W of z, we also need infy(z) <= infy(x). This, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), would mean supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). Given that x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), gives infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z), which is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, x is generally not W of z. But in that very specific case where infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z), it could be W of z.

Can x be NW of z? For this, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From the constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). And since z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z). But for x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). This, combined with supy(x) <= supy(z), would mean supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). Given that x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which, combined with supy(x) <= supy(z), gives supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z), which is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, x is generally not NW of z.

Can x be N of z? For this, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From the constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). And since z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z). But for x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). This, combined with supy(x) <= supy(z), would mean supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). Given that x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which, combined with supy(x) <= supy(z), gives supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z), which is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, x is generally not N of z.

Can x be NE of z? For this, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From the constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y). But this doesn't give us a direct constraint on supx(z) vs. infx(x).

From the constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). And since z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z). But for x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). This, combined with supy(x) <= supy(z), would mean supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). Given that x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which, combined with supy(x) <= supy(z), gives supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z), which is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, x is generally not NE of z. But in that very specific case where infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z), and if supx(z) <= infx(x), it could be NE of z.

Can x be E of z? For this, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y). But this doesn't give us a direct constraint on supx(z) vs. infx(x).

From the constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). For x to be E of z, we also need infy(z) <= infy(x). This, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), would mean supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). Given that x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), gives infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z), which is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, x is generally not E of z. But in that very specific case where infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z), and if supx(z) <= infx(x), it could be E of z.

Can x be SE of z? For this, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).

From the constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y). But this doesn't give us a direct constraint on supx(z) vs. infx(x). So, this relation is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x).

In summary, from the given constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- S (if x has an east-west overlap with z)
- SW (if x is to the west of z)
- SE (if x is to the east of z)

The other relations (B, W, NW, N, NE, E) are generally not possible or are only possible in very specific boundary scenarios where certain coordinates are exactly equal. These boundary cases are mathematically possible but they represent very specific configurations where regions touch but don't overlap. In general, we would consider the more robust relations that don't require such exact equality. But if you need a complete thorough answer, then those boundary cases should be noted.

Actually, let me reason through this one more time. Let's try to be super precise and correct.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y.
- Region y is SE of region z.

From these, we get:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (from "x is W of y")
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from "x is W of y")
3. supx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y is SE of z")
4. supy(y) <= infy(z) (from "y is SE of z")

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Relation: B
For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From (2) and (4), we have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z). This doesn't give us a direct constraint between infy(x) and infy(z). So, it's possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) to be true.

From (2) and (4), we also have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). Given that z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z).

For the east-west constraints, we don't have a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z). 

However, from (1) and (3), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y). This means both x and z are to the west of y. But we don't know their relative positions. It's possible for infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) to be true.

So, it's possible for x to be B of z. But this would mean that the northern part of x aligns exactly with the southern part of z, which is a very specific scenario. In most general cases, x would not be B of z.

Let me clarify a point above: from (2) and (4), we have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z). This isn't giving us a direct constraint between infy(x) and infy(z). BUT we also have from (2) and (4) that supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). So, supy(x) <= infy(z). For x to be B of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x). But given that both x and z are regions, we have infy(x) <= supy(x) and infy(z) <= supy(z). Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which means infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z). This is a very specific and degenerate case, and isn't generally true. So, in most cases, x cannot be B of z.

Relation: S
For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

From (2) and (4), we have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). So, supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the east-west constraints, we don't have a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z).

So, it's possible for x to be S of z.

Relation: SW
For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From (2) and (4), we have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). So, supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the east-west constraint, we don't have a direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

So, it's possible for x to be SW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z).

Relation: W
For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From (2) and (4), we have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). Given that z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z).

But for x to be W of z, we also need infy(z) <= infy(x). From (2), we have infy(y) <= infy(x). And from (4), we know supy(y) <= infy(z). But there's no direct constraint between infy(y) and supy(y), so we can't conclude a direct relationship between infy(z) and infy(x) simply from these.

However, combining infy(z) <= infy(x) (needed for W) with supy(x) <= infy(z) (derived earlier), we get infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This mean infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). This is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, in general, x cannot be W of z. But in that very specific case, it could be.

Relation: NW
For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From (2) and (4), we have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). Given that z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z). Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z). But for x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). This, combined with supy(x) <= supy(z), becomes supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). Given that x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). Combining again, we get supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This means supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). This is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, in general, x cannot be NW of z. But in that very specific case, if supx(x) <= infx(z), it could be.

Relation: N
For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Similar to the reasoning for NW, from the constraints, we can derive supy(x) <= supy(z). But for x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). These combined would mean supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). Given that x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). This leads to supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). This is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, in general, x cannot be N of z. But in that very specific case, if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), it could be.

Relation: NE
For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Similar to the reasoning for NW, from the constraints, we can derive supy(x) <= supy(z). But for x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). These combined would mean supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). Given that x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). This leads to supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). This is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, in general, x cannot be NE of z. But in that very specific case, if supx(z) <= infx(x), it could be.

Relation: E
For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From (2) and (4), we have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). Given that z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z).

But for x to be E of z, we also need infy(z) <= infy(x). Combining this with supy(x) <= infy(z) (derived earlier), we get infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This means infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). This is a very specific scenario and doesn't generally hold.

So, in general, x cannot be E of z. But in that very specific case, if supx(z) <= infx(x), it could be.

Relation: SE
For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From (2) and (4), we have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). So, supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the east-west constraint, from (1) and (3), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y). But this doesn't give us a direct constraint between supx(z) and infx(x).

So, it's possible for x to be SE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x).

To summarize, from the given constraints, the most general and likely cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- S (if x has an east-west overlap with z)
- SW (if x is to the west of z)
- SE (if x is to the east of z)

The other relations (B, W, NW, N, NE, E) are generally not possible for arbitrary regions that satisfy the given constraints. They might be possible in specific degenerate cases.

And wait, let's double check the B relation one more time. We need
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We had
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

So,
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Given that z is a region, infy(z) <= supy(z). So,
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

For B, we also need infy(z) <= infy(x). Given that both x and z are regions, infy(x) <= supy(x) and infy(z) <= supy(z).

Combining infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(x), we get infy(z) <= supy(x). But we also have supy(x) <= infy(z). This means infy(z) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies infy(z) = supy(x). This is a very specific scenario where the northernmost point of x is exactly at the same latitude as the southernmost point of z. In such a case, x and z are touching but not overlapping in the north-south direction.

Similarly, for B, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Combined with the fact that regions x and z are non-empty, this means that x and z have an overlap in the east-west direction. This is possible under the given constraints.

So, in a very specific scenario where the northernmost point of x is exactly at the same latitude as the southernmost point of z and they overlap in the east-west direction, x can be B of z. But this is a degenerate case and not a general result for arbitrary regions satisfying the given constraints.

Actually, let me be super precise about the B relation. The definition of x B z is:

x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

That is, x is completely contained in the bounding box of z.

Now, we derived:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

For B, we need infy(z) <= infy(x). Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Since x is a region, infy(x) <= supy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This means infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). This is a very specific and degenerate case.

So, in general, x cannot be B of z. There's a boundary case, but it's a very specific scenario.

In conclusion, the possible cardinal direction relations (in a general case) between x and z given the constraints are:
- S
- SW
- SE

The answer is S, SW, SE.

S, SW, SE
