PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

In this question, we're given that:
1. Region x is NW of region y.
2. Region y is B of region z.

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let me analyze the given relations:

1. If x is NW of y, then according to the definition:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y in the x-axis)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y in the y-axis)

2. If y is B of z, then according to the definition:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's minimum x-coordinate is greater than or equal to z's minimum x-coordinate)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's maximum x-coordinate is less than or equal to z's maximum x-coordinate)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's minimum y-coordinate is greater than or equal to z's minimum y-coordinate)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to z's maximum y-coordinate)

Now, let's try to understand the relation between x and z:

From (1), we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y in the x-axis)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y in the y-axis)

From (2), we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's minimum x-coordinate is greater than or equal to z's minimum x-coordinate)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's maximum x-coordinate is less than or equal to z's maximum x-coordinate)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's minimum y-coordinate is greater than or equal to z's minimum y-coordinate)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to z's maximum y-coordinate)

From the first point of (1) and the first point of (2), we can infer:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
- But this doesn't give us a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z). It could be that supx(x) <= infx(z) or supx(x) > infx(z).

From the second point of (1) and the fourth point of (2), we can infer:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
- This implies that infy(x) could be related to supy(z) in different ways. It could be that infy(x) > supy(z) or infy(x) <= supy(z).

Given these scenarios, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NW of z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
3. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is N of z.
4. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is B of z.
5. If supx(z) < infx(x) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NE of z.
6. If supx(z) < infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.

Wait, I made a mistake above. If x is NW of y, then:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y in the x-axis)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y in the y-axis)

But that would mean that x is below y on the y-axis, which is the opposite of what NW implies. Let me rethink this.

Alright, I realize that the definitions might seem a bit confusing due to the way the cardinal directions are defined. Let me clarify:

- When we say "a is NW of b", it means that a is to the left of b and above b. In our definitions, this means that supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

Let's try once more:

1. If x is NW of y, then:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y in the x-axis)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y in the y-axis)

2. If y is B of z, then:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's minimum x-coordinate is less than or equal to y's minimum x-coordinate)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's maximum x-coordinate is less than or equal to z's maximum x-coordinate)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's minimum y-coordinate is less than or equal to y's minimum y-coordinate)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to z's maximum y-coordinate)

Now, let's analyze: From (1) and (2), we can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's consider some specific cases to determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), x is to the left of z, satisfying the conditions for W, NW, or SW.
2. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z), x overlaps with z in the x-direction, satisfying the conditions for B, N, or S.
3. If supx(z) < infx(x), x is to the right of z, satisfying the conditions for E, NE, or SE.

Similarly, in the y-direction:
1. If supy(z) < infy(x), x is above z, satisfying the conditions for N, NE, or NW.
2. If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), x is bounded within z in the y-direction, satisfying the conditions for B, E, or W.
3. If supy(x) <= infy(z), x is below z, satisfying the conditions for S, SE, or SW.

Let's consider the constraints we have:
- From "x is NW of y", we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- From "y is B of z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y): This doesn't provide a clear relation between supx(x) and infx(z). We can have cases where supx(x) <= infx(z) or infx(z) < supx(x).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z): This tells us that infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(z) >= supy(y). But it doesn't give us a clear relation between infy(x) and supy(z). We can have cases where infy(x) > supy(z) or infy(x) <= supy(z).

Given these ambiguities, let's enumerate the possible scenarios for the relation between x and z:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NW of z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
3. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SW of z.
4. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is N of z.
5. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x could be in the B relation with z, but we need to check if x is fully contained within z.
6. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is S of z.
7. If supx(z) < infx(x) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NE of z.
8. If supx(z) < infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.
9. If supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z.

However, I need to filter out the impossible scenarios given the constraints:

We know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
This means:
- If infx(z) > supx(x), then x is to the left of z. (This corresponds to W, NW, or SW).
- If infx(z) <= supx(x), then x might overlap with z in the x-direction, or be to its right. (This corresponds to B, N, S, E, NE, or SE).

Similarly, we know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
This means:
- If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is above z. (This corresponds to N, NE, or NW).
- If infy(x) <= supy(z), then x might overlap with z in the y-direction, or be below it. (This corresponds to B, E, W, S, SE, or SW).

I'm going to try and simplify the approach.

Let's define regions in a 2D plane:
- x is located to the left of and above y.
- y is contained within the bounding box of z.

Here's a visual representation:
z's bounding box is the largest, and y is within this box.
x is to the left of and above y.

Given these constraints, what are the possible positions of x in relation to z?

Well, since y is inside z, and x is to the left of and above y, x can be:
1. Inside z (the B relation),
2. To the left of z (the W relation),
3. Above z (the N relation),
4. To the left of and above z (the NW relation),
5. Or any other combination? Let's think about it.

Actually, I'd like to be precise. We're told that y is in relation B to z, which means y is is contained within the bounding box of z (strictly inside).

And x is in relation NW to y, which means supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y), and supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y).

Given the constraints provided:
- x is NW of y, so supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y is B of z, so infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

We know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).

For x to be W, NW, or SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
For x to be in B, N, or S relation with z, we need infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z).
For x to be E, NE, or SE of z, we need supx(z) < supx(x).

But our constraints don't directly relate supx(x) to infx(z), so any of these scenarios could be possible depending on the specific values.

Similarly, for the y-direction, our constraints don't directly relate infy(x) to supy(z), so different relations could be possible.

Hmm, let me try a slightly different approach.

Since the B relation means that region y is strictly contained inside the bounding box of region z, all the coordinates of y are constrained within z's bounds:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z)

And since x is NW of y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

Now, let's derive:
- From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can deduce that supx(x) and infx(z) are unconstrained with respect to each other. x could be to the left of, overlapping with, or to the right of z in the x-direction.
- From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we can deduce that infy(x) and supy(z) are also unconstrained with respect to each other. x could be above, overlapping with, or below z in the y-direction.

Based on these derivations, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE.

Actually, I'm not sure all these relations are possible. Let me draw it out.

The bounding box of z is defined by the lines x=infx(z), x=supx(z), y=infy(z), and y=supy(z).
Region y is inside this box, with coordinates such that infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z).
Region x is NW of y, which means it's to the left and above y. This means supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

The location of x in relation to z can be determined by how supx(x) relates to infx(z) and how infy(x) relates to supy(z).

For the x-coordinate:
- If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the left of z.
- If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z), then x overlaps with z in the x-direction.
- If supx(z) < supx(x), then x extends to the right of z.

From the given constraints, we know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This means that supx(x) - infx(z) <= infx(y) - infx(z) <= 0. So supx(x) - infx(z) <= 0, which means supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, x is to the left of z in the x-direction.

For the y-coordinate:
- If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is completely above z.
- If infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x overlaps with z in the y-direction.
- If infy(x) < infy(z), then x extends below the bottom of z.

From the given constraints, we can't directly determine the relation between infy(x) and supy(z). We know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(z) >= supy(y).

Given the unconstrained relation between infy(x) and supy(z), all three scenarios are possible for the y-coordinate.

Hmm, I think I'm not fully understanding the constraints. Let me revisit.

If y is B of z, it means y is inside the bounding box of z (strictly inside):
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z)

And if x is NW of y, it means x is to the left and above y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

I realized my earlier mistake. I wrote supx(x) - infx(z) <= infx(y) - infx(z) <= 0, but this doesn't make sense because we can't subtract inequalities like that directly.

Let me try again. We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). From these, we can deduce that either supx(x) <= infx(z) or infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y) could hold.

Similarly, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z). From these, we can deduce that infy(x) >= supy(y), but this doesn't give us a clear relation between infy(x) and supy(z).

Given these scenarios, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NW of z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
3. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(x) <= infy(z), then x would be SW of z. But given that supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we have infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) >= infy(z). So, infy(x) >= infy(z), which means x cannot be SW of z.

4. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NW of z, but parts of x might be directly above z.
5. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z, but parts of x might be inside z's bounding box.
6. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(x) <= infy(z), this scenario is not possible, as we demonstrated above.

Actually, wait, that's not right. We know that x is the NW of y, which means that x is to the left of y and above y. That means that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). And we know that y is B of z, which means that infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let me try visualizing this. Region z's bounding box is defined by its extreme points. y is strictly inside this box. Now, x is to the left of and above y. So, the right-most point of x is to the left of the left-most point of y, and the bottom-most point of x is above the top-most point of y.

Given these contraints, let's determine the possible locations of x:

1. x can be to the left of, inside, or to the right of z in the x-direction:
   - If supx(x) <= infx(z), it's to the left of z.
   - If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z), it's inside or overlaps with z in the x-direction.
   - If supx(z) < supx(x), it's to the right of z.

But we know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). These constraints don't give us a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z), so x could be to the left of or inside z in the x-direction. But since x is to the left of y, and y is inside z, x cannot be to the right of z in the x-direction.

2. Similarly, x can be above, inside, or below z in the y-direction:
   - If infy(x) > supy(z), it's above z.
   - If infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), it's inside or overlaps with z in the y-direction.
   - If infy(x) < infy(z), it's below z.

We know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z). These constraints don't give us a direct relation between infy(x) and supy(z) or infy(z). However, since infy(x) >= supy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y), we can deduce that infy(x) > infy(z). This means that x can be above or inside z in the y-direction, but not below it.

Given these considerations, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NW of z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
3. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is N of z.
4. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is in relation B with z.

But wait, I'm not sure if B is possible, because B implies that the entire region x is within the bounds of z. Given that x is to the left of y and y is inside z, can the entire region x be inside z? Let's check.

From the given constraints, we know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z). These constraints don't determine whether supx(x) <= infx(z) or infx(z) < supx(x).

If we were to place regions x, y, and z such that infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z), then parts of region x would be inside the bounds of z in the x-direction. And if we also ensure that infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then parts of region x would be inside the bounds of z in the y-direction.

But for x to be entirely inside z (B relation), we need infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z). Given the constraint supx(x) <= infx(y), I'm not sure if infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) can be satisfied. Let's try to visualize this.

Let's assume:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) (for x to be inside z in the x-direction)
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from the constraint that x is NW of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from the constraint that y is B of z)

Combining the first two inequalities, we get infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y). This means infx(z) <= infx(y), which is consistent with the third inequality.

So, it seems like region x can be inside z in the x-direction.

Similarly, for the y-direction, we have:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z) (for x to be inside z in the y-direction)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from the constraint that x is NW of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z) (from the constraint that y is B of z)

Combining the first two inequalities, we get infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x). Given the third inequality, we know that infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y), so infy(z) < supy(y). Since supy(y) <= infy(x), we get infy(z) < infy(x), which is consistent with the first inequality.

But there's still the question of whether supy(x) <= supy(z) can be satisfied. From the given constraints, we don't have a direct relation between supy(x) and supy(z). So, supy(x) > supy(z) is a possibility, which would mean x is not entirely inside z.

Upon reflection, I don't think the B relation is possible between x and z. If x is to the left of y (supx(x) <= infx(y)) and y is inside z, then at least part of x (the part that's to the left of y) will be outside z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NW of z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
3. If infx(z) < supx(x) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is N of z.

But I just realized the third one might not be possible either. I said:
(3) "If infx(z) < supx(x) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is N of z."

But for x to be N of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z). From the constraint supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), it's not clear if infx(z) <= infx(x) can be satisfied.

Let's try once more. For the third relation (N), we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) (for x to be inside z in the x-direction)
- supy(z) < infy(x) (for x to be above z)

Let's say we have a scenario where infx(z) <= infx(x). If we also want supx(x) <= infx(y) to be satisfied (from the constraint that x is NW of y), then we get infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y). And given the constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y being B of z), these are all consistent.

So, the third relation (N) is also possible.

Let's see if there are any more possible relations.

We established that x can be to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) or overlap with z in the x-direction (infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y)). And in the y-direction, x can be above z (infy(x) > supy(z)) or overlap with z (infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z)).

So, the possible combinations are:
1. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NW of z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
3. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is N of z.
4. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), this could be a different relation.

Let's analyze the fourth case. The conditions state that x overlaps with z in both the x-direction and y-direction. But the question is, can region x be entirely inside z?

I previously made an error. The condition for x to be entirely inside z is:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) (for x to be inside z in the x-direction)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z) (for x to be inside z in the y-direction)

But from the constraint supx(x) <= infx(y) (since x is NW of y) and the knowledge that infx(y) is inside z (so infx(y) > infx(z)), we get supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) > infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) > infx(z). These constraints don't provide a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z).

Actually wait, infx(y) may not be strictly greater than infx(z) since we just know that infx(z) <= infx(y) from "y is B of z".

So, there are two cases to consider for the x-coordinate:
- If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the left of z.
- If infx(z) < supx(x), then supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B of z). These don't give a clear relation between supx(x) and infx(z). But if infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(z).

I'm getting a bit confused. Let's take a different approach. Let me draw a simple visual to understand the constraints better.

Given:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is B of z: infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z)

To determine the possible relations between x and z, I'll analyze the x and y directions separately.

For the x-direction, x can be:
- To the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
- Inside or overlapping with z: infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z)
- To the right of z: supx(z) < supx(x)

Given the constraints, the third option (to the right of z) is not possible. This is because supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y) and infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is inside z). This means supx(x) < supx(z), eliminating the possibility of x being to the right of z.

For the y-direction, x can be:
- Above z: infy(x) > supy(z)
- Inside or overlapping with z: infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z)
- Below z: infy(x) < infy(z)

Given the constraints, the third option (below z) is not possible. This is because supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) (y is inside z). This means infy(z) < infy(x), eliminating the possibility of x being below z.

The remaining combinations are:
1. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NW of z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
3. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is N of z.
4. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), x could be inside or overlapping with z.

For the fourth combination, to determine if x can be entirely inside z (the B relation), we'd need to check if both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) can be satisfied.

From the constraints, we know that supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is inside z). These don't give us a direct relation between infx(x) and infx(z). It's possible for infx(x) to be less than infx(z) (x is to the left of z) or for infx(x) to be greater than or equal to infx(z) (x is inside z, like y, or overlapping with it).

Similarly, for the y-direction, we know that supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is inside z). These don't give us a direct relation between supy(x) and supy(z). It's possible for supy(x) to be greater than supy(z) (x is above z) or for supy(x) to be less than or equal to supy(z) (x is inside z, like y, or overlapping with it).

So the B relation can't be ruled out based on the given constraints.

Hmm, I realize I'm a bit confused by the definitions of the cardinal directions as given in the problem.

Let's revisit the definition of NW. If we say "a NW b", then:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is to the left of b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is above b)

And for the B relation, if we say "a B b", then:
- infx(b) <= infx(a) (a's left edge is to the right of or at the same position as b's left edge)
- supx(a) <= supx(b) (a's right edge is to the left of or at the same position as b's right edge)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) (a's bottom is above or at the same position as b's bottom)
- supy(a) <= supy(b) (a's top is below or at the same position as b's top)

In other words, a is within the bounding box of b.

Now, we're given:
- x NW y, which means supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y B z, which means infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

We can try to visualize this:
- z's bounding box is defined by the points (infx(z), infy(z)) and (supx(z), supy(z)).
- y's bounding box is defined by the points (infx(y), infy(y)) and (supx(y), supy(y)), and it's inside (completely or partially) z's bounding box.
- x's bounding box is defined by the points (infx(x), infy(x)) and (supx(x), supy(x)), and it's to the left of and above y's bounding box.

Given these constraints, what's the relationship between x and z?

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
For x to be N of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z).
For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z).
For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z).
For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(x) < infy(z).
For x to be S of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(x) < infy(z).
For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(x) < infy(z).

Now, let's check which of these relations are consistent with our constraints.

From the constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at the same position as z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at the same position as z's right edge)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom is above or at the same position as z's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is below or at the same position as z's top)

The constraints don't give us a direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).
We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but these don't determine the relation between supx(x) and infx(z).

Similarly, for the y-coordinate, we don't have a direct relation between infy(x) and supy(z).
We have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), but these don't determine the relation between infy(x) and supy(z).

Given these, we need to consider the possible scenarios:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the left of z.
2. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z), then x overlaps with or is inside z in the x-direction.
3. If supx(z) < supx(x), then x is to the right of z or overlaps with it in such a way that part of x is to the right of z.

Similarly, for the y-coordinate:
1. If supy(z) < infy(x), then x is above z.
2. If infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x overlaps with or is inside z in the y-direction.
3. If infy(x) < infy(z), then x is below z or overlaps with it in such a way that part of x is below z.

Now, let's analyze if any of these scenarios can be ruled out based on the given constraints.

For the x-coordinate:
From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) (x is to the left of y and y has a non-zero width), we get supx(x) < supx(y). From supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at the same position as z's right edge), we get supx(y) <= supx(z). Combining these, we get supx(x) < supx(z). This rules out the scenario where x is entirely to the right of z.

For the y-coordinate:
From supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(y) <= supy(y) (x is above y and y has a non-zero height), we get infy(y) < infy(x). From infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom is above or at the same position as z's bottom), we get infy(z) <= infy(y). Combining these, we get infy(z) < infy(x). This rules out the scenario where x is entirely below z.

Given these constraints, the possible combinations are:
1. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) < infy(x), then x is NW of z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
3. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) < infy(x), then x is N of z.
4. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is potentially in the B relation with z. But we'd need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) can be satisfied.
5. If supx(z) < supx(x) and supy(z) < infy(x), then x is NE of z.
6. If supx(z) < supx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.

Wait. I'm not sure if the 5 and 6 are possible, because we had concluded that supx(x) < supx(z), which means that x can't be entirely to the right of z (the NE or E relations). Let me double-check.

From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= supx(y), we get supx(x) <= supx(y). From supx(y) <= supx(z), we get supx(y) <= supx(z). Combining these, we get supx(x) <= supx(z). Now, for the E and NE relations, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). But since supx(x) <= supx(z), the only solution is supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x), which is possible only if x is a vertical line (which doesn't satisfy our region definition). So, the E and NE relations seem unlikely.

Let's take a step back and be more precise.

From the constraints:
1. For "x NW y", we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
2. For "y B z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

For the x-direction:
From (1), supx(x) <= infx(y) tells us that x is to the left of y. Now, for the relation between x and z, we have:
- If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the left of z.
- If infx(z) < supx(x), given the constraint supx(x) <= infx(y), we can check if infx(z) < infx(y). From (2), we have infx(z) <= infx(y). So, it's possible to have infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y).

For the y-direction:
From (1), supy(y) <= infy(x) tells us that x is above y. Now, for the relation between x and z, we have:
- If supy(z) < infy(x), then x is above z.
- If infy(x) <= supy(z), given the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x), we can check if supy(y) <= supy(z). From (2), we have supy(y) <= supy(z). So, it's possible to have supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(z).

Combining the possibilities for the x-direction and y-direction, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) < infy(x), then x is NW of z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) < infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
3. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(z) < infy(x), then x is N of z.
4. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(z) < infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is overlapping with z, potentially in a more complex relation.

Now we need to check if relation B (x inside the bounding box of z) is consistent with the constraints.

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is inside z in the x-direction)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is inside z in the y-direction)

The constraints tell us that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). If infx(z) < infx(y), we'd have infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y), which would place x partly inside z in the x-direction (given infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x)). But if infx(z) = infx(y), we'd have supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z, not inside it. Given the uncertainty in the exact values, the B relation is a possible, but only if infx(z) < infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(x).

Similarly, for the y-direction, the constraints tell us that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). If supy(y) < supy(z), we'd have supy(y) < infy(x) <= supy(z), which would place x partly inside z in the y-direction (given infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z)). But if supy(y) = supy(z), we'd have supy(z) = supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above z, not inside it. Given the uncertainty in the exact values, the B relation is a possible, but only if supy(y) < supy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

So, the B relation is technically possible, but it requires specific conditions to be met.

Actually, wait, case 4 needs to be revised. We said:
(4) "If infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(z) < infy(x) <= supy(z), then x is overlapping with z, potentially in a more complex relation."

For the B relation, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), which doesn't contradict our conditions (only that supx(x) <= infx(y)). And the y-direction conditions are also compatible. So, the B relation is indeed possible.

Let's restate the possible relations between x and z:
1. NW: If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) < infy(x).
2. W: If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) < infy(x) <= supy(z).
3. N: If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) < infy(x).
4. B: If infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z).

Actually, I think I can simply all of this.
We have:
1. For "x NW y", we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
2. For "y B z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let's visualize the regions a bit differently. I denote the coordinates of the bounding box of region a:
a: (infx(a), infy(a)) - bottom-left corner
   (supx(a), supy(a)) - top-right corner

With this notation, the constraints become:
1. For "x NW y", the top-right corner of x is to the left and below the bottom-left corner of y.
2. For "y B z", the bottom-left corner of y is within the z, and the top-right corner of y is within the z.

Now, let's consider the possible positions of the bounding box of x in relation to the bounding box of z.

The left side of the bounding box of x is at infx(x), which can be:
a. infx(x) < infx(z) (x's left side is to the left of z's left side)
b. infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) (x's left side is between z's left and right sides)
c. supx(z) < infx(x) (x's left side is to the right of z's right side)

The right side of the bounding box of x is at supx(x), which can be:
d. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x's right side is to the left of z's left side)
e. infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right side is between z's left and right sides)
f. supx(z) < supx(x) (x's right side is to the right of z's right side)

The bottom side of the bounding box of x is at infy(x), which can be:
g. infy(x) < infy(z) (x's bottom side is below z's bottom side)
h. infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z) (x's bottom side is between z's bottom and top sides)
i. supy(z) < infy(x) (x's bottom side is above z's top side)

The top side of the bounding box of x is at supy(x), which can be:
j. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x's top side is below z's bottom side)
k. infy(z) < supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top side is between z's bottom and top sides)
l. supy(z) < supy(x) (x's top side is above z's top side)

Now, the constraints provide us with some information. 

From "x NW y", we know that:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x's right side is to the left of y's left side)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (y's top side is below x's bottom side)

And from "y B z", we know that:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's bounding box is within z in the x-direction)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's bounding box is within z in the y-direction)

Using these constraints, let's see if we can eliminate any of the scenarios above:

From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we conclude that the left side of y is to the right of the right side of x, and the left side of z is to the left of the left side of y. This doesn't directly give us the relation between the right side of x and the left side of z. However, if we consider a specific scenario where infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(z), which means case "d" is possible (x's right side is to the left of z's left side).

But for a general case, the right side of x can be to the left of the left side of z (case "d"), or the right side of x can be between the left and right sides of z (case "e"). 

However, given the constraints, it's not possible for the right side of x to be to the right of the right side of z (case "f"). This is because we know that the right side of x is to the left of the left side of y (from supx(x) <= infx(y)), and the right side of y is to the left of the right side of z (from supx(y) <= supx(z)). This means the right side of x is to the left of the right side of z (supx(x) < supx(z)).

Similarly, for the y-direction, from supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we conclude that the top of y is below the bottom of x, and the top of y is below the top of z. This doesn't give us a direct relation between the bottom of x and the top of z. However, if we consider a specific scenario where supy(y) = supy(z), then supy(z) <= infy(x), which means case "i" is possible (x's bottom side is above z's top side).

But for a general case, the bottom of x can be above the top of z (case "i"), or the bottom of x can be between the bottom and top of z (case "h"). 

Given the constraints, it's not possible for the bottom of x to be below the bottom of z (case "g"). This is because we know that the bottom of x is above the top of y (from supy(y) <= infy(x)), and the bottom of y is above or at the same level as the bottom of z (from infy(z) <= infy(y)). This means the bottom of x is above the bottom of z (infy(z) < infy(x)).

Similarly, the top of x can be between the bottom and top of z (case "k"), or the top of x can be above the top of z (case "l"). It's not possible for the top of x to be below the bottom of z (case "j").

Combining the possible scenarios for the horizontal and vertical directions, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. NW: Right side of x is to the left of left side of z, and bottom side of x is above top side of z. (combinations of cases "d" and "i")
2. W: Right side of x is to the left of left side of z, and x and z overlap in the y-direction. (combinations of cases "d" and "h", "d" and "k")
3. N: X and z overlap in the x-direction, and bottom side of x is above top side of z. (combinations of cases "b" and "i", "e" and "i")
4. B: X is completely inside z. (combinations of cases "b" and "h", "b" and "k", "e" and "h", "e" and "k")

So, the possible relations are:
1. NW (North West): x is to the left and above z.
2. W (West): x is to the left of z, and they overlap in the y-direction.
3. N (North): x is above z, and they overlap in the x-direction.
4. B (Bounding Box): x is contained within the bounding box of z.

Actually, I think there are still some issues with my analysis. Let's directly analyze the possible relations using the definitions. For this, I need to compare the coordinates of x and z.

For the NW relation (x is North West of z), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

For the W relation (x is West of z), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z) (x overlaps with z in the y-direction)

For the N relation (x is North of z), we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) (x overlaps with z in the x-direction)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

For the B relation (x is inside the bounding box of z), we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is inside z in the x-direction)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is inside z in the y-direction)

Now, let's analyze the constraints once more.

From "x NW y", we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x's right side is to the left of y's left side)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (y's top side is below x's bottom side)

From "y B z", we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's bounding box is within z in the x-direction)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's bounding box is within z in the y-direction)

For the NW relation between x and z, we need to determine if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) can be satisfied.

We know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). If infx(z) < infx(y), we don't have a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z). But if infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(z), which satisfies the first condition for the NW relation.

Similarly, we know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). If supy(y) < supy(z), we don't have a direct relation between infy(x) and supy(z). But if supy(y) = supy(z), then supy(z) <= infy(x), which satisfies the second condition for the NW relation.

So, the NW relation is a possibility. So is W, N, and B.

The B relation is consistent with the constraints if:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (constraint is silent on this, so it's possible)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (given supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z), this is satisfied)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (given infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), this is satisfied)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (constraint is silent on this, so it's possible)

So, all the four relations (NW, W, N, B) are possible, and the answer is: NW, W, N, B.

Actually, I realized I'm getting confused by some of the relations. Let me just represent the constraints using intervals.

For simplicity, let's denote the intervals as [a, b] for the x-coordinate range and [c, d] for the y-coordinate range. With this notation, the constraints for the "NW" and "B" relations simplify to:

For "x NW y", we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x's x-interval [infx(x), supx(x)] is to the left of y's x-interval [infx(y), supx(y)])
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (y's y-interval [infy(y), supy(y)] is below x's y-interval [infy(x), supy(x)])

For "y B z", we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-interval [infx(y), supx(y)] is inside z's x-interval [infx(z), supx(z)])
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's y-interval [infy(y), supy(y)] is inside z's y-interval [infy(z), supy(z)])

Let's denote the regions as follows:
x: ([infx(x), supx(x)], [infy(x), supy(x)])
y: ([infx(y), supx(y)], [infy(y), supy(y)])
z: ([infx(z), supx(z)], [infy(z), supy(z)])

The constraints are:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (x NW y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z) (y B z)

Let's determine the possible relations between x and z. I'm going to list every possible relation and check if it's possible given the constraints, and also provide counter-examples for the ones that are not possible.

For the SW relation (x is South West of z), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

But from the constraints, we know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This gives us infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z). So, the SW relation is not possible.

For the S relation (x is South of z), we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is inside z in the x-direction)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

Once again, this contradicts the constraints for the same reason as the SW relation.

For the SE relation (x is South East of z), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

This contradicts the constraints for the y-coordinate as in the SW and S relations. Additionally, from the constraints, we know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z). This gives us supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) < infx(x), which is a contradiction. So, the SE relation is not possible.

For the E relation (x is East of z), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
