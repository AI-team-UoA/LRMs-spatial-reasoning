PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have:
- Region x is B of region y, which means x is in the bounding box of y.
- Region y is W of region z, which means y is to the west of z.

Now we need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions:

x B y if and only if:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means x is inside the bounding box of y.

y W z if and only if:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means y is to the west of z.

Now, let's think about the constraints on x and z:

Given that x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

And y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

What can we infer about the relationship between x and z?

From x B y, we know supx(x) <= supx(y).
From y W z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z).

Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z), which is a necessary condition for x being to the west of z (i.e., x W z, x NW z, or x SW z).

But what about the y-coordinates?

From x B y, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y W z, we know:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(z), which is a necessary condition for x being to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the bottom of x is above or at the bottom of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(z), which means the top of x is below or at the top of z.

These constraints suggest x is somewhere to the west of z, but the exact cardinal direction (W, NW, SW) depends on the specific position of x relative to z in the y-coordinate.

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. If infy(x) >= supy(z), then x would be NW of z.
2. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x would be SW of z.
3. If infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) > infy(z), then x would be W of z.

Wait, I made a mistake. If x is B of y, then x is inside the bounding box of y, not the other way around.

Let me reconsider:

x B y if and only if:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

If x is B of y, and y is W of z, then:

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
  So, supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
  So, infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
  So, supy(x) <= supy(z)

These constraints indicate that:
- x is to the west of z (since supx(x) <= infx(z))
- The bottom of x is above or at the bottom of z (since infy(z) <= infy(x))
- The top of x is below or at the top of z (since supy(x) <= supy(z))

Depending on the specific positions, x could be:
- W of z (if infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z))
- NW of z (if supy(z) <= infy(x))
- SW of z (if supy(x) <= infy(z))

But wait, let's think through the definitions more carefully:

- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y W z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x B y)
So, infy(z) <= infy(x). This doesn't constrain whether x is N, middle, or S of z.

- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y W z)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x B y)
So, supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, this doesn't constrain whether x is N, middle, or S of z.

Actually, I think I was correct. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is strictly to the west of z. The y-coordinate relationship between x and z determines whether x is NW, W, or SW of z.

But I think the error I made is that we can't really determine the y-coordinate relationship based on the given constraints, because the constraints on the y-coordinates (infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)) don't precisely tell us whether x is entirely above, entirely below, or overlapping with z in the y-coordinate.

Let's consider the possibilities again:

1. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is strictly to the north of z, which combined with being to the west would make x NW of z.
2. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is strictly to the south of z, which combined with being to the west would make x SW of z.
3. If the above two conditions don't hold (i.e., if infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(z)), then x overlaps with z in the y-coordinate, which combined with being to the west would make x W of z.

But here's the issue. We have:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y W z and x B y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from x B y and y W z)

These constraints don't tell us whether infy(x) > supy(z) or supy(x) < infy(z). So, we can't determine whether x is NW, W, or SW of z based on the given constraints.

However, we can say with certainty that x is to the west of z (since supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)).

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, and SW. We can't narrow it down further based on the constraints given.

Wait, let me make sure of this: The definition of W says that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means that the y-coordinate of y is contained within the y-coordinate of z.

Given that x B y, the y-coordinate of x is also contained within the y-coordinate of y.

So, the y-coordinate of x is contained within the y-coordinate of z.

This would suggest that x W z is the most likely relation. However, we can't rule out NW or SW without more information, because we don't know the exact positions of the regions.

Let's try to visualize the constraints and see if that helps.

If x B y, then x is inside the bounding box of y.
If y W z, then y is to the west of z, and the y-coordinate of y is contained within the y-coordinate of z.

Given these, it's possible that:
1. x is W of z (if the y-coordinate of x overlaps with the y-coordinate of z).
2. x is NW of z (if the bottom of x is above the top of z).
3. x is SW of z (if the top of x is below the bottom of z).

However, the latter two cases seem problematic given the constraint that the y-coordinate of y is contained within the y-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is contained within the y-coordinate of y. So, I believe the most consistent relation is x W z.

Actually, wait. If x B y, then the definition says:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means that x is inside the bounding box of y, but not necessarily that the y-coordinate of x is contained within the y-coordinate of y. For example, it's possible that infy(x) > infy(y) and supy(x) < supy(y).

So, I think we need to be more careful about the constraints:

From x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, let's consider the cases:

1. If infy(x) = infy(z) and supy(x) = supy(z), then x would be W of z.
2. If infy(x) > infy(z) and supy(x) < supy(z), then x would still be W of z.
3. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x would be NW of z.
4. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x would be SW of z.

Wait, I think I'm still making an error in my reasoning. If infy(z) <= infy(x), it doesn't rule out the possibility that x is above z. It just means the bottom of x is above or at the bottom of z.

Similarly, if supy(x) <= supy(z), it doesn't rule out the possibility that x is below z. It just means the top of x is below or at the top of z.

Actually, let me re-examine the constraints step by step. Remember the definitions:

1. x B y if and only if:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. y W z if and only if:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z)

From (1), we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From (2), we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining, we get:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z). This means the top of x is at or below the top of z.

Given these constraints, x could be:
- W of z if its y-coordinate overlaps with the y-coordinate of z (meaning, it's not entirely above or below z).
- NW of z if it's entirely above z (meaning, infy(x) > supy(z)).
- SW of z if it's entirely below z (meaning, supy(x) < infy(z)).

Now, the constraints infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) don't tell us whether x is entirely above, entirely below, or overlapping with z in the y-coordinate. Thus, all three possibilities (W, NW, SW) are valid.

I think NW and SW are still possible because the constraints don't rule out the possibility that infy(x) > supy(z) or supy(x) < infy(z). They only tell us that the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z and the top of x is at or below the top of z.

So, the final answer would be that the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, and SW.

Let me draw it out to make sure:

1. Constraints:
   - Region x is B of region y
   - Region y is W of region z

2. What this means:
   - x is in the bounding box of y
   - y is to the west of z, with its y-coordinates contained within those of z.

3. From these, we know:
   - x is to the west of z (since it's in the bounding box of y, which is to the west of z).
   - The y-coordinate relationship between x and z depends on the exact positions. Without more constraints, x could be NW, W, or SW of z.

So, the possible relations are NW, W, and SW.

Wait, actually I misunderstood the constraint earlier.

x B y if and only if:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means x is *inside* the bounding box of y, not the other way around. So, x is contained within y's bounding box.

But wait, B is the 'bounding box' relation. It should mean that x is contained within the bounding box. Let me re-read the definition.

From the definition: a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, if x B y, then infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).

This means x is inside the bounding box of y.

Now, if y W z, then supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z). This means the top of x is at or below the top of z.

So, x is to the west of z, and its y-coordinates are constrained by infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Based on the definition, if a is a region, infy(a) is the lower bound (minimum) of the y values of the region, and supy(a) is the upper bound (maximum) of the y values of the region.

Given these, we can say:
- x is definitely to the west of z.
- The bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z.
- The top of x is at or below the top of z.

But this doesn't specify the exact cardinal direction. We need to compare infy(x) with supy(z) and supy(x) with infy(z) to determine the exact direction:

1. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is above z, making x NW of z.
2. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is below z, making x SW of z.
3. If the above two conditions don't hold, which means infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(z), then x and z overlap in the y-coordinate, making x W of z.

But the given constraints don't specify the exact values of infy(x), supy(x), infy(z), or supy(z). They only provide the inequalities I mentioned. Therefore, we can't determine whether conditions 1 or 2 above hold.

Hence, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, and SW.

But wait, if infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), doesn't that contradict (or make it impossible) that x is NW of z? We can't have infy(x) > supy(z) if infy(z) <= infy(x), because that would mean infy(z) <= infy(x) > supy(z), which would imply infy(z) > supy(z), which doesn't make sense for a valid region. So NW doesn't seem possible.

Actually, I'm confusing myself. infy(z) <= infy(x) just means the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z. It doesn't specify where the top of z (supy(z)) is in relation to the bottom of x (infy(x)). infy(z) can be less than or equal to infy(x), and at the same time, supy(z) can be less than infy(x).

So I think NW, W, SW are all possible, but I will make a more careful analysis.

1. x B y means x is inside the bounding box of y. Formally:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. y W z means y is to the west of z, with the y-coordinates of y within the y-coordinates of z. Formally:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we have:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z). This means the top of x is at or below the top of z.

To determine the exact cardinal direction (NW, W, or SW), we need to know the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z), as well as between supy(x) and infy(z):

1. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NW of z.
2. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is SW of z.
3. If infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(z), then x is W of z.

Let's check if our constraints allow for NW:
- We have infy(z) <= infy(x). This doesn't rule out infy(x) > supy(z), as long as infy(z) <= supy(z), which is true for a valid region.

Let's check if our constraints allow for SW:
- We have supy(x) <= supy(z). This doesn't rule out supy(x) < infy(z), as long as infy(z) <= supy(z), which is true for a valid region.

So, both NW and SW are still possible based on our constraints. And of course, W is also possible.

Let me try to be more analytical.

the constraints we have are:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is at or below the top of z)

For x to be NW of z, we'd need infy(x) > supy(z), which means the bottom of x is above the top of z. This is compatible with infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z).

For x to be SW of z, we'd need supy(x) < infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z. But we also have the constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z). If these both hold, then infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) < infy(z), which is a contradiction. So, x cannot be SW of z.

Wait, that can't be correct. If x is SW of z, then supy(x) < infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x). That would mean supy(x) < infy(z) <= infy(x), which suggests the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is a contradiction.

So, it seems like SW is not a possible relation.

Let's check for NW again. For x to be NW of z, we need infy(x) > supy(z). We also have the constraint supy(x) <= supy(z). If these both hold, then infy(x) > supy(z) >= supy(x), which suggests the bottom of x is above the top of x, another contradiction.

So, it seems like NW is also not a possible relation.

That leaves W as the only possible relation between x and z.

Actually, I think I made an error. Let's reconsider the constraints:

1. x B y means x is inside the bounding box of y. Formally:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. y W z means y is to the west of z, with the y-coordinates of y within the y-coordinates of z. Formally:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we have:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z). This means the top of x is at or below the top of z.

For x to be NW of z, we'd need infy(x) > supy(z). But we also have the constraint supy(x) <= supy(z). If both hold, then infy(x) > supy(z) >= supy(x), which suggests the bottom of x is above the top of x, which is a contradiction. So, x cannot be NW of z.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need supy(x) < infy(z). But we also have the constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). If both hold, then supy(x) < infy(z) <= infy(x), which suggests the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is a contradiction. So, x cannot be SW of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is W.

But wait, I'm getting confused.

Here are the definitions again:

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

For x NW z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (this is not guaranteed by our constraints, as we only know infy(z) <= infy(x), not supy(z) <= infy(x))

For x W z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we have)

For x SW z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (this is not guaranteed by our constraints, as we only know supy(x) <= supy(z), not supy(x) <= infy(z))

So, based on our current constraints:
- For x to be NW of z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x), which isn't guaranteed.
- For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), which we have.
- For x to be SW of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z), which isn't guaranteed.

Therefore, the only relation we can guarantee is W.

But, what I need to be even more careful about is: are the other relations (NW, SW) impossible, or are they just not guaranteed?

Let's check if they are possible. For NW, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). Our constraints say infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), but they don't tell us where supy(z) lies relative to infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x) (making x NW of z), but it's also possible that supy(z) > infy(x) (making x not NW of z).

Similarly, for SW, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). Our constraints say infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), but they don't tell us where supy(x) lies relative to infy(z). It's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z) (making x SW of z), but it's also possible that supy(x) > infy(z) (making x not SW of z).

Wait, if supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(x), which means the top of x is below the bottom of x. This is a contradiction, so x cannot be SW of z.

Similarly, if supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(x), another contradiction. So, x cannot be NW of z either.

So, the only possible relation is W.

Actually, I'm making an error in my deductions.  Let's restart and be very careful.

Let's formalize the constraints: we know
- x B y, which means infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y W z, which means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

If we want to determine the relationship between x and z, we need to compare their bounding boxes.

For the x-coordinates: We have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z). This indicates x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinates: We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x). We also have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now, for the relation between x and z to be:
- NW: We'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- W: We'd need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- SW: We'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We already have supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). These constraints definitely satisfy the conditions for x W z. But we need to check if they also allow for NW or SW.

For x to be NW of z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). We have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), but this doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). Without knowing their relative positions, we can't rule out the possibility that supy(z) <= infy(x). Hence, NW is a possibility, but not a certainty.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). We have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), but this doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). Without knowing their relative positions, we can't rule out the possibility that supy(x) <= infy(z). Hence, SW is also a possibility, but not a certainty.

Hmm, wait, can I rule these out? Let's think more carefully.

For x to be NW of z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). We have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The question is, can supy(z) <= infy(x) also be true?

If so, then we'd have: supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This means the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is a contradiction for a well-defined region. So, NW is not a possible relation.

Similarly, for x to be SW of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). We have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The question is, can supy(x) <= infy(z) also be true?

If so, then we'd have: supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). Again, this means the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is a contradiction. So, SW is not a possible relation either.

So, the only possible relation between region x and region z is W.

Let me re-examine the definitions one more time:

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Now let's check if NW and SW are possible. For NW, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). Our constraints say infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). 

If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then it's implied that infy(z) <= supy(z) (a valid region) and infy(x) <= supy(x) (a valid region), so there's no contradiction. This means NW is a possibility, but it's not guaranteed based on our constraints.

For SW, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). Our constraints say infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). 

If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts the fact that infy(x) <= supy(x) for a valid region. So, SW is not a possible relation.

Alright, now I'll re-examine NW more carefully. For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

We have the constraints:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).

For x to be NW of z, we'd also need supy(z) <= infy(x). Having both supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) doesn't lead to a direct contradiction. It's possible that supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). But then, this would mean supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts the definition of a valid region.

So, NW is also not a possible relation.

Thus, the only possible relation between region x and region z is W.

Oh wait, let's reread the definition of B. It says that a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b). So if x B y, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

Which means x is inside the bounding box of y. I think I had this correct earlier. And if y W z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these constraints, we get:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z). This means the top of x is at or below the top of z.

Let's see if these are sufficient to guarantee a specific cardinal direction.

For W, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), which are all satisfied. So W is definitely a possible relation.

For NW, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first is satisfied, but for the second, our constraints don't tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). So, we can't determine if NW is a possibility.

For SW, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first is satisfied, but for the second, our constraints don't tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, we can't determine if SW is a possibility either.

Now, let's check if NW leads to a contradiction. Suppose x is NW of z. Then, supy(z) <= infy(x). We also have the constraint supy(x) <= supy(z). Combining, we get supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This means the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is a contradiction for a valid region.

Similarly, suppose x is SW of z. Then, supy(x) <= infy(z). We also have the constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). Combining, we get supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). Again, this means the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is a contradiction.

So, neither NW nor SW is possible. The only possible relation between region x and region z is W.

Actually, there's a possibility that my understanding of the definition of B is incorrect. Let me reread it.

It says: a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

So, if x B y, it means infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).

In other words, the bounding box of y contains the bounding box of x.

This was indeed my understanding earlier. So I think my analysis that the only possible relation is W is correct.

Just to be certain, I'll analyze the problem again. We know:
- x B y, which means infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y W z, which means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

For the relation between x and z, we can combine these constraints:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z).

Based on the definitions of the cardinal directions:
- For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), which are all satisfied.
- For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is satisfied, but the second one would result in supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the definition of a valid region.
- For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition is satisfied, but the second one, combined with infy(z) <= infy(x), would result in supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), which again contradicts the definition of a valid region.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is W.

Let me verify one more time. For a well-defined region a, it's always the case that infy(a) <= supy(a) (the bottom is below the top) and infx(a) <= supx(a) (the left is to the left of the right).

For x to be NW of z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). Combined with our constraint supy(x) <= supy(z), we'd have supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement for a well-defined region (where the bottom should be below the top).

Similarly, for x to be SW of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). Combined with our constraint infy(z) <= infy(x), we'd have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). Again, this implies supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts the definition of a well-defined region.

So, indeed, the only possible relation between x and z is W.

Let's double-check by thinking about the spatial arrangements. We know:
- Region x is inside the bounding box of Region y.
- Region y is to the west of Region z, with y's y-coordinates contained within z's y-coordinates.

Given these, Region x is to the west of Region z. The y-coordinates of Region x are constrained such that its bottom is at or above the bottom of Region z, and its top is at or below the top of Region z. This precisely describes the W relation.

So, the answer is W.

Actually let me just make sure one last time.

We've been given the following information:
1. Region x is B of region y
2. Region y is W of region z

From the definitions:
- x B y means the bounding box of y contains x, specifically: infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y W z means y is to the west of z, with its y-coordinates contained within those of z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's check if these constraints allow for different cardinal directions:

For W: We need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), which are all satisfied. So, W is a possibility.

For NW: We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first is satisfied, but the second, combined with supy(x) <= supy(z), would give us supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This means the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is a contradiction for a valid region. So, NW is not possible.

For SW: We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first is satisfied, but the second, combined with infy(z) <= infy(x), would give us supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). Again, this means the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is a contradiction. So, SW is not possible either.

For the N, NE, E, SE, S, and B cardinal directions, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (since infx(x) <= supx(x) for a valid region). So, these are not possible.

Therefore, the only possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is W.

But I just realized that I've been double-checking the same reasoning over and over again. I'm now confident that the correct answer is W.

Actually, let me re-examine the constraints again. We have:
- x B y, which means infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y W z, which means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z).

Given the definition of the W relation: a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

When applied to x and z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've shown is true)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've shown is true)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we've shown is true)

Since all three conditions for the W relation between x and z are met, we can confidently say that the relation between x and z is W.

Just to be thorough, I'll check one more time if NW or SW are possible.

For NW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've already shown that supx(x) <= infx(z) is true based on our constraints. But for supy(z) <= infy(x), we'd need to combine it with our constraint supy(x) <= supy(z). This would give us supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). For a valid region x, we always have infy(x) <= supy(x). So, this would imply infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(x), which is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x). But this would make region x a line segment in the y-coordinate, which doesn't match the definition of a region in REG (which should be homeomorphic to a closed unit disk). Thus, NW is not a possible relation.

Similarly, for SW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've already shown that supx(x) <= infx(z) is true based on our constraints. But for supy(x) <= infy(z), we'd need to combine it with our constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). This would give us supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). For a valid region x, we always have infy(x) <= supy(x). So, this would imply supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts the definition of a valid region. Thus, SW is not a possible relation either.

I double triple checked and I'm confident that the answer is W.

Actually, I was just thinking: in the problem statement, it's asking about all *possible* relations between region x and region z. So far, I've been focusing on the constraints and determining which relations can be guaranteed based on those constraints. But the constraints only provide bounds, not exact values.

Let's think about it differently. Given the constraints, what are the possible arrangements of the bounding boxes of x and z? 

x B y means x is inside the bounding box of y.
y W z means y is to the west of z, with its y-coordinates contained within those of z.

Given these, x is to the west of z. The y-coordinates of x are constrained such that its bottom is at or above the bottom of z, and its top is at or below the top of z.

This arrangement aligns with the W relation. But, could there be any arrangements that align with other cardinal directions?

Let's check each possible cardinal direction:

1. B: This would mean x is inside the bounding box of z. But since x is inside the bounding box of y, which is to the west of z, x is also to the west of z and can't be inside the bounding box of z. So, B is not possible.

2. S: This would mean x is to the south of z. But since the y-coordinates of x are constrained such that its bottom is at or above the bottom of z, x can't be entirely below z. So, S is not possible.

3. SW: This would mean x is to the southwest of z. Given the constraints, this would imply supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x). Together, these give supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts the definition of a valid region. So, SW is not possible.

4. W: This would mean x is to the west of z, with its y-coordinates contained within those of z. This is precisely what our constraints guarantee. So, W is possible.

5. NW: This would mean x is to the northwest of z. Given the constraints, this would imply supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Together, these give supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts the definition of a valid region. So, NW is not possible.

6. N: This would mean x is to the north of z. But since the y-coordinates of x are constrained such that its top is at or below the top of z, x can't be entirely above z. So, N is not possible.

7. NE: This would mean x is to the northeast of z. But since x is inside the bounding box of y, which is to the west of z, x is also to the west of z and can't be to the east of z. So, NE is not possible.

8. E: This would mean x is to the east of z. But since x is inside the bounding box of y, which is to the west of z, x is also to the west of z and can't be to the east of z. So, E is not possible.

9. SE: This would mean x is to the southeast of z. But since x is inside the bounding box of y, which is to the west of z, x is also to the west of z and can't be to the east of z. So, SE is not possible.

So, the only possible relation between region x and region z is W.

I think I've exhaustively analyzed the problem and I'm 99% confident that the answer is W, but I get stuck on the worry that I might be incorrect.

Okay, one last check: I keep deriving that NW is not possible because supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) would imply that supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts the definition of a valid region. But wait, is it guaranteed that supy(z) <= infy(x) for the NW relation?

Let's re-read the definition: a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

For x NW z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is satisfied based on our constraints. The second condition, combined with our constraint supy(x) <= supy(z), would give us supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). For a valid region x, we always have infy(x) <= supy(x). So, this would imply infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(x), which is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x). But as I mentioned earlier, this would make region x a line segment in the y-coordinate, which doesn't align with the definition of a region in REG. So, NW is not a possible relation.

Actually, I think I derived the correct answer. Under the constraints given, the only possible relation between region x and region z is W: West.

ANSWER:

The question is asking for all possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given the constraints:

1. Region x is B (bounding box) of region y
2. Region y is W (West) of region z

First, let's analyze what these constraints tell us:

x B y means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

y W z means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

These three conditions exactly satisfy the definition of the W relation: x W z if and only if:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Let me verify if other relations are possible:

For SW: Would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we know infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(x), contradicting the definition of a valid region.

For NW: Would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we know supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(x), again contradicting the definition of a valid region.

The answer is: W
