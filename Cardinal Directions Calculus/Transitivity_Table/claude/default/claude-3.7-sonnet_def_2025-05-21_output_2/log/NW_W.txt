PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is W of region z

Let's analyze these conditions:

1. x NW y means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y W z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-extent is contained within z's y-extent)

Now, I need to derive the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze this based on the x and y coordinates:

For the x-coordinate:
- From x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- By transitivity: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- This means: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- Conclusion: x is definitely to the west of z

For the y-coordinate:
- From x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
- From these constraints, we know: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This tells us that x is to the north of y, and y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent.

However, we can't definitely determine the vertical relationship between x and z without more information. Based on the constraints, we have several possibilities:

1. x could be completely to the north of z (infy(x) ≥ supy(z))
2. x could partially overlap with z vertically
3. x could be completely contained within z's vertical extent

So the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- NW (if x is to the north of z)
- W (if x's vertical extent overlaps with z's vertical extent)

Let me double-check by considering specific examples for each case:

Case 1: x NW z
Let's say:
- z is at (5,5) with size 2×2
- y is at (2,5) with size 2×2 (putting it W of z)
- x is at (0,8) with size 1×1 (putting it NW of y and NW of z)

Case 2: x W z
Let's say:
- z is at (5,5) with size 2×2
- y is at (2,5) with size 2×2 (putting it W of z)
- x is at (0,6) with size 1×1 (putting it NW of y but W of z)

Actually, let me verify these examples more carefully to make sure they satisfy our constraints:

Example 1 (x NW z):
- z: infx(z)=5, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=5, supy(z)=7
- y: infx(y)=2, supx(y)=4, infy(y)=5, supy(y)=7
- x: infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=8, supy(x)=9

Checking x NW y:
- supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(y)=2 ✓
- supy(y)=7 ≤ infy(x)=8 ✓

Checking y W z:
- supx(y)=4 ≤ infx(z)=5 ✓
- infy(z)=5 ≤ infy(y)=5 ✓
- supy(y)=7 ≤ supy(z)=7 ✓

Example 2 (x W z):
- z: infx(z)=5, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=5, supy(z)=7
- y: infx(y)=2, supx(y)=4, infy(y)=5, supy(y)=7
- x: infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=6, supy(x)=7

Checking x NW y:
- supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(y)=2 ✓
- supy(y)=7 ≤ infy(x)=6 ✗ (This is wrong! For NW, we need y to be south of x)

Let me correct this. For x NW y, we need supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Let's try again:

Example 2 (x W z):
- z: infx(z)=5, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=4, supy(z)=8
- y: infx(y)=2, supx(y)=4, infy(y)=5, supy(y)=7
- x: infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=8, supy(x)=9

Checking x NW y:
- supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(y)=2 ✓
- supy(y)=7 ≤ infy(x)=8 ✓

Checking y W z:
- supx(y)=4 ≤ infx(z)=5 ✓
- infy(z)=4 ≤ infy(y)=5 ✓
- supy(y)=7 ≤ supy(z)=8 ✓

But in this example, x is still NW of z, not W of z as I intended.

Let me try once more, being more careful with the vertical extents:

Example 2 (x W z):
- z: infx(z)=5, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=2, supy(z)=10
- y: infx(y)=2, supx(y)=4, infy(y)=4, supy(y)=8
- x: infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=5, supy(x)=7

Checking x NW y:
- supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(y)=2 ✓
- supy(y)=8 ≤ infy(x)=5 ✗ (Still wrong!)

I made an error in my understanding. For x NW y, we need supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x must be strictly north of y, with no vertical overlap.

Let me correct my understanding and try again:

For x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

For y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent)

Now let's derive the possible relations between x and z:

For the x-coordinate:
- From x NW y and y W z, we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- This means x is to the west of z

For the y-coordinate:
- From x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y W z)

From these, we can deduce:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- This implies infy(z) < infy(x)

But we cannot definitely determine the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) or supy(x). There are different possibilities:

1. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is strictly north of z, making it NW of z.
2. If infy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x), then x and z overlap vertically, making it W of z.
3. If supy(x) ≤ supy(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x's vertical extent is contained within z's vertical extent, still making it W of z.

So the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are NW and W.

Let me verify with some concrete examples:

Example 1 (x NW z):
- z: infx(z)=5, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=2, supy(z)=4
- y: infx(y)=2, supx(y)=4, infy(y)=2, supy(y)=4
- x: infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=5, supy(x)=6

Checking x NW y:
- supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(y)=2 ✓
- supy(y)=4 ≤ infy(x)=5 ✓

Checking y W z:
- supx(y)=4 ≤ infx(z)=5 ✓
- infy(z)=2 ≤ infy(y)=2 ✓
- supy(y)=4 ≤ supy(z)=4 ✓

Checking x NW z:
- supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(z)=5 ✓
- supy(z)=4 ≤ infy(x)=5 ✓

Example 2 (x W z):
- z: infx(z)=5, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=1, supy(z)=6
- y: infx(y)=2, supx(y)=4, infy(y)=2, supy(y)=5
- x: infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=3, supy(x)=4

Checking x NW y:
- supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(y)=2 ✓
- supy(y)=5 ≥ infy(x)=3 ✗ (This is wrong! For NW, we need y to be south of x)

Let me fix this and try again:

Example 2 (x W z):
- z: infx(z)=5, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=1, supy(z)=9
- y: infx(y)=2, supx(y)=4, infy(y)=3, supy(y)=6
- x: infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=7, supy(x)=8

Checking x NW y:
- supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(y)=2 ✓
- supy(y)=6 ≤ infy(x)=7 ✓

Checking y W z:
- supx(y)=4 ≤ infx(z)=5 ✓
- infy(z)=1 ≤ infy(y)=3 ✓
- supy(y)=6 ≤ supy(z)=9 ✓

Checking x W z:
- supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(z)=5 ✓
- infy(z)=1 ≤ infy(x)=7 ✓
- supy(x)=8 ≤ supy(z)=9 ✓

This verifies that both NW and W are possible relations between x and z.

Hmm, but I think I'm still not getting example 2 quite right. Let me verify the cardinal direction relation definitions again:

For x W z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent)

Looking at my Example 2:
- supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(z)=5 ✓
- infy(z)=1 ≤ infy(x)=7 ✓
- supy(x)=8 ≤ supy(z)=9 ✓

So this is indeed a valid example for x W z. Let me just consider if there are any other possible relations between x and z.

Let's summarize what we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (derived from our constraints)

This means that:
1. x is definitely to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z))
2. The lower bound of x's y-projection is greater than the lower bound of z's y-projection (infy(z) < infy(x))

From this, the possible relations are:
- NW: if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of z)
- W: if infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent or they partially overlap)

What about the possibility of x being SW of z? For this to be true, we would need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we have)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

But from our derivation, we have infy(z) < infy(x), which implies infy(z) < supy(x) (since infy(x) < supy(x)). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) ≤ infy(z) for SW. So x cannot be SW of z.

What about other cardinal directions involving the west direction:
- For SW: ruled out as shown above
- For NW: possible if x is north of z
- For W: possible if x and z overlap vertically

This means the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

But I think I should double-check my reasoning to make sure I'm not missing any other possible relations.

Let's go through the logic again from the beginning:

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For the x-coordinate:
- From x NW y and y W z, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is to the west of z

For the y-coordinate:
- From x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- This implies infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Therefore, infy(z) < infy(x)

Now, let's consider the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z:

1. NW: requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We already have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
   - For supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we don't have enough information
   - This is a possibility if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

2. W: requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We already have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
   - We already derived infy(z) < infy(x) ✓
   - For supy(x) ≤ supy(z), we don't have enough information
   - This is a possibility if supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

3. SW: requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We already have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
   - But we derived infy(z) < infy(x), which implies infy(z) < supy(x) (since infy(x) < supy(x))
   - This contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - So SW is not possible ✗

4. N: requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - But we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) < infx(z)
   - This contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - So N is not possible ✗

5. NE: requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - But we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) < supx(z)
   - This contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - So NE is not possible ✗

6. E: requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - Similarly, this contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - So E is not possible ✗

7. SE: requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - Similarly, this contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - So SE is not possible ✗

8. S: requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - This contradicts both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) < infy(x)
   - So S is not possible ✗

9. B: requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - So B is not possible ✗

Based on this analysis, the only possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are NW and W.

Let me double-check one more time with examples:

Example 1 (x NW z):
- z: infx(z)=5, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=2, supy(z)=4
- y: infx(y)=2, supx(y)=4, infy(y)=2, supy(y)=4
- x: infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=5, supy(x)=6

This satisfies:
- x NW y: supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(y)=2 and supy(y)=4 ≤ infy(x)=5 ✓
- y W z: supx(y)=4 ≤ infx(z)=5 and infy(z)=2 ≤ infy(y)=2 and supy(y)=4 ≤ supy(z)=4 ✓
- x NW z: supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(z)=5 and supy(z)=4 ≤ infy(x)=5 ✓

Example 2 (x W z):
- z: infx(z)=5, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=1, supy(z)=9
- y: infx(y)=2, supx(y)=4, infy(y)=3, supy(y)=6
- x: infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=7, supy(x)=8

This satisfies:
- x NW y: supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(y)=2 and supy(y)=6 ≤ infy(x)=7 ✓
- y W z: supx(y)=4 ≤ infx(z)=5 and infy(z)=1 ≤ infy(y)=3 and supy(y)=6 ≤ supy(z)=9 ✓
- x W z: supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(z)=5 and infy(z)=1 ≤ infy(x)=7 and supy(x)=8 ≤ supy(z)=9 ✓

This confirms that both NW and W are possible cardinal directions for x relative to z given the constraints.

Let me also verify if there are any other possibilities:

For x to be NW:B of z (a multi-tile relation), x would need to be in both the NW and B tiles of z. But since x is west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), it cannot be in the B tile, so NW:B is not possible.

Similarly, for W:B, x would need to be in both the W and B tiles of z, which is contradictory given that x is strictly to the west of z.

Let me see if there are any other multi-tile relations that could work:

For x to be NW:N of z, x would need to be in both the NW and N tiles of z. But this is impossible because:
- For NW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- For N: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
These are contradictory because NW requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) while N requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Similarly, for NW:W, W:NW, or any other combination involving NW and W with other tiles, we would have contradictions.

Therefore, the only possible cardinal directions for x relative to z given the constraints are NW and W.

Actually, it seems like I can derive a more precise relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

Given:
- x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y W z: supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
- This implies supy(y) ≤ min(infy(x), supy(z))

But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z). So we still have two possibilities:
1. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is NW of z.
2. If infy(x) < supy(z), then x is W of z.

So the possible cardinal directions remain NW and W.

Let me double-check if there are any other possible cardinal directions by examining every possibility:

1. For single-tile relations:
   - N, NE, E, SE, S, SW: ruled out by our derivation
   - NW, W: possible as shown
   - B: ruled out by our derivation

2. For multi-tile relations, we need to consider combinations where x is in multiple tiles of z:
   - For x to be in multiple tiles, those tiles must be adjacent
   - Since x is definitely west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), the only possible tiles are NW, W, and SW
   - But we ruled out SW earlier
   - So the only possible multi-tile relation would be NW:W

Let me check if NW:W is possible:
- For x to be in both NW and W tiles of z, x would need to span the boundary between these tiles
- The boundary is at y = supy(z)
- So we would need:
  - Some part of x to be in NW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ supy(x)
  - Some part of x to be in W: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- But these are contradictory because NW requires supy(z) ≤ supy(x) while W requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- For both to be true, we need supy(x) = supy(z), which is a very specific case
- In general, NW:W is not possible as a cardinal direction relation between regions

But wait, I think I'm making an error in my reasoning. The definition of cardinal direction relations allows for a region to span multiple tiles.

Let me reconsider:

For x to be in the NW tile of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

For x to be in the W tile of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

For x to be in both NW and W tiles of z (i.e., x NW:W z), we would need:
- Part of x to be in the NW tile and part of x to be in the W tile
- This means x crosses the boundary between NW and W
- This boundary is at y = supy(z)
- So we would need infy(x) < supy(z) < supy(x)

Given our constraints:
- We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is west of z)
- We know infy(z) < infy(x) (derived earlier)

Is it possible for x to span both NW and W tiles? Yes, if:
- infy(x) < supy(z) < supy(x)

This is not inconsistent with our constraints, so x NW:W z is a possibility.

Let me provide an example where x spans both NW and W tiles of z:

- z: infx(z)=5, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=3, supy(z)=7
- y: infx(y)=2, supx(y)=4, infy(y)=4, supy(y)=6
- x: infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=6, supy(x)=8

This satisfies:
- x NW y: supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(y)=2 and supy(y)=6 ≤ infy(x)=6 ✓
- y W z: supx(y)=4 ≤ infx(z)=5 and infy(z)=3 ≤ infy(y)=4 and supy(y)=6 ≤ supy(z)=7 ✓
- x spans both NW and W tiles of z:
  - supx(x)=1 ≤ infx(z)=5 (x is west of z) ✓
  - infy(x)=6 < supy(z)=7 < supy(x)=8 (x crosses the NW-W boundary) ✓

So the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- NW (if x is entirely in the NW tile of z)
- W (if x is entirely in the W tile of z)
- NW:W (if x spans both NW and W tiles of z)

Actually, I think I need to be careful about how I'm interpreting the definition of cardinal direction relations.

NW:W does not mean that part of x is in the NW tile and part is in the W tile. Rather, it means that x is the union of two regions, one in the NW tile and one in the W tile, and this union is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk (i.e., it's connected).

So for x NW:W z to be true, we would need:
- A connected region x1 such that x1 NW z
- A connected region x2 such that x2 W z
- x = x1 ∪ x2 and x is connected

Given our constraints, is this possible? Yes, because the regions NW and W share a boundary, so it's possible to have a connected region that spans both tiles.

So the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- NW (if x is entirely in the NW tile of z)
- W (if x is entirely in the W tile of z)
- NW:W (if x spans both NW and W tiles of z)

Actually, let me reinterpret the definition of multi-tile cardinal direction relations again.

The definition says "A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

This means that for a multi-tile relation like NW:W, the region x should be expressible as the union of two regions, one in the NW tile of z and one in the W tile of z, and this union should be a region in REG (i.e., it should be connected).

Given our constraints, is this possible? Yes. The NW and W tiles are adjacent, so it's possible to have a connected region that spans both tiles.

So the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- NW (if x is entirely in the NW tile of z)
- W (if x is entirely in the W tile of z)
- NW:W (if x spans both NW and W tiles of z)

Let me just review to make sure I haven't missed anything:

1. For single-tile relations:
   - B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW: ruled out by our derivations
   - NW, W: possible as shown

2. For multi-tile relations:
   - Given that x is west of z, the only possible tiles are NW, W, and SW
   - But we ruled out SW earlier
   - NW:W is possible as shown
   - No other combinations are possible

So the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are NW, W, and NW:W.

Actually, let me try a more systematic approach to make sure I haven't missed anything.

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (implying infy(z) < infy(x))

Now, let's check all possible cardinal directions between x and z:

1. B: requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - So B is not possible ✗

2. N: requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - So N is not possible ✗

3. NE: requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - So NE is not possible ✗

4. E: requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - So E is not possible ✗

5. SE: requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - This contradicts both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) < infy(x)
   - So SE is not possible ✗

6. S: requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - This contradicts both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) < infy(x)
   - So S is not possible ✗

7. SW: requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
   - But we also have infy(z) < infy(x), which implies infy(z) < supy(x)
   - This contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - So SW is not possible ✗

8. W: requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
   - We have infy(z) < infy(x) ✓
   - For supy(x) ≤ supy(z), we don't have enough information
   - This is a possibility if supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ✓

9. NW: requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
   - For supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we don't have enough information
   - This is a possibility if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓

Now for multi-tile relations, we need to check if x can span multiple tiles of z. Given that x is definitely west of z, it can only potentially span the NW, W, and SW tiles. But since SW is ruled out, it can only span NW and W.

This is possible if x can be expressed as the union of two connected regions, one in the NW tile of z and one in the W tile of z, such that the union is also connected. This is possible because NW and W are adjacent tiles.

So NW:W is a possibility.

Are there any other possible multi-tile relations? Let's check:

- NW:B: Not possible because B requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- W:B: Not possible for the same reason
- NW:N: Not possible because N requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- W:N: Not possible for the same reason
- NW:E: Not possible because E requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- W:E: Not possible for the same reason

Similar contradictions arise for all other multi-tile relations.

So the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- NW (if x is entirely in the NW tile of z)
- W (if x is entirely in the W tile of z)
- NW:W (if x spans both NW and W tiles of z)

Actually, I've reread the definition of cardinal directions for the 9-intersection model and I'm not sure if my understanding of multi-tile relations is correct. Let me focus on the single-tile relations, which are NW and W, as these are definitely correct.

The possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are NW and W.

Let me try to find a comprehensive explanation:

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (implying infy(z) < infy(x))

The possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:

1. NW: requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
   - For supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we don't have enough information
   - This is a possibility if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓

2. W: requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
   - We have infy(z) < infy(x) ✓
   - For supy(x) ≤ supy(z), we don't have enough information
   - This is a possibility if supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ✓

All other cardinal directions are ruled out.

Actually, let's go back to multi-tile relations. The approach I've been taking is inconsistent. Let me try to understand the definition of cardinal direction relations more carefully.

The definition says: "A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

This means that for a multi-tile relation like NW:W, the region x should be expressible as the union of two regions, one in the NW tile of z and one in the W tile of z, and this union should be a region in REG (i.e., it should be connected).

So, for x NW:W z to be true, we need to find connected regions x1 and x2 such that:
- x1 NW z
- x2 W z
- x = x1 ∪ x2 and x is connected

This is possible if x spans both the NW and W tiles of z. However, I was not treating the multi-tile relation in this way. I need to be more careful how I define them.

Actually, let me make this more conceptually. I know the RCC-8/CDC framework for cardinal directions, so let's think of it in these terms:

- The CDC partitions the space around z into 9 tiles: B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
- A region x can be in one or more of these tiles
- The cardinal direction relation between x and z is the set of tiles that x intersects

Given our constraints, we know:
- x is definitely to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z))
- The lower bound of x's y-projection is greater than the lower bound of z's y-projection (infy(z) < infy(x))

From these:
- x can be entirely in the NW tile of z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- x can be entirely in the W tile of z (if infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
- x can span both NW and W tiles of z (if infy(x) < supy(z) < supy(x))

These translate to the cardinal direction relations NW, W, and NW:W respectively.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are NW, W, and NW:W.

Let me double-check if NW:W is really a valid cardinal direction relation according to the definition.

The definition says a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where:
i) 1 <= k <= 9
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}
iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j
iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG

For NW:W:
i) k = 2 ✓
ii) NW, W belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE} ✓
iii) NW <> W ✓
iv) We need to find regions a1, a2 such that a1 NW z, a2 W z, and a1 ∪ a2 is a region in REG

Now, the question is whether (iv) is always possible or there are constraints. Looking at the definition, it says "for any reference region b belongs to REG", which means it should work for any region z in REG.

Since the NW and W tiles of z are adjacent, it's possible to have a region that spans both of these tiles. So NW:W is a valid cardinal direction relation.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are NW, W, and NW:W.

Actually, hang on. Let me be really, really precise here. The problem is asking for the "possible relations between region x and region z", not really about the possible cardinal direction relations. So I think it's asking about the possible single-tile relations that can hold, which would be NW and W.

But then again, the problem is about cardinal directions, and NW:W is a valid cardinal direction relation. So I'm inclined to include it.

The phrasing is ambiguous, but I think the most comprehensive answer is that the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are NW, W, and NW:W.

But let's double-check our logic one more time. Concretely, given:
- x NW y
- y W z

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

From x NW y, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

From y W z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For the x-coordinate, combining supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- From these, we can't directly derive a relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) or between supy(x) and supy(z)

So, x is definitely to the west of z, and we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which gives us infy(z) < infy(x).

This allows for the following possibilities:

1. NW: if x is in the NW tile of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
2. W: if x is in the W tile of z, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
3. NW:W: if x spans both the NW and W tiles of z

Given that infy(z) < infy(x), and that we can have either supy(z) ≤ infy(x) or infy(x) < supy(z) < supy(x) or supy(x) ≤ supy(z), all three relations are possible.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and NW:W.

Actually, let's review the wording of the question one more time: "If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

Since the problem is about cardinal directions, and it's asking for "possible relations", I believe it's asking for all possible cardinal direction relations that could hold between x and z, which would include NW, W, and NW:W.

But let's check the problem statement one more time to be sure. The problem statement refers to "The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B" and only mentions single-tile relations. So it seems like the problem is only asking about single-tile relations, not multi-tile relations.

In that case, the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

On closer analysis:
- For "If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", I think it's asking for all possible cardinal direction relations, which would include NW, W, and NW:W.
- However, the problem statement mentions "The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B", which only includes single-tile relations.

Given this, I'll interpret the question as asking about single-tile relations only, so the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

Actually, wait. The description of the problem refers to multi-tile relations - it says: "A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

But then it says "The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B", which only includes single-tile relations.

This seems contradictory. But I'm going to trust that the problem is asking about single-tile relations only, so the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

Actually, I've reread the part that says "The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B". This is just telling us what the possible individual answers are, not restricting the answer to single-tile relations. It's saying that the answer could be one or more of these individual directions.

So, given our derivation, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and NW:W.

However, in my final answer, I have to stick with the options provided in the problem statement, which are N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B. Among these, the possible relations are NW and W.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

Actually, I've missed something. The problem statement includes the precise definition of a cardinal direction relation, which includes multi-tile relations, but then at the very end it says:

"The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B. No yapping."

This suggests that the answer should only include single-tile relations. Given this, the answer is:

The possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions:
- x is NW of y
- y is W of z

Let me analyze what these conditions tell us about the possible relations between x and z.

From x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's vertical extent is within z's)

Combining these:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
  → x is definitely west of z

- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), which means infy(z) < infy(x)
  → x is at least partially north of z's lower bound

This allows for two possible relations:
1. NW: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely north of z)
2. W: If infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's vertical extent is within z's)

NW, W
