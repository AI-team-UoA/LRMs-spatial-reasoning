PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this step by step.

We have:
- region x is S of region y
- region y is N of region z

And we need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions:
- x S y if and only if supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y N z if and only if supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, let's analyze what we know about the coordinates:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x doesn't extend to the left of y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x doesn't extend to the right of y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y doesn't extend to the left of z)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y doesn't extend to the right of z)

Now let's combine this information to determine the possible relationships between x and z:

From the y-coordinates:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z)

This doesn't directly tell us about the y-coordinate relationship between x and z. x could be below z, or z could be below x, or they could overlap in the y-direction.

From the x-coordinates:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x S y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z)

Combining these: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
This means x doesn't extend as far left as z might.

Similarly:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x S y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

Combining these: supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
This means x doesn't extend as far right as z might.

So in the x-direction, x is "contained" within the x-projection of z. But in the y-direction, x and z could have various relationships.

Let's enumerate the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. x S z: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   This would require that both x and z are completely below y, with x below z.
   Is this possible? Yes, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), so it's possible that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   We also need to check if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which we already established above.
   So x S z is a possibility.

2. x N z: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely below x.
   Is this possible? We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't tell us about the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   Again, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which we've established.
   So x N z is also a possibility.

3. x B z: For this, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We've already established infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The y-coordinate conditions would require x to be "inside" z vertically, which is certainly possible given what we know.
   So x B z is a possibility.

4. x SE z: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   We know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x SE z is not possible.

5. x SW z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   We know supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), but this doesn't tell us about infx(z). It's possible that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but it's also possible that they overlap.
   Given our constraints, it's not clear if this is possible, but it doesn't seem to be ruled out.
   Wait, let me think about the x-coordinate relationships more:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x): this means z extends further left than x.
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z): this means z extends further right than x.
   For x SW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which would mean x is entirely to the left of z. But given infx(z) ≤ infx(x), x starts to the right of where z starts, which contradicts x being entirely to the left of z.
   So x SW z is not possible.

6. x NE z: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   We already know that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x NE z is not possible.

7. x NW z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   We've already determined that x SW z is not possible because supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts our known relationships. The same applies here, so x NW z is not possible.

8. x E z: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   As we've seen, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) contradicts our known relationship infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x E z is not possible.

9. x W z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   As we've discussed, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts our known relationships, so x W z is not possible.

So, from our analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: S, N, and B.

Let me double-check this by considering specific examples to see if I've missed anything:

Consider a simple case where y is a rectangle with corners at (1,4), (3,4), (3,6), and (1,6).

For x S y, x must be below y. Let's say x is a rectangle with corners at (1,1), (3,1), (3,3), and (1,3). This satisfies x S y because supy(x) = 3 ≤ infy(y) = 4, infx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 1, and supx(x) = 3 ≤ supx(y) = 3.

For y N z, z must be below y. Let's say z is a rectangle with corners at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), and (0,2). This satisfies y N z because supy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 4, infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(y) = 1, and supx(y) = 3 ≤ supx(z) = 4.

Now, let's determine the cardinal direction relation between x and z in this example:
- x's corners are at (1,1), (3,1), (3,3), and (1,3).
- z's corners are at (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), and (0,2).

We have:
- infx(x) = 1, which is greater than infx(z) = 0.
- supx(x) = 3, which is less than supx(z) = 4.
- infy(x) = 1, which is greater than infy(z) = 0.
- supy(x) = 3, which is greater than supy(z) = 2.

In this case, x extends higher than z, and z extends wider than x. The relation is not straightforward.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning above when describing the constraints we get from "x S y" and "y N z". Let me re-analyze:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, let's combine:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x): This means z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z): This means z's right boundary is to the right of x's right boundary.

In terms of the y-coordinates, we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

This means both x and z are below y, but their relative positions are not determined by the given constraints. 

Let's consider the possible relative positions of x and z:

1. x could be entirely to the southwest of z. For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z). We know supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), but this doesn't tell us about infx(z). Also, both are below y, but their relative vertical positions are undetermined.

2. x could be entirely to the southeast of z. For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x). We know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary. This doesn't tell us about supx(z) and infx(x). Again, their vertical relationship is undetermined.

3. x could be entirely to the northwest of z. For this, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z). The vertical condition is undetermined. For the horizontal condition, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), but this doesn't tell us about infx(z).

4. x could be entirely to the northeast of z. For this, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x). The vertical condition is undetermined. For the horizontal condition, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary. This is consistent with x being to the right of z.

5. x could be entirely to the south of z. For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The vertical condition is undetermined. For the horizontal conditions, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary and z's right boundary is to the right of x's right boundary. This is consistent with x being "inside" or "surrounded" by z horizontally.

6. x could be entirely to the north of z. For this, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The vertical condition is undetermined. The horizontal conditions are the same as in case 5, so they're consistent.

7. x could be entirely to the west of z. For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The vertical conditions are undetermined. For the horizontal condition, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), but this doesn't tell us about infx(z).

8. x could be entirely to the east of z. For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The vertical conditions are undetermined. For the horizontal condition, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary. This doesn't tell us about supx(z) and infx(x).

9. x could be inside or "bounded by" z. For this, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The horizontal conditions are consistent with what we know. The vertical conditions are undetermined.

From the analysis above, the horizontal relationships between x and z are constrained by what we know, but the vertical relationships are largely undetermined. The fact that both x and z are below y doesn't tell us which one is higher or if they overlap vertically.

Thinking about this more carefully, let me redo the analysis for specific relationships:

1. x S z (x is south of z): For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The horizontal conditions are consistent with what we know. The vertical condition is undetermined from our constraints, but it's certainly possible.

2. x N z (x is north of z): For this, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Again, the horizontal conditions are consistent, and the vertical condition is undetermined but possible.

3. x B z (x is bounded by z): For this, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The horizontal conditions are consistent. The vertical conditions are undetermined but possible.

4. x SE z (x is southeast of z): For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The vertical condition, as before, is undetermined. The horizontal condition, however, requires that z is entirely to the left of x. We know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary. But this doesn't tell us about supx(z) and infx(x), so x SE z is possible.

5. x SW z (x is southwest of z): For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The vertical condition is undetermined. For the horizontal condition, we need x to be entirely to the left of z. But we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary. This contradicts x being entirely to the left of z, so x SW z is not possible.

6. x NE z (x is northeast of z): For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The vertical condition is undetermined. The horizontal condition requires z to be entirely to the left of x. Similar to case 4, x NE z is possible.

7. x NW z (x is northwest of z): For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The vertical condition is undetermined. The horizontal condition requires x to be entirely to the left of z. Similar to case 5, x NW z is not possible due to the known relationship infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).

8. x E z (x is east of z): For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The vertical conditions are undetermined. The horizontal condition requires z to be entirely to the left of x. Similar to cases 4 and 6, x E z is possible.

9. x W z (x is west of z): For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Similar to cases 5 and 7, the horizontal condition contradicts our known relationship, so x W z is not possible.

So, from this analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: S, N, B, SE, NE, and E.

But wait, I need to think about these more carefully, especially the ones where x is to the right or east of z. Let's double-check:

For x SE z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
For the horizontal condition, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), but this doesn't directly tell us about supx(z) and infx(x). However, it's possible to have regions z and x where supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means z is entirely to the left of x.

For x NE z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Similar to the SE case, it's possible to have regions where z is entirely to the left of x, so x NE z is possible.

For x E z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Again, it's possible to have regions where z is entirely to the left of x, so x E z is possible.

Actually, I think I may have been overthinking this a bit. Let's take a step back. We know:

From x S y:
- x is below y
- x is "horizontally contained" within y (i.e., x doesn't extend beyond y on the left or right)

From y N z:
- z is below y
- y is "horizontally contained" within z (i.e., y doesn't extend beyond z on the left or right)

From these, I can infer:
- Both x and z are below y, but I don't know their vertical relationship with each other.
- x is "horizontally contained" within y, and y is "horizontally contained" within z. Therefore, x is also "horizontally contained" within z. But, importantly, z could extend much wider than x on both sides, or x's left edge could be to the left of z's left edge, or x's right edge could be to the right of z's right edge.

Given these constraints, let's enumerate all the possibilities for the relationship between x and z (I'll draw them where y is a box from (0,0) to (1,1), x is below y, and z is also below y, but the exact dimensions might vary).

Since both x and z are below y, and x is horizontally within z, the possibliities are:

1. x S z: If x is below z, which is below y.
2. x N z: If z is below x, which is below y.
3. x SE z: If x is below and to the right of z.
4. x NE z: If x is above and to the right of z.
5. x B z: If x is "inside" z.
6. x E z: If x is to the right of z.

The relationships x SW z, x NW z, and x W z are not possible because we know x is horizontally contained within z, so x can't be to the left of z.

Hmm, wait. I'm getting confused by the constraints. Let me be very precise about what we know:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

This means x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge, and x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge. In other words, x is "horizontally contained" within z, although they might not overlap in the y-direction.

For the vertical relationship, we know both x and z are below y, but we don't know their relationship with each other.

Let's go through each possible relationship:

1. x S z: For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The horizontal conditions are satisfied. The vertical condition is undetermined from our known constraints, but it's consistent with both x and z being below y, so x S z is possible.

2. x N z: For this, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Again, the horizontal conditions are satisfied, and the vertical condition is consistent with our known constraints, so x N z is possible.

3. x SE z: For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The vertical condition is consistent with both x and z being below y. The horizontal condition requires z to be entirely to the left of x. But we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary. This doesn't automatically mean that supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but it doesn't rule it out either.

Actually, the fact that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) implies that z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge, which is consistent with x SE z (where x is entirely to the right of z). But infx(z) ≤ infx(x) doesn't necessarily mean that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which is what we need for x SE z). It's possible that z overlaps with x horizontally.

So, for x SE z, I need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which isn't guaranteed by the known constraints. In fact, the known constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) implies supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which doesn't tell me directly about the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).

Let's think about it like this: the only constraint on the horizontal relationship is that x is "horizontally contained" within z. This means x can't be entirely to the left or right of z. But it could be partially to the left or right, or entirely within z.

So, for x SE z, I need x to be entirely to the right of z, which contradicts x being "horizontally contained" within z. Therefore, x SE z is not possible.

Similarly, x NE z would also require x to be entirely to the right of z, which contradicts our known constraints. So, x NE z is not possible.

4. x SW z: For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The vertical condition is consistent. The horizontal condition requires x to be entirely to the left of z. But we know supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary. This doesn't automatically mean that supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

But, given that infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), it means z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge. If z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge, then x can't be entirely to the left of z (which is what x SW z requires). So, x SW z is not possible.

Similarly, x NW z would also require x to be entirely to the left of z, which contradicts our known constraints. So, x NW z is not possible.

5. x E z: For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The vertical conditions are undetermined from our known constraints, but they're consistent with both x and z being below y. The horizontal condition requires z to be entirely to the left of x, which contradicts x being "horizontally contained" within z. So, x E z is not possible.

Similarly, x W z would require x to be entirely to the left of z, which contradicts our known constraints. So, x W z is not possible.

6. x B z: For this, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The horizontal conditions are satisfied from our known constraints. The vertical conditions are undetermined, but they're consistent with both x and z being below y. So, x B z is possible.

From the analysis above, the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: S, N, and B.

I can double-check these results by thinking about concrete examples:

Example 1: Let the regions be rectangles: y = [2,4] × [6,8], x = [2.5, 3.5] × [4, 5], and z = [1, 5] × [2, 3]. Then x S y, y N z, and x N z. This shows that x N z is possible.

Example 2: Let the regions be rectangles: y = [2,4] × [6,8], x = [2.5, 3.5] × [2, 3], and z = [1, 5] × [4, 5]. Then x S y, y N z, and x S z. This shows that x S z is possible.

Example 3: Let the regions be rectangles: y = [2,4] × [6,8], x = [2.5, 3.5] × [3, 4], and z = [1, 5] × [2, 5]. Then x S y, y N z, and x B z. This shows that x B z is possible.

By the definition, the set of regions is defined as homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This means the regions are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries, but I believe all of my examples above can be slightly modified (e.g., making them less regular, or adding a few curves to the boundary), while still using the same bounding boxes, which would give the same results, so the answer doesn't change.

Actually, let me check if I'm misunderstanding the original definition of S. It says:
a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

We are saying that the region is south of the reference region. "South" means below.

The first condition, supy(a) ≤ infy(b) means that a's highest point is below b's lowest point. This is what we'd expect for "a is south of b".

The other two conditions, infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b), mean that a is "horizontally contained" within b. This is a bit more specific than just "a is south of b" (in a colloquial sense), but it's the formal definition.

So for x S y, it means x is below y and "horizontally contained" within y. And for y N z, it means z is below y and y is "horizontally contained" within z. From these, we can deduce that x is "horizontally contained" within z, but the vertical relationship between x and z is undetermined.

Let me try to re-analyze the problem from the beginning.

So, I have regions x, y, and z, and I know:
- x S y, which means x is south of y. In other words, x is below y and horizontally contained within y.
- y N z, which means y is north of z. In other words, z is below y and y is horizontally contained within z.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of y's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of y's right boundary)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z's left boundary is to the left of y's left boundary)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z's right boundary is to the right of y's right boundary)

Combining these:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)

In other words, x is "horizontally contained" within z.

From the y-coordinates, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

This tells us both x and z are below y, but it doesn't determine the relative vertical positions of x and z.

Let's run through each of the 9 possible cardinal direction relations and check which ones are possible.

1. x B z: For this, we need x to be "inside" z, i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've already established infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) from our known constraints. The vertical conditions infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) are not directly determined by our known constraints, but they're consistent with both x and z being below y. So, x B z is possible.

2. x S z: For this, we need x to be "south" of z, i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We've already established infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The vertical condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is not directly determined by our known constraints, but it's consistent with both x and z being below y; x could be entirely below z. So, x S z is possible.

3. x SW z: For this, we need x to be "southwest" of z, i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We've established supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but this doesn't tell us about infx(z). In fact, we've established infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary. This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which would mean x is entirely to the left of z). So, x SW z is not possible.

4. x W z: For this, we need x to be "west" of z, i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Similar to the SW case, the horizontal condition contradict our known constraints. So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z: For this, we need x to be "northwest" of z, i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Similar to the SW and W cases, the horizontal condition contradict our known constraints. So, x NW z is not possible.

6. x N z: For this, we need x to be "north" of z, i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We've already established infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The vertical condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not directly determined by our known constraints, but it's consistent with both x and z being below y; z could be entirely below x. So, x N z is possible.

7. x NE z: For this, we need x to be "northeast" of z, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We've established supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary. This contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which would mean z is entirely to the left of x). So, x NE z is not possible.

8. x E z: For this, we need x to be "east" of z, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Similar to the NE case, the horizontal condition contradicts our known constraints. So, x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z: For this, we need x to be "southeast" of z, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Similar to the NE and E cases, the horizontal condition contradicts our known constraints. So, x SE z is not possible.

So, from our analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: B, S, and N.

Let's double-check with a few concrete examples:

Example 1: Let the regions be rectangles: y = [2,4] × [6,8], x = [2.5, 3.5] × [4, 5], and z = [1, 5] × [2, 3]. Then x S y, y N z, and x N z. This shows that x N z is possible.

Example 2: Let the regions be rectangles: y = [2,4] × [6,8], x = [2.5, 3.5] × [2, 3], and z = [1, 5] × [4, 5]. Then x S y, y N z, and x S z. This shows that x S z is possible.

Example 3: Let the regions be rectangles: y = [2,4] × [6,8], x = [2.5, 3.5] × [3, 4], and z = [1, 5] × [2, 5]. Then x S y, y N z, and x B z. This shows that x B z is possible.

So, in summary, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: B, S, and N.

That's the answer I get, but let's just triple-check by revisiting the definitions.

x S y means supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). So x is below y and horizontally within y.

y N z means supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z). So z is below y and horizontally contains y.

Combined, the conditions are:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge)
supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge)
(no relationship directly between supy(x) and infy(z)).

The bounds on the infx and supx values tell us that x is horizontally contained within z.

Given our known constraints, x can be:
- x B z: If x is "inside" z, which is consistent with x being horizontally contained in z.
- x S z: If x is "south" of z, which is consistent with x being horizontally contained in z.
- x N z: If x is "north" of z, which is consistent with x being horizontally contained in z.

All other cardinal direction relations would require x to not be horizontally contained within z, which contradicts our known constraints.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: B, S, and N.

Actually, let me analyze this in a slightly different way for clarity. Let's consider the 9 tiles or regions around a bounding box:

NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | B | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE

For x S y, the region x is in the S tile with respect to y.
For y N z, the region y is in the N tile with respect to z.

Now, let's consider the relationship between x and z. Given our known constraints, x is horizontally contained within z. This means if we superimpose z's bounding box on the 9-tile grid, x can only be in the N, B, or S tiles. It can't be in the NW, W, SW, NE, E, or SE tiles because those tiles extend horizontally beyond z's bounding box.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: B, S, and N. That's our final answer.

ANSWER:

The correct answer is: N, S, B

When analyzing this problem, I need to determine how the given relations constrain the possible relationships between x and z.

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x doesn't extend to the left of y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x doesn't extend to the right of y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far left as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as y)

Combining these constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)

This means x is "horizontally contained" within z.

For the vertical relationship, we know both x and z are below y, but their vertical relationship with each other is not determined by the given constraints.

Given the horizontal constraint and the undetermined vertical relationship, x can only have three possible relationships with z:

1. N: If z is completely below x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
2. S: If x is completely below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
3. B: If x is horizontally inside z and also vertically contained within z

The other 6 relations are impossible because they would require x to extend horizontally beyond z in some way, which contradicts our established constraints.
