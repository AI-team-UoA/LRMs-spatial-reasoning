PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the spatial relationships step by step.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is B of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall what each relation means:

x W y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-projection is contained within y's y-projection)

y B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection)

Now, let's analyze what we know about x relative to z.

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (1)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (2)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (3)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (4)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (5)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (6)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (7)

Now, let's determine what we can say about x relative to z:

For the x-coordinates:
From (1) and (4), we have:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
This gives us: supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)

We cannot directly infer a relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) from these inequalities. However, we know that supx(x) is at most infx(y), and infx(z) is at most infx(y) as well. So, it's possible that:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (if infx(z) >= infx(y))
- Or, supx(x) > infx(z) (if infx(z) < infx(y))

This means x could be W, NW, or SW of z.

For the y-coordinates:
From (2), (3), (6), and (7), we have:
infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

This gives us:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

This condition is satisfied for any of the following cardinal directions: B, W, NW, SW, N, S, NE, E, SE.

Combining our analyses, the possible relations between x and z include W, NW, and SW.

Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me think more carefully.

When we say region x is W of region y, it means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-projection is contained within y's y-projection)

And when we say region y is B of region z, it means y is inside the bounding box of z.

Let's visualize this:

```
    z
  +------+
  |      |
  |  y   |
  |  +--+|
  |  |  ||
  |  +--+|
  |      |
  +------+

x
+--+
|  |
+--+
```

In this diagram, x is W of y, and y is B of z.

What is the relationship between x and z? From the diagram, it appears that x could be W of z.

But let's check this more rigorously:

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (1)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (2)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (3)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (4)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (5)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (6)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (7)

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (8)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (9)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (10)

Let's check if these conditions can be satisfied:

From (1) and (4), we have:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
From these, we cannot directly determine if supx(x) <= infx(z) (condition 8). It's possible that either:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supx(x) > infx(z)

So, x might or might not be to the west of z.

From (2) and (6), we have:
infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
Combining these, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
So, condition (9) is satisfied.

From (3) and (7), we have:
supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
Combining these, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
So, condition (10) is satisfied.

Now, based on the above, we can determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the west of z. Combined with conditions (9) and (10), this means x could be W of z.

2. If supx(x) > infx(z), then x overlaps with z in the x-dimension. Given that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), this means x could be B of z.

Wait, there's an issue with my reasoning. Let's reconsider:

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (1)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (2)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (3)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (4)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (5)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (6)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (7)

From (1) and (4), we have:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
These don't directly tell us the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

From (2) and (6), we have:
infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
Combining these, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
So, infy(z) <= infy(x)

From (3) and (7), we have:
supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
Combining these, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
So, supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, let's think spatially. We have:
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

This tells us that in the y-dimension, the projection of x is contained within the projection of z. But we don't have a definitive relationship in the x-dimension.

Hmm, I need to take a step back and think about this differently.

Let's try to determine the possible positions of region x relative to region z, given the constraints:

1. Region x is W of region y: This means region x is to the west of region y, and y's y-projection is contained within x's y-projection.
2. Region y is B of region z: This means region y is inside the bounding box of region z.

The key insight is that region z contains region y, but region x is west of region y. So, region x could be west of region z, but it doesn't have to be.

Let's think of it visually again. Since region y is B of region z, that means in the x-dimension, infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). Since region x is W of region y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y).

Hmm, I'm going to try a slightly different direction. Let's think about the constraints on the coordinates:

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-projection is contained within y's y-projection)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is inside the x-bounds of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is inside the y-bounds of z)

Given the constraints on the x-dimension, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)

Now, there are two cases:
1. If infx(z) <= supx(x), then region x overlaps with region z in the x-dimension.
2. If supx(x) < infx(z), then region x is to the left of region z.

For the y-dimension, we have:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)
Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
So, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Since infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), there are three possibilities for the y-dimension:
1. If infy(x) < supy(z) (which is always true given the constraints), then region x can start from somewhere within region z (in the y-dimension) or above it.
2. If supy(x) > infy(z) (which is always true given the constraints), then region x can end somewhere within region z (in the y-dimension) or below it.
3. At the same time, infy(x) can be less than, equal to, or greater than infy(z). And supy(x) can be less than or equal to supy(z).

Given all these constraints, the possible relations between region x and region z are:

W: If supx(x) < infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). In this case, region x is to the west of region z.

NW: If supx(x) < infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). In this case, region x is to the northwest of region z.

SW: If supx(x) < infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). In this case, region x is to the southwest of region z.

B: If infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). In this case, region x is inside the bounding box of region z.

Actually, this is getting a bit complex, and I'm concerned I'm either overcomplicating or missing some important constraints. Let's approach it differently:

If region x is W of region y, and region y is B of region z, let's use the transitivity of the cardinal direction relation:

If something is W of a bounding box, it is definitely W of the region inside that bounding box.

Let's visualize this:

```
    z
  +------+
  |      |
  |  y   |
  |  +--+|
  |  |  ||
  |  +--+|
  |      |
  +------+

x
+--+
|  |
+--+
```

In this diagram, x is W of y, and y is B of z.

From the diagram, it looks like x is W of z. But I'm unsure if this is the only possible relation. Let's think step by step.

We know:
1. x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
2. y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is inside the x-bounds of z)

Combining these constraints, we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)

While we can deduce that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we cannot directly deduce a relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

Let's try a concrete example:

Assume:
- infx(y) = 10
- infx(z) = 5
- supx(x) = 8

In this example, x W y (since supx(x) <= infx(y), which is 8 <= 10), and y B z (since infx(z) <= infx(y), which is 5 <= 10). However, x is not W of z because supx(x) > infx(z) (8 > 5).

So, we can conclude that the relation between x and z can be "W" (if supx(x) <= infx(z)), but it can also be something else (if supx(x) > infx(z)).

Now, let's consider the y-dimension constraints to further determine the possible relations between x and z.

We know:
1. x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-projection is contained within y's y-projection)
2. y B z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is inside the y-bounds of z)

Combining these constraints, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let me draw a scenario where x is not W of z, but rather overlaps with z in the x-dimension.

```
     z
  +------+
  |      |
  |  y   |
  |  +--+|
  |  |  ||
  |  +--+|
  |      |
  +------+

  x
+--+
|  |
+--+
```

In this diagram, x is W of y, and y is B of z. But x partially overlaps with z in the x-dimension.

Given the constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (z's bottom edge is below or at x's bottom edge)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top edge is below or at z's top edge)

And considering the x-dimension:
- If infx(z) <= supx(x), then x overlaps with z in the x-dimension.

So, the relation between x and z could also be B (if infy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) or one of the other relations, depending on the specific coordinates.

Hmm, I'm overcomplicating this again, on second thought. Let me go back to the basic constraints.

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (y's y-projection is within x's y-projection)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is inside the x-bounds of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is inside the y-bounds of z)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from the x-dimension)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from the y-dimension)

So, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now, for the possible relations between x and z, we need to consider all possible cases:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the west of z. Combined with the constraints on the y-dimension, x could be W, NW, or SW of z, depending on the specific coordinates.

2. If supx(x) > infx(z), then x overlaps with z in the x-dimension. Combined with the constraints on the y-dimension, x could be B, N, or S of z, depending on the specific coordinates.

Hmm, there's actually something important I missed: the constraints on the y-dimension derived from "x W y" and "y B z". Let's revisit.

From x W y:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (y's y-projection is within x's y-projection)

From y B z:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is inside the y-bounds of z)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
- So, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

The constraint `infy(z) <= infy(x)` means that z's bottom edge is below or at x's bottom edge. The constraint `supy(x) <= supy(z)` means that x's top edge is below or at z's top edge.

Now, for the relation between x and z to be W, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (z's y-projection is within x's y-projection)

The second constraint is already satisfied based on our derived constraints. So, for x to be W of z, we only need to ensure that supx(x) <= infx(z).

For the relation between x and z to be NW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

The first constraint can be satisfied, but the second constraint, supy(z) <= infy(x), can contradict the derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) (unless supy(z) = infy(z) and infy(x) = infy(z), which is a very specific case). So, in general, it's unlikely for x to be NW of z.

For the relation between x and z to be SW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

The first constraint can be satisfied, but the second constraint, supy(x) <= infy(z), can contradict the derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) (unless supy(x) = infy(x) and infy(x) = infy(z), which is a very specific case). So, in general, it's unlikely for x to be SW of z.

Hmm, I'm getting confused in my own analysis. Let's go back to the definitions of the cardinal directions.

In the problem statement, we have:

- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a's y-projection is contained within b's y-projection)
- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, given "x W y":
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-projection is contained within y's y-projection)

And given "y B z":
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection)

When combining these, we get:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y B z and x W y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from x W y and y B z)

So, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

For the x-dimension, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

From these, we cannot directly deduce a relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). They could be in any of these positions:
1. supx(x) < infx(z)
2. supx(x) = infx(z)
3. infx(z) < supx(x)

Let's check all possible cardinal directions and see which ones are consistent with our derived constraints:

W: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
The constraints on the y-dimension are already satisfied. The constraint on the x-dimension, supx(x) <= infx(z), can be satisfied in cases 1 and 2. So, W is a possible relation.

NW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
The constraint on the x-dimension, supx(x) <= infx(z), can be satisfied in cases 1 and 2. But the constraint on the y-dimension, supy(z) <= infy(x), contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) <= supy(z) (unless supy(z) = infy(x), which is a very specific case). So, in general, NW is not a consistent relation.

SW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
The constraint on the x-dimension, supx(x) <= infx(z), can be satisfied in cases 1 and 2. The constraint on the y-dimension, supy(x) <= infy(z), contradicts our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) (unless supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a very specific case and not guaranteed). So, in general, SW is not a consistent relation.

N: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
The constraint on the y-dimension, supy(z) <= infy(x), contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) <= supy(z) (unless supy(z) = infy(x), which is a very specific case). So, in general, N is not a consistent relation.

S: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
The constraint on the y-dimension, supy(x) <= infy(z), contradicts our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) (unless supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a very specific case and not guaranteed). So, in general, S is not a consistent relation.

E: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
The constraints on the y-dimension are already satisfied. But the constraint on the x-dimension, supx(z) <= infx(x), contradicts our derived constraints (since supx(y) <= supx(z) from y B z, and supx(x) <= infx(y) from x W y, which means supx(x) <= supx(z)). So, E is not a consistent relation.

NE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
The constraint on the x-dimension contradicts our derived constraints, as explained for E. Additionally, the constraint on the y-dimension, supy(z) <= infy(x), contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) <= supy(z) (unless supy(z) = infy(x), which is a very specific case). So, NE is not a consistent relation.

SE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
The constraint on the x-dimension contradicts our derived constraints, as explained for E. Additionally, the constraint on the y-dimension, supy(x) <= infy(z), contradicts our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) (unless supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a very specific case and not guaranteed). So, SE is not a consistent relation.

B: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
The constraints on the y-dimension are already satisfied. The second constraint on the x-dimension, supx(x) <= supx(z), is also satisfied (derivation provided in the E relation). But the first constraint, infx(z) <= infx(x), needs to be checked against our derived constraints.

We've established that supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z). If infx(z) <= infx(x), then we have infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y). This means that both infx(z) and infx(x) are less than infx(y), but we can't determine their order relative to each other.

So, if infx(z) > infx(x), then B is not a consistent relation. But if infx(z) <= infx(x), then B is a possible relation. This corresponds to case 3 (infx(z) < supx(x)).

Let's double-check our conclusions:

- For W: We need supx(x) <= infx(z). This is satisfied in cases 1 and 2. So, W is a possible relation.
- For B: We need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). All constraints are satisfied in case 3 (assuming infx(z) <= infx(x)). So, B is a possible relation.

I'm not sure if there's a contradiction here, or if we have to be more careful about the possible cases.

Given that we've derived the constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (from y B z and x W y)
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

It seems that the possible relations between x and z could be:

1. W: If supx(x) <= infx(z). In this case, x is to the west of z.
2. B: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (which may or may not be satisfied depending on the specific coordinates). In this case, x is inside the bounding box of z.

I realize I'm going in circles. Let me try with a different approach.

Actually, without specific coordinate values, it's problematic to say that infx(z) <= infx(x) (as required for B), especially given that supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z). These don't directly tell us anything about the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x).

Actually, let me try to understand the problem differently:

The cardinal directions (N, S, E, W, etc.) describe the relationship between two regions in a 2D space based on their bounding boxes. 

Let's illustrate the constraints visually:

```
     z
  +------+
  |      |
  |      |
  |  +--+|
  |  |y ||
  |  +--+|
  |      |
  +------+

x
+--+
|  |
+--+
```

In this diagram, x is W of y, and y is B of z. Visually, x seems to be W of z.

Let's analyze:

From x W y:
- x is to the west of y (supx(x) <= infx(y))
- x's y-projection overlaps with y's y-projection.

From y B z:
- y is inside the bounding box of z.

For x to be W of z, x should be to the west of z and their y-projections should overlap. Given that y is inside z, and x is to the west of y with overlapping y-projections, it makes sense that x would also be to the west of z (since z extends beyond y).

But, I'm still uncertain if "W" is the only possible relation between x and z. Let's say w we have the case where x is west of y, and y is near the west edge of z. In this scenario, x could potentially still overlap with z, making the relation between x and z "B" (bounding box).

OK, I think I've been overcomplicating this problem. 

Let's approach it straightforwardly:

If region x is W of region y, it means:
- x is to the west of y (supx(x) <= infx(y))
- x's y-projection overlaps with y's y-projection.

If region y is B of region z, it means:
- y is inside the bounding box of z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relation between x and z? 

Well, since y is inside z, x remains to the west of z. And since x's y-projection overlaps with y's y-projection, which is inside z's y-projection, x's y-projection also overlaps with z's y-projection. This would make the relation between x and z "W".

Actually, I'm forgetting that the regions can be arbitrary shapes. The cardinal directions (N, S, E, W, etc.) are defined in terms of the projections of the region on the x and y axes.

Once more Hmm, I'm missing something that's making me go in logical circles. 

We know:
1. x W y, which means supx(x) <= infx(y) and their y-projections overlap.
2. y B z, which means y is entirely inside the bounding box of z.

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's refer back to the definitions from the problem:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Given x W y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

Given y B z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we derive:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The second and third conditions are already satisfied. The first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), isn't guaranteed by our derived constraints. We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but we can't determine the exact relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

If infx(z) <= supx(x), then x couldn't be W of z. In this case, x would overlap with z in the x-dimension.

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The last two conditions are already satisfied. The second condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), is also satisfied because supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) (by definition) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z). Combining these, we get supx(x) <= supx(z).

However, the first condition, infx(z) <= infx(x), isn't guaranteed by our derived constraints.

Hmm, I'm again going in circles. Let's approach this problem purely from a logical standpoint.

Let's see if the relation between x and z can be any of the cardinal directions:

1. W (West): For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints. If we can have a scenario where supx(x) <= infx(z) holds, then W is a possible relation.

2. B (Bounding Box): For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last three conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints. If we can have a scenario where infx(z) <= infx(x) holds, then B is a possible relation.

3. NW (Northwest): For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The second condition contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) <= supy(z). So, NW is not a possible relation.

4. E (East): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The second and third conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints. But the first condition conflicts with supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) (by definition) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z), which gives us supx(x) <= supx(z) (the opposite of what's needed for E). So, E is not a possible relation.

5. NE (Northeast): For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both conditions conflict with our derived constraints. So, NE is not a possible relation.

6. SW (Southwest): For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition can be satisfied (as we discussed for W). But the second condition conflicts with our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). So, SW is not a possible relation.

7. SE (Southeast): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both conditions conflict with our derived constraints. So, SE is not a possible relation.

8. N (North): For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The last condition is satisfied by our derived constraints. The second condition can potentially be satisfied (as we discussed for B). But the first condition conflicts with our derived constraint supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). So, N is not a possible relation.

9. S (South): For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The last two conditions can potentially be satisfied (as we discussed for B). But the first condition conflicts with our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). So, S is not a possible relation.

Given this analysis, W and B are the only possible relations between x and z, depending on the specific coordinates. However, I'm still not entirely confident in this conclusion. Let's double-check by considering concrete examples.

Example 1: x is W of z

Assume:
- infx(z) = 10
- supx(x) = 8
- infy(z) = 5
- infy(x) = 6
- supy(x) = 9
- supy(z) = 15

With these coordinates, we have supx(x) <= infx(z) (8 <= 10), infy(z) <= infy(x) (5 <= 6), and supy(x) <= supy(z) (9 <= 15). So, x is W of z. And if we introduce a region y such that infx(y) = 12, infy(y) = 6, and supy(y) = 10, then x is W of y and y is B of z.

Example 2: x is B of z

Assume:
- infx(z) = 5
- infx(x) = 7
- supx(x) = 12
- supx(z) = 20
- infy(z) = 5
- infy(x) = 7
- supy(x) = 10
- supy(z) = 15

With these coordinates, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) (5 <= 7), supx(x) <= supx(z) (12 <= 20), infy(z) <= infy(x) (5 <= 7), and supy(x) <= supy(z) (10 <= 15). So, x is B of z. And if we introduce a region y such that infx(y) = 12, infy(y) = 7, and supy(y) = 11, then x is W of y (assuming supx(x) = 12 and infx(y) = 12) and y is B of z.

These examples confirm that both W and B are possible relations between x and z. Let me now try one more example to ensure the two are the only possible relations.

Example 3: x is not W or B of z (let's try to make x SW of z)

For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

Assume:
- supx(x) = 5
- infx(z) = 10
- supy(x) = 5
- infy(z) = 10

With these coordinates, x is SW of z.

But for x to be W of y, we also need:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

And for y to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these two, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).

But for x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), which conflicts with infy(z) <= infy(x). So, it's impossible for x to be SW of z.

These examples further support the conclusion that the only possible relations between x and z are W and B.

Based on the above analysis, I'm confident that the possible relations between region x and region z, given that region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, are:

1. W (West)
2. B (Bounding Box)

Let me double-check my math one more time. Actually, you know what, I think I overanalyzed the situation. I'll just go with the answer: W, B.

Wait, let me try once more to falsify this answer.

The constraints:
- x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we derive:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) [From y B z and x W y]
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) [From x W y and y B z]
- supx(x) <= infx(y) [From x W y]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [From y B z]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [From y B z]

Let's check if x can be in each of these relations with z:

W: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
We've derived infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If x is far to the west of y and z is also far to the west of y, it's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is a possible relation.

NW: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
We've derived supy(x) <= supy(z), which is the opposite of what's needed (supy(z) <= infy(x)) for NW. So, NW is not a possible relation.

N: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
Again, the constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) conflicts with our derived constraint supy(x) <= supy(z). So, N is not a possible relation.

NE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
The constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) conflicts with our derived constraint. Additionally, given that supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (combining the constraints), we have supx(x) <= supx(z), which is the opposite of what's needed (supx(z) <= infx(x)). So, NE is not a possible relation.

E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
We've derived infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). However, the first constraint, supx(z) <= infx(x), conflicts with our derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z). So, E is not a possible relation.

SE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
The first constraint conflicts with our derived constraint. Additionally, the second constraint, supy(x) <= infy(z), conflicts with our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). So, SE is not a possible relation.

S: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
The first constraint, supy(x) <= infy(z), conflicts with our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). So, S is not a possible relation.

SW: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
The second constraint, supy(x) <= infy(z), conflicts with our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). So, SW is not a possible relation.

B: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
We've derived infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've also derived supx(x) <= supx(z). If infx(z) <= infx(x) (which is independent of our current constraints), then B is a possible relation.

Based on this comprehensive analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are:

1. W (West): If supx(x) <= infx(z).
2. B (Bounding Box): If infx(z) <= infx(x).

Given that both of these conditions can be satisfied depending on the specific coordinates, the answer should be W, B.

Actually, wait, I want to double-check a specific case.

Can region x be a combo of directions with z? For example, can x be both "W" and "B" of z?

By definition:
- x W z means supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
- x B z means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).

If x is both W and B of z, then both sets of constraints would apply. But the constraints supx(x) <= infx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) can only be simultaneously satisfied if infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z), which is a very specific case (e.g., if x is a straight line). So, in general, x can't simultaneously be W and B of z. The relation should depend on the specific coordinates, and the answer should be "W or B, but not both."

Actually, wait, the relations are supposed to be mutually exclusive. So the relation should be one of "W" or "B" depending on the coordinates, not both.

Actually, let's double-check the 9 single-tile cardinal direction relations:
B: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
S: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
SW: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
NW: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
N: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
NE: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
E: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
SE: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)

with our reasoning above, a region x can be W or B of region z, given that region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z.

OK, now let's check each direction one by one:

W: In our derivation, we derived infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then for x W z to be true, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). All of these conditions are satisfied, so x can be W of z.

B: In our derivation, we derived infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z), and supx(x) <= supx(z). If infx(z) <= infx(x), then for x B z to be true, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). All of these conditions are satisfied, so x can be B of z.

NW: For x NW z to be true, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). However, we derived supy(x) <= supy(z), which conflicts with the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) (unless supy(z) = infy(x), which is a very specific case). So, in general, x cannot be NW of z.

N: For x N z to be true, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). However, we derived supy(x) <= supy(z), which conflicts with the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) (unless supy(z) = infy(x), which is a very specific case). So, in general, x cannot be N of z.

NE: For x NE z to be true, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). However, we derived supx(x) <= supx(z), which conflicts with the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless supx(z) = infx(x), which is a very specific case). Also, we derived supy(x) <= supy(z), which conflicts with the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) (unless supy(z) = infy(x), which is a very specific case). So, in general, x cannot be NE of z.

E: For x E z to be true, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). However, we derived supx(x) <= supx(z), which conflicts with the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless supx(z) = infx(x), which is a very specific case). So, in general, x cannot be E of z.

SE: For x SE z to be true, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). However, we derived supx(x) <= supx(z), which conflicts with the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless supx(z) = infx(x), which is a very specific case). Also, we derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which conflicts with the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) (unless supy(x) = infy(x) and infy(x) = infy(z), which is a very specific case). So, in general, x cannot be SE of z.

S: For x S z to be true, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). However, we derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which conflicts with the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) (unless supy(x) = infy(x) and infy(x) = infy(z), which is a very specific case). So, in general, x cannot be S of z.

SW: For x SW z to be true, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). However, we derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which conflicts with the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) (unless supy(x) = infy(x) and infy(x) = infy(z), which is a very specific case). So, in general, x cannot be SW of z.

Actually, I'm making the analysis too complicated. 

1. W: For x W z to be true, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The latter two are satisfied based on our derivation. So, if supx(x) <= infx(z) is also satisfied (which can be true for some specific coordinates), x can be W of z.

2. B: For x B z to be true, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last three are satisfied based on our derivation. So, if infx(z) <= infx(x) is also satisfied (which can be true for some specific coordinates), x can be B of z.

3. For all other cardinal directions, various conditions conflict with our derived constraints. So, for general, unconstrained spatial layouts, x can only be W or B of z.

Final answer.
W, B

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z when:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is B of region z

Let me analyze the constraints systematically:

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom is below or at x's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is below or at y's top)

From y B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z's left boundary is to the left of y's left boundary)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's bottom is below or at y's bottom)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's top is below or at z's top)

Combining these constraints:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)

Now checking possible relations:

1. W: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is west of z. The y-dimension constraints (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) are already satisfied from our derivation.

2. B: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is in the bounding box of z. The last three conditions are satisfied based on our derivation.

Other cardinal directions create contradictions with our derived constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: W, B
