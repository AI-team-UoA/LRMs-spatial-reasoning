PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's use the definitions provided to reason about this problem.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is B of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definition of E (East):
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, x E y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)  (x's lower y-bound is at or above y's lower y-bound)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)  (x's upper y-bound is at or below y's upper y-bound)

Next, let's recall the definition of B (bounding box):
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, y B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)  (y's left boundary is at or to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y's right boundary is at or to the left of z's right boundary)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (y's lower boundary is at or above z's lower boundary)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y's upper boundary is at or below z's upper boundary)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of y)

From y B z, we know:
- supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y's right boundary is at or to the left of z's right boundary)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)  (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)  (from y B z)

This means supx(y) is less than or equal to both infx(x) and supx(z). But we can't immediately determine the order between infx(x) and supx(z). 

If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is to the east of z, which means x could be in relation E, NE, or SE with z.

If infx(x) <= supx(z), then x and z might overlap in the x-dimension. We need to check the y-dimension.

From x E y, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)  (x's lower y-bound is at or above y's lower y-bound)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)  (x's upper y-bound is at or below y's upper y-bound)

From y B z, we know:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (y's lower boundary is at or above z's lower boundary)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y's upper boundary is at or below z's upper boundary)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)  (implying infy(z) <= infy(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)  (implying supy(x) <= supy(z))

This means x is vertically within the bounds of z.

Now, based on all these constraints, let's determine the possible cardinal directions for the relation between x and z:

1. E (East): If supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We've shown above that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). So, if supx(z) <= infx(x), then x E z.

2. NE (North East): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   We've shown that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), but we don't have a direct comparison between supy(z) and infy(x). There are cases where supy(z) <= infy(x), making NE possible.

3. SE (South East): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We've shown that supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), but we don't have a direct comparison between supy(x) and infy(z). There are cases where supy(x) <= infy(z), making SE possible.

4. B (Bounding Box): If infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We've shown that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If, in addition, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x B z.

Hmm, let's try to reason more carefully. We need to figure out which of the above conditions can be satisfied given the original constraints.

From our constraints, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)  (from x E y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)  (from y B z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)  (from y B z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (from y B z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)  (from x E y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)  (from x E y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (from y B z)

Let's consider each possible cardinal direction:

1. E (East): For x E z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've shown that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), we have supx(y) <= infx(x) from x E y, but we only know supx(y) <= supx(z) from y B z. Thus, we can't guarantee that supx(z) <= infx(x). So, E is a possible but not necessary relation.

2. NE (North East): For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), as discussed above, it's a possible relation.
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), we have supy(y) <= supy(z) from y B z, and infy(y) <= infy(x) from x E y. But there's no direct relation between supy(z) and infy(x). So, NE is a possible but not necessary relation.

3. SE (South East): For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), as discussed above, it's a possible relation.
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we have supy(x) <= supy(y) from x E y, and infy(z) <= infy(y) from y B z. But there's no direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z). So, SE is a possible but not necessary relation.

4. B (Bounding Box): For x B z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've shown that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) from y B z, but we don't have a direct relation between infx(y) and infx(x) (we only know supx(y) <= infx(x)). So, we can't guarantee infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we have no direct constraints linking these values. So, we can't guarantee supx(x) <= supx(z).
   Thus, B is a possible but not necessary relation.

I need to think more carefully about this. Let's re-examine the constraints.

From x E y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's lower y-bound is at or below x's lower y-bound)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's upper y-bound is at or below y's upper y-bound)

From y B z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's left boundary is at or to the left of y's left boundary)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right boundary is at or to the left of z's right boundary)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's lower boundary is at or below y's lower boundary)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's upper boundary is at or below z's upper boundary)

Now, let's think about the possible configurations for regions x, y, and z:

Since x is E of y, it means x is completely to the east (right) of y. And since y is B of z, it means y is completely within the boundaries of z. 

This means z's boundaries are at least as inclusive as y's boundaries. Given that x is to the east of y, and y is within z, here are some possible scenarios for x relative to z:

1. x is entirely to the east of z (E relation).
2. x is to the northeast of z (NE relation).
3. x is to the southeast of z (SE relation).
4. x is within the boundaries of z (B relation).
5. x is to the north of z (N relation).
6. x is to the south of z (S relation).

Let's check each of these:

1. E (East): 
   For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within z). Combining these, we just have supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), but we don't have a direct comparison between supx(z) and infx(x). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the east of z. But if infx(x) < supx(z), then x might overlap with z in the x-dimension, so E is not the only possible relation.

2. NE (North East):
   For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z). We've already discussed the possibility of supx(z) <= infx(x). For the second condition, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z). But we can't directly compare supy(z) and infy(x). If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is to the northeast of z. But we can't guarantee this, so NE is not the only possible relation.

3. SE (South East):
   For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z). For the second condition, we know supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z). But we can't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z). If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is to the southeast of z. But we can't guarantee this, so SE is not the only possible relation.

Wait, I think I've been approaching this incorrectly. Let's draw out some scenarios:

1. Imagine y is a square within a larger square z, with the left, top, and bottom boundaries of y touching the corresponding boundaries of z. Region x is a square to the right of y. Depending on the height and position of x, it can be either entirely inside z (B relation) or partially outside (E, NE, or SE relation).

2. Imagine y is a small square in the center of a larger square z. Region x is a square to the right of y. Depending on the size and position of x, it can be entirely inside z (B relation), entirely outside (E, NE, or SE relation), or partially inside/outside.

It seems I need to consider all possible relations. Let's systematically check each of the 9 cardinal directions to determine which ones are possible for the relation between x and z.

1. B (Bounding Box):
   For x B z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From our constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Similarly, supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), we know infx(z) <= infx(y) from y B z, but we don't have a direct relation between infx(y) and infx(x).
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints.

   However, I can create a scenario where x B z: Imagine y is a square within z, with the left boundary of y touching the left boundary of z. Region x is a square to the right of y but entirely within z. In this case, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are both satisfied, making x B z.

2. S (South):
   For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   
   I'll try to create a scenario: Imagine z is a rectangle where its lower part is occupied by y, and its upper part is empty. Region x is below z. This means supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y), but the lower boundary of x is below the lower boundary of z, i.e., supy(x) <= infy(z). This doesn't satisfy the constraints that y is B of z. since y is partially outside of z. 

   Let me try again: Imagine z is a rectangle, and y is a smaller rectangle fully within z. Now, place x to the right of y but below z. This satisfies x E y and y B z, and results in x S z. So, S is a possible relation.

Hmm, I'm not sure the above is right, since for y B z, y must be completely inside z. Let me try to draw simple 1D projections to clarify.

For x-axis, with left to right orientation:
- z: [---------------------]
- y: [---]   (somewhere inside z)
- x:     [---]   (to the right of y)

For y-axis, with bottom to top orientation:
- z: [---------------------]
- y: [---]   (somewhere inside z)
- x: [---]   (can be at various vertical positions relative to y and z)

From this, we can see that x might be partially or fully within z in the x-dimension, and it can be at various vertical positions.

For B relation between x and z, x should be fully inside z in both dimensions. This is possible if x is not too far to the right and if its vertical position is fully within z.

For S relation between x and z, x should be below z and horizontally within z. Looking at our constraints, is this possible? x is to the east of y, and y is fully within z. If y is positioned at the bottom of z, then x won't be below z.

But what about other scenarios? I think the constraint of y B z and x E y actually gives us more flexibility than I initially thought. It means y is within z, and x is to the east of y, but nothing forces x to be within or outside of z.

Let me re-evaluate each cardinal direction systematically:

1. B (Bounding Box):
   This is possible if x is fully within z. This can happen if y is positioned such that there's still space to the east of y within z, and x fits within that space.

2. S (South):
   For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). Given our constraints, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) unless supy(x) = infy(x) and infy(x) = infy(z). But this would make x a line with no area, which contradicts the definition of regions in REG. Hence, S is not a possible relation.

3. SW (South West):
   For x SW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). 
   From our constraints, supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is within z). Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), which doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(x) and infx(z).
   Similarly, for the vertical constraint, as we saw with S, the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our given constraints.
   Hence, SW is not a possible relation.

4. W (West):
   For x W z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From our constraints, supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is within z). Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), but we can't directly determine the order between supx(x) and infx(z).
   For the vertical constraints, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which satisfies infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   The key constraint to check is whether supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible. But given that x is to the east of y and y is fully within z, it seems like x would be to the east (or overlap with) z, not to the west. So, W is not a possible relation.

5. NW (North West):
   For x NW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Similar to the reasoning for W, the horizontal constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts our given constraints. Hence, NW is not a possible relation.

6. N (North):
   For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From our constraints, supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is within z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the east of y). But we don't have a direct relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
   
   Given that y is fully within z and x is to the east of y, we need to check if x can be to the north of z. If z extends far enough vertically, and x is placed high enough, then x could be above z, making N a possible relation.

7. NE (North East):
   For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   From our constraints, supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within z), which doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
   
   Given that y is fully within z and x is to the east of y, we need to check if x can be to the northeast of z. If z has limited horizontal and vertical extents, and x is placed far enough to the east and north, then x could be to the northeast of z, making NE a possible relation.

8. E (East):
   For x E z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From our constraints, we've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   Given that y is fully within z and x is to the east of y, if z has limited horizontal extent, and x is placed far enough to the east, then x could be to the east of z, making E a possible relation.

9. SE (South East):
   For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Similar to the reasoning for S, the vertical constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our given constraints. Hence, SE is not a possible relation.

Let me double-check the constraints I think are contradictory:

For the S, SW, and SE relations, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y). Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(x). We also have supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y).

Wait, I think I've been making a mistake. The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) means the top of x is below the bottom of z. Given our constraints, we can't directly determine the order between supy(x) and infy(z). We have supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z), but we can't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z).

Let me re-evaluate the S, SW, and SE relations:

1. S (South):
   For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From our given constraints, infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y), which means infy(z) <= infy(x). This is the bottom of z is below or at the bottom of x.
   But for S, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) (the top of x is below or at the bottom of z). If infy(z) <= infy(x), and regions are non-empty (they have positive height), then we have infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), which means we can't satisfy supy(x) <= infy(z). So S is not a possible relation.

Actually, I think my mistake is that I'm not properly considering what the y-axis constraints from E and B mean.

From x E y, we have:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's lower y-bound is at or above y's lower y-bound)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's upper y-bound is at or below y's upper y-bound)

This means that x is vertically contained within y, and horizontally to the east of y.

From y B z, we have:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's lower boundary is at or above z's lower boundary)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's upper boundary is at or below z's upper boundary)

This means that y is completely contained within z.

Given these constraints, here are the possible cardinal directions for the relation between x and z:

1. B (Bounding Box):
   If x is vertically contained within y, and y is fully contained within z, and if x is also horizontally contained within z, then x B z. This is possible.

2. E (East):
   If x is to the east of y, and y is fully contained within z, if z doesn't extend far enough to the east, then x can be to the east of z, making E a possible relation.

Let me switch to thinking about specific examples to clarify:

Imagine z is a large rectangle, and y is a smaller rectangle in the center of z. Now, place x to the right of y.

If x is still within the boundaries of z, then x B z.
If x extends beyond the right boundary of z, then x E z (since we've already established that x is vertically contained within y, which is vertically contained within z).

Given that x is vertically contained within y, and y is vertically contained within z, the only possible vertical relationships between x and z are that x is vertically contained within z.

Horizontally, if x extends beyond the right boundary of z, then x E z. Otherwise, x is horizontally contained within z, and the relation is x B z.

Now, let me think even more systematically. 

Given:
- Region x is E of region y (x is to the east of y)
- Region y is B of region z (y is fully contained within z)

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

For x E y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's lower y-bound is at or above y's lower y-bound)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's upper y-bound is at or below y's upper y-bound)

For y B z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left boundary is at or to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right boundary is at or to the left of z's right boundary)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's lower boundary is at or above z's lower boundary)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's upper boundary is at or below z's upper boundary)

Combining these constraints, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (but we don't have a direct comparison between infx(z) and infx(x))
- supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (but we don't have a direct comparison between supx(z) and infx(x))
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (which implies infy(z) <= infy(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (which implies supy(x) <= supy(z))

The last two constraints tell us that the vertical extent of x is within the vertical extent of z, i.e., x is vertically contained within z. 

For the horizontal constraints, we have various possibilities based on the relative positions of x and z. Let's check each of the 9 cardinal directions and see which ones are consistent with our constraints:

1. B (Bounding Box): For x B z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) from our combined constraints.
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), we know infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z), but we need to compare infx(y) and infx(x). From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), but there's no direct constraint for infx(y) and infx(x). It's possible that infx(y) <= infx(x), which would make infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we know supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z), but there's no direct constraint for supx(x) and supx(y) or supx(z). It's possible that supx(x) <= supx(z).

   Given the flexibility in our constraints, B is a possible relation between x and z.

2. S (South): For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've established that infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom of z is at or below the bottom of x.
   - For S, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the top of x is at or below the bottom of z.
   - But these two constraints together give us: infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which is only possible if infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). But this would make x have zero height, which contradicts our definition of regions.

   So, S is not a possible relation between x and z.

3. SW (South West): For x SW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Similar to the reasoning for S, the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our established constraints. So, SW is not a possible relation.

4. W (West): For x W z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), we combine our constraints: supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z). Transitively, this would mean infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). But we can't guarantee supx(x) <= infx(z) from our given constraints. In fact, it's hard to imagine x being to the west of z if x is to the east of y and y is fully contained within z.

   So, W is not a possible relation between x and z.

5. NW (North West): For x NW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - From our established constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - But, similar to the reasoning for W, it's hard to justify supx(x) <= infx(z) given our constraints.

   So, NW is not a possible relation between x and z.

6. N (North): For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've established that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
   - For N, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But from our constraints, we also have supy(y) <= supy(z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(y). This gives us infy(x) < supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x).

   So, N is not a possible relation between x and z.

Wait, I think I've been overthinking, and x can only be E, NE, SE, or B with respect to z.

Let's simplify. Since y B z (y is fully contained within z), the area of z entirely covers the area of y. Since x E y (x is to the east of y), the area of x is entirely to the east of the area of y.

Now, since z entirely covers y, and x is to the east of y, based on how far z extends to the east (beyond y), and how high or low x is, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. B (Bounding Box): If z extends far enough to the east to fully contain x.
2. E (East): If z doesn't extend far enough to the east, so x extends beyond the right boundary of z, and the vertical extent of x is fully within the vertical extent of z.
3. NE (North East): If z doesn't extend far enough to the east or high enough, so x extends beyond the right and upper boundaries of z.
4. SE (South East): If z doesn't extend far enough to the east or low enough, so x extends beyond the right and lower boundaries of z.

Wait, I don't think that NE or SE can be possible. Since y B z and x E y, the vertical extent of x is contained within the vertical extent of y, which is contained within the vertical extent of z. This means the vertical extent of x is fully contained within the vertical extent of z.

So, only B and E are the possible relations between x and z.

Wait, I think I've been mistaken about the E relation. Let's recall the definition:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, x E y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's lower y-bound is at or above y's lower y-bound)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's upper y-bound is at or below y's upper y-bound)

The third condition, supy(x) <= supy(y), means the upper y-bound of x is at or below the upper y-bound of y. Along with infy(y) <= infy(x), this means x is vertically somewhere within the y extent. This does not mean the vertical extent of x is fully contained within the vertical extent of y. 

Let me double-check this. If infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y), it means the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y, and the top of x is at or below the top of y. This actually does mean that the vertical extent of x is fully contained within the vertical extent of y.

Extending this logic, since y B z, the vertical extent of y is fully contained within the vertical extent of z. Thus, the vertical extent of x is also fully contained within the vertical extent of z.

So, if the vertical extent of x is fully contained within the vertical extent of z (i.e., infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)), the only possible relations between x and z are B or E, based on whether x is horizontally to the east of z or within it.

For B (Bounding Box), we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) from our combined constraints.
- For infx(z) <= infx(x), we know infx(z) <= infx(y) from y B z, but we don't have a direct relation between infx(y) and infx(x). 
- For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints.

But if z extends far enough to the east to fully contain x, then both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) would be satisfied, making B a possible relation.

For E (East), we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- For supx(z) <= infx(x), we combine our constraints: supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z). This gives us supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)), but we can't directly determine the order between infx(x) and supx(z).

If z doesn't extend far enough to the east, so supx(z) <= infx(x), then E is a possible relation.

It looks like B and E are the only possible relations between x and z.

Actually, wait. Let's think about this more carefully.

1. We established that the vertical extent of x is fully contained within the vertical extent of z due to the transitive containment: x is vertically contained in y, and y is vertically contained in z.

2. For the horizontal dimension, since x E y (x is to the east of y) and y B z (y is fully within z), two things can happen:
   - If z doesn't extend far enough to the east (beyond y), then x (or a part of it) will be to the east of z: E or NE or SE relation.
   - If z extends far enough to the east to fully contain x, then x will be fully contained within z: B relation.

But we've already established that the vertical extent of x is fully contained within the vertical extent of z, which eliminated the NE and SE relations. 

So, based on whether z extends far enough to the east to fully contain x or not, the possible relations are B or E.

Hmm, I'm just not confident enough the way I've approached this, since I keep going back and forth. Let me try with a concrete example.

Given constraints:
1. Region x is E of region y
2. Region y is B of region z

For simplicity, let's consider rectangles with specific dimensions.

Let's say:
- z = [0,10] x [0,10] (width 10, height 10)
- y = [2,4] x [2,4] (width 2, height 2, fully contained within z)
- x = [5,6] x [2,3] (width 1, height 1, to the east of y)

With these dimensions:
- x is to the east of y (satisfying the first constraint)
- y is fully contained within z (satisfying the second constraint)
- x is fully contained within z, so the relationship between x and z is B.

Now, if I adjust x to be [11,12] x [2,3], then:
- x is to the east of y (satisfying the first constraint)
- y is fully contained within z (satisfying the second constraint)
- x is to the east of z, so the relationship between x and z is E.

Hmm, let's go back to the constraints and see if we can derive other examples where x has a different relation to z.

For y to be B of z, y must be fully contained within z.
For x to be E of y, x must be to the east of y and vertically overlapped with y.

The relation between x and z depends on where z's boundaries are relative to x and y.

Give that y is fully contained within z, I can make x have relations B, E, NE, or SE with z based on where I place z's boundaries.

If z barely contains y (i.e., z's boundaries are almost the same as y's), then x will be to the east of z, resulting in E relation.

If z extends far beyond y to the east, north, and south, but not to the west, then x will be fully contained within z, resulting in B relation.

If z extends far to the east but not much to the north of y, then x can be to the northeast of z, resulting in NE relation.

If z extends far to the east but not much to the south of y, then x can be to the southeast of z, resulting in SE relation.

Actually, I'm getting confused again. Let me revisit the definitions:

For x E y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's lower y-bound is at or above y's lower y-bound)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's upper y-bound is at or below y's upper y-bound)

The vertical constraints (infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)) mean that x is vertically somewhere within y's extent, but not necessarily fully within. It allows for scenarios where:
- The bottom of x is higher than the bottom of y and the top of x is lower than the top of y (x is fully within y vertically).
- The bottom of x is the same as the bottom of y and the top of x is lower than the top of y (x's vertical extent starts from the same point as y but ends earlier).
- The bottom of x is higher than the bottom of y and the top of x is the same as the top of y (x's vertical extent starts after y but ends at the same point).
- The bottom of x is the same as the bottom of y and the top of x is the same as the top of y (x and y have the same vertical extent).

Hmm, this is making me rethink my earlier conclusions.

OK, I've been overthinking. Let's break this down. 

x E y, which means x is to the east of y. This implies:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y).
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is at or below the top of y).

Simply, this means the vertical extent of x is somewhere within the vertical extent of y, though not necessarily fully within.

Now, y B z, which means y is fully contained within z. This implies:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left of y is at or to the right of the left of z).
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right of y is at or to the left of the right of z).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (the bottom of y is at or above the bottom of z).
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (the top of y is at or below the top of z).

So, y is fully contained within z.

Given x E y:
- x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x).
- x's vertical extent is somewhere within y's vertical extent: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).

Given y B z:
- y is to the east of z's western edge: infx(z) <= infx(y).
- y is to the west of z's eastern edge: supx(y) <= supx(z).
- y's bottom is at or above z's bottom: infy(z) <= infy(y).
- y's top is at or below z's top: supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining, we get:
1. infx(z) <= infx(y)
2. supx(y) <= supx(z)
3. infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
4. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, the vertical extent of x is somewhere within the vertical extent of z (specifically, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)).

If x is horizontally contained within z (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)), then x B z.
If x is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), then x E z.

These are the two main possibilities.

Actually, wait a minute. 

If x E y, which means supx(y) <= infx(x), then the relation between x and z depends on the relative positions of infx(x) and supx(z):

If infx(x) <= supx(z), there's potential horizontal overlap between x and z. And since infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), x's vertical extent is contained within z's. 

If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x B z.
If infx(x) < infx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which is not a single-tile cardinal direction relation.
If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(z) < supx(x), which is not a single-tile cardinal direction relation.
If infx(x) < infx(z) and supx(z) < supx(x), which is not a single-tile cardinal direction relation.
We also would have to consider potential partial overlaps in the vertical dimension as well. But all of these would not be single-tile cardinal direction relations, and the vertical containment ensures we don't have N, NW, W, SW, or S relations.

If supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z, and given the vertical containment, x E z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are B and E.

OK final check, the possible relations are B and E, double-checking our work:

For B: We need x entirely inside z.
- Can x be entirely inside z, given the problem constraints? YES. We can have x overlap with z if x doesn't extend beyond the right boundary of z. Since x is to the east of y and y is fully contained within z, x can be entirely inside z if z extends far enough to the east.

For E: We need x entirely to the east of z, but vertically constrained within the extents of z.
- Can x be entirely to the east of z, given the problem constraints? YES. Since x is to the east of y, it can be to the east of z if z doesn't extend far enough to the east or if y is near z's right boundary.

Alright, we've confirmed both B and E are possible relations for x and z. Let's also check if any other cardinal directions could apply:

For N: We need x entirely to the north of z, but horizontally constrained within the extents of z.
- Can x be entirely to the north of z, given the problem constraints? NO. Since y is fully contained within z and x's vertical extent is contained within y's, which is contained within z's, x cannot be entirely to the north of z. 

For NE: We need x entirely to the northeast of z. 
- Can x be entirely to the northeast of z, given the problem constraints? NO. While x could potentially be to the east of z, its vertical extent is contained within z's, so it can't be entirely to the north of z. Same reasoning as for N.

For SE: We need x entirely to the southeast of z. 
- Can x be entirely to the southeast of z, given the problem constraints? NO. Similar to above, while x could potentially be to the east of z, its vertical extent is constrained by z's, so it can't be entirely to the south of z. 

For S, SW, W, and NW, similarly, the vertical and/or horizontal constraints on x relative to z prevent these relations.

So, the possible relations between x and z are indeed B and E.

Actually, I still don't think I got the definition of the E direction right. Let me double check using the definition again:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, for x E z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is at or below the top of z)

From our combined constraints, we've established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which means x's vertical extent is contained within z's.

For supx(z) <= infx(x), we have:
- From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- From y B z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right of y is at or to the left of the right of z)

Combining these, we get supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)), but we still don't have a direct relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). 

If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x would be to the east of z, and the relationship would be x E z.

If infx(x) < supx(z), there's potential horizontal overlap, and with the vertical containment we've established, the relationship could be x B z (if x is fully contained within z).

There's also a possibility of there not being a tiling cardinal relationship, if there's a partial horizontal overlap. But this isn't among the choices given to us.

Given the problem statement, I think the relationship between x and z is either E (if x is entirely to the east of z) or B (if x is entirely contained within z), based on the relative positions of x, y, and z.


Actually, I've missed something super important in the problem description. 

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

What this means is a region can be made up of multiple areas, with each area having a single cardinal relationship to a referecen region. So the possible relation between x and z can be a multi-tile cardinal direction expression if the two regions overlap in more complex way.

But after spending a lot of time thinking about the problem, I've concluded that given our constraints, x E y (x is to the east of y) and y B z (y is fully contained within z), we've established that:

1. infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z)
2. supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is at or below the top of z)

This means x's vertical extent is contained within z's.

The horizontal relationship depends on the relative position of x's left edge (infx(x)) to z's right edge (supx(z)):

If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the east of z, and the relationship is x E z.
If infx(x) < supx(z), and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is fully contained within z, and the relationship is x B z.
if infx(x) < supx(z) but not both of the conditions above, then x has a partial overlap with z, which doesn't fall into the simple single-tile cardinal directions.

Hmm, actually, I think I got confused by the problem statement. When it's talking about multi-tile cardinal relations, I think that's for regions that can be decomposed into multiple regions.

Since the possible answer can be one or many of the basic cardinal directions, I'm sticking to my conclusion that the possible relations are B and E.

Actually, there may be more I'm missing. Let me revisit the directions once more.

x E y, which means x is to the east of y. This implies:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y).
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is at or below the top of y).

I suddenly realized I may be mistaken. The fact that infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) doesn't necessarily place x completely within y's vertical extent. It just means there's a vertical range in which both regions exist. 

Actually, I think the above describes the relationship correctly. Let's explicitly walk through what the constraints mean:

For x E y to be true, we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is at or below the top of y)

Combining the last two constraints, infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y). This means x's vertical extent is contained within y's. So my reasoning was actually correct, despite what I just said. The region x is to the east of y and its vertical extent is within y.

If we have y B z, then y is fully contained within z:
1. infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left of y is at or to the right of the left of z)
2. supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right of y is at or to the left of the right of z)
3. infy(z) <= infy(y) (the bottom of y is at or above the bottom of z)
4. supy(y) <= supy(z) (the top of y is at or below the top of z)

Combining all constraints, we get:
1. infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
2. supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
3. supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y B z and x E y)
5. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from x E y and y B z)

From 4 and 5, we know that x's vertical extent is within z's extent: infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z).

From 1, 2, and 3, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), and supx(y) <= infx(x), but we don't have a direct relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). So, we have two possibilities:

1. If infx(x) <= supx(z), there could be horizontal overlap, and given the vertical containment, the relation could be B.
2. If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is to the east of z, and the relation is E.

So, the possible relations are B or E.

Final answer: The possible relations between x and z are B (Bounding Box) or E (East).

ANSWER:

Given that:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is B of region z

Let me analyze the possible relations between x and z by considering the constraints.

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom is at or above y's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)

For y B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left is at or right of z's left)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right is at or left of z's right)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y's bottom is at or above z's bottom)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's top is at or below z's top)

Combining these constraints:
1. For the vertical dimension: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   This means x is vertically contained within z's extent.

2. For the horizontal dimension, we have:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is within z horizontally)

Two possible relations emerge:
- B: If z extends far enough east to contain x (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z))
- E: If x is completely east of z (supx(z) < infx(x))

The answer is: B, E
