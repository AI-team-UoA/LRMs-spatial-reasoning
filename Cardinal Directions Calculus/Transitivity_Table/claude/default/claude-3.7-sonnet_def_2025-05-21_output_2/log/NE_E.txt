PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This question asks about the possible relation(s) between region x and region z, given the following:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is E of region z

Let's analyze what each of these relations means, and then determine the possible relations between x and z.

1. x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
   This means x is to the northeast of y. In other words, x is both to the north and to the east of y.

2. y E z means: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
   This means y is to the east of z. In other words, y is directly to the east of z, with potentially some overlap in the north-south direction.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

Given that x is NE of y, and y is E of z, we can deduce that:
- x is to the east of y (because NE implies east)
- y is to the east of z
- Therefore, x is to the east of z (transitivity of the east relation)

Additionally:
- x is to the north of y (because NE implies north)
- y could be at the same latitude as z, north of z, or south of z (since E allows for any north-south relationship)

Let's consider the possible cases:

Case 1: If y is at the same latitude as z (i.e., infy(y) = infy(z) and supy(y) = supy(z))
- Then, since x is to the north of y, x is also to the north of z.
- Combined with the fact that x is to the east of z, this means x is NE of z.

Case 2: If y is to the north of z (i.e., supy(z) <= infy(y))
- Then, since x is to the north of y, x is also to the north of z.
- Combined with the fact that x is to the east of z, this means x is NE of z.

Case 3: If y is to the south of z (i.e., supy(y) <= infy(z))
- Then, the relationship between x and z in the north-south direction is unclear.
- x is to the north of y, and y is to the south of z.
- If x is so far north that it's also north of z, then x is NE of z.
- If x is not as far north and is at the same latitude as z, then x is E of z.
- If x is even less far north and is south of z, then x is SE of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Actually, let me be more careful and use the formal definitions.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's determine the relationship between x and z:

First, for the east-west direction:
- From x NE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
- From y E z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y).
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x).
This means x is to the east of z.

Now, for the north-south direction:
- From x NE y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x).
- From y E z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Using these, we can't immediately determine the north-south relationship between x and z. We need to consider the different possible cases:

Case 1: supy(z) <= infy(x)
In this case, x is to the north of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the east of z, this would make x NE of z.

Case 2: infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(x)
In this case, x and z overlap in the north-south direction, and x might be partially to the north of z, partially to the south of z, or entirely at the same latitude as z. Combined with the fact that x is to the east of z, this would make x E of z.

Case 3: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
This is a subcase of Case 2, where z completely contains x in the north-south direction. The relation would still be x E z.

Case 4: infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(z) <= supy(x)
This is another subcase of Case 2, where z and x overlap in the north-south direction. The relation would still be x E z.

Case 5: infy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
This is another subcase of Case 2, where z and x overlap in the north-south direction. The relation would still be x E z.

Case 6: supy(x) <= infy(z)
In this case, x is to the south of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the east of z, this would make x SE of z.

Actually there's something off in the analysis above. Let me just go back to the original definitions and be careful. Also I need to be very careful about the fact that we're talking about spatial regions, not just points.

Let's use the definitions given:

1. x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
   This means x is to the northeast of y. In other words, x is both strictly to the north and strictly to the east of y.

2. y E z means: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
   This means y is to the east of z. In other words, y is strictly to the east of z, and y can range from being strictly south, overlapping in the north-south direction, or strictly north of z.

Let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

First, for the east-west direction:
- From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
- From y E z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x).
This confirms that x is to the east of z.

Now, for the north-south direction:
- From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
- From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let's see if we can deduce a relationship between x and z in the north-south direction from these constraints.

We have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

But these constraints don't give us a clear relationship between infy(x) and any bounds of z, or between supy(x) and any bounds of z.

For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
For x to be E of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).

Let's check if any of these are consistent with our known constraints:

For NE: Is supy(z) <= infy(x) consistent with our known constraints?
We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
These don't directly tell us about the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). It is possible that supy(z) <= infy(x), which would make x NE of z.

For E: Are infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) consistent with our known constraints?
We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
By transitivity, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) + some positive value.
This is not directly infy(z) <= infy(x), but if the "+some positive value" part is large enough, then infy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
Similarly, we don't have a direct constraint on supy(x) and supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z) is also possible.
Thus, x E z is a possibility.

For SE: Is supy(x) <= infy(z) consistent with our known constraints?
We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
These don't directly tell us about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It is possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), which would make x SE of z.

So, based on our constraints, x could be NE, E, or SE of z. But let me double-check this by considering specific numerical examples to make sure.

Wait, there's one logical leap above that could be incorrect. I said:

"By transitivity, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) + some positive value."

But actually, from supy(y) <= infy(x), we cannot deduce infy(y) <= infy(x) + some positive value. In fact, we don't know the relationship between infy(y) and infy(x).

Let's reconsider:

For x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

For y E z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

And for the relationship between x and z, which we're trying to determine:

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's first check what we know about the east-west relationship:
From the constraints, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x is to the east of z, which is consistent with x being NE, E, or SE of z.

For the north-south relationship, let's check each possible relation:

For x NE z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). 
We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
These don't directly tell us if supy(z) <= infy(x). Both supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(z) > infy(x) are consistent with the constraints.
So, x NE z is a possibility.

For x E z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We know infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't have a direct constraint relating infy(y) to infy(x). Similarly, we don't have a direct constraint relating supy(x) to supy(z).
Both infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(z) > infy(x) are consistent with the constraints. Similarly, both supy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z) are consistent.
So, x E z is a possibility.

For x SE z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
We don't have direct constraints relating supy(x) to infy(z).
Both supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(x) > infy(z) are consistent with the constraints.
So, x SE z is a possibility.

To illustrate, let me give a numerical example for each possibility:

Hmm, but hold on, I think I can say more by combining constraints.

For y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
For x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).

By transitivity, supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NE of z. This is a possibility.
If infy(x) < supy(z), there are two subcases:
   a. infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which makes x E of z. This is a possibility.
   b. infy(z) > infy(x) or supy(x) > supy(z), which makes x not E of z. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z. This is also a possibility.

I realize I'm not reasoning this through in a fully clear way. Let me create a numerical example and check.

Consider the following scenario:
- Region z has coordinates: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10.
- Region y has coordinates: infx(y) = 15, supx(y) = 25, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 8.
- Region x has coordinates: infx(x) = 30, supx(x) = 40, infy(x) = 12, supy(x) = 18.

With these coordinates:
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(y) = 15, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 8 <= supy(z) = 10. So, y E z.
- supx(y) = 25 <= infx(x) = 30, supy(y) = 8 <= infy(x) = 12. So, x NE y.

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(x) = 30, and supy(z) = 10 <= infy(x) = 12. 
This means x is NE of z.

So, x NE z is a possibility.

Now, let's modify the coordinates to see if x E z is a possibility:
- Region z has coordinates: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 20.
- Region y has coordinates: infx(y) = 15, supx(y) = 25, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 8.
- Region x has coordinates: infx(x) = 30, supx(x) = 40, infy(x) = 12, supy(x) = 18.

With these coordinates:
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(y) = 15, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 8 <= supy(z) = 20. So, y E z.
- supx(y) = 25 <= infx(x) = 30, supy(y) = 8 <= infy(x) = 12. So, x NE y.

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(x) = 30, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 12, and supy(x) = 18 <= supy(z) = 20.
This means x is E of z.

So, x E z is a possibility.

And let's modify again to check if x SE z is a possibility:
- Region z has coordinates: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 20, supy(z) = 30.
- Region y has coordinates: infx(y) = 15, supx(y) = 25, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 8.
- Region x has coordinates: infx(x) = 30, supx(x) = 40, infy(x) = 12, supy(x) = 18.

With these coordinates:
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(y) = 15, infy(z) = 20 <= infy(y) + (some positive value), but infy(z) > infy(y), which is not consistent with y E z. So this is not a valid example.

Let me correct this:
- Region z has coordinates: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 30.
- Region y has coordinates: infx(y) = 15, supx(y) = 25, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 8.
- Region x has coordinates: infx(x) = 30, supx(x) = 40, infy(x) = 12, supy(x) = 18.

With these coordinates:
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(y) = 15, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 8 <= supy(z) = 30. So, y E z.
- supx(y) = 25 <= infx(x) = 30, supy(y) = 8 <= infy(x) = 12. So, x NE y.

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(x) = 30, this is consistent with x being E or NE or SE of z.
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 12, and supy(x) = 18 <= supy(z) = 30. 
This means x is E of z, not SE.

Let me try again for SE:
- Region z has coordinates: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 20, supy(z) = 30.
- Region y has coordinates: infx(y) = 15, supx(y) = 25, infy(y) = 15, supy(y) = 18.
- Region x has coordinates: infx(x) = 30, supx(x) = 40, infy(x) = 10, supy(x) = 15.

With these coordinates:
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(y) = 15, infy(z) = 20 > infy(y) = 15, which is inconsistent with y E z. So this is not a valid example.

Actually, with the given constraints, it seems challenging to construct an example where x is SE of z. I need to think more carefully about this.

Let's revisit the constraints:
- For y E z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).
- For x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From the constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so the first condition for x to be SE of z is satisfied.

For the second condition, supy(x) <= infy(z), we need to see if it's consistent with the given constraints.

We know supy(y) <= infy(x) from x NE y.
We know infy(z) <= infy(y) from y E z.

Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).

This means infy(z) <= infy(x). But for x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that infy(x) <= supy(x) (by definition of a region), if infy(z) <= infy(x), then it cannot be the case that supy(x) <= infy(z). This is a contradiction.

So, it seems x cannot be SE of z given the constraints. The possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

Actually, I think I'm making an error in the reasoning. Let me be very careful.

For y E z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

For x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x is to the east of z.
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)

For the north-south relationship:

For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
For x to be E of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).

We know supy(y) <= infy(x).
We also know supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z).

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NE of z.
If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.
If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z.

But, remember we deduced infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). By transitivity, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
This not only means that the second condition for E is satisfied, but it also means that the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) cannot be satisfied (since infy(x) <= supy(x) by definition, and if infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(z) cannot hold).

Therefore, x cannot be SE of z. The possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

Let's try to construct specific examples to confirm:

For x NE z:
- Region z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 5
- Region y: infx(y) = 10, supx(y) = 15, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4
- Region x: infx(x) = 20, supx(x) = 25, infy(x) = 10, supy(x) = 15

With these:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 10, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4 <= supy(z) = 5. So, y E z.
- supx(y) = 15 <= infx(x) = 20, supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 10. So, x NE y.
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 20, supy(z) = 5 <= infy(x) = 10. So, x NE z.

For x E z:
- Region z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 15
- Region y: infx(y) = 10, supx(y) = 15, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4
- Region x: infx(x) = 20, supx(x) = 25, infy(x) = 10, supy(x) = 12

With these:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 10, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4 <= supy(z) = 15. So, y E z.
- supx(y) = 15 <= infx(x) = 20, supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 10. So, x NE y.
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 20, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 10, supy(x) = 12 <= supy(z) = 15. So, x E z.

I'm now convinced that the possible relations between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is E of z, are NE and E.

But let me see if I can construct an example where x is SE of z to be absolutely certain.

For x SE z:
- Region z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 10, supy(z) = 15
- Region y: infx(y) = 10, supx(y) = 15, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4
- Region x: infx(x) = 20, supx(x) = 25, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 8

With these:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 10, infy(z) = 10 > infy(y) = 2, which violates the constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) for y E z.

So this example doesn't work. Let's try another:

- Region z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 10, supy(z) = 15
- Region y: infx(y) = 10, supx(y) = 15, infy(y) = 10, supy(y) = 12
- Region x: infx(x) = 20, supx(x) = 25, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 8

With these:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 10, infy(z) = 10 <= infy(y) = 10, supy(y) = 12 <= supy(z) = 15. So, y E z.
- supx(y) = 15 <= infx(x) = 20, supy(y) = 12 > infy(x) = 5, which violates the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x) for x NE y.

So this example doesn't work either.

Let's try another approach. If x is to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). For z, y, and x to satisfy the given constraints:

For y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

For x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

Let's see if we can satisfy all of these. For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y).

So, by transitivity:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x)

This means infy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be SE of z. So, x cannot be SE of z given the constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

Wait, I may have been making an error in the reasoning above. Let me double check.

For y E z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

For x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so the first condition for x to be SE of z is satisfied.

For the second condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). We also know from the constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)

There's a logical issue here. I said infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), so infy(z) <= supy(x). This contadicts supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x cannot be SE of z. I think this is correct, but I wonder if I'm missing something...

Actually, I'm skipping a step. Just because infy(y) <= supy(y) doesn't mean infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). The actual constraint from x NE y is supy(y) <= infy(x), not infy(y) <= infy(x).

So, the constraint chain should be:
infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

From these, we can't directly deduce a relationship between infy(z) and infy(x) or supy(x).

However, let's think about the intuition. If x is NE of y, then x is "above and to the right" of y. If y is E of z, then y is "directly to the right" of z, possibly with some overlap in the north-south direction. If we combine these, it means x is "above and to the right" of something that is "directly to the right" of z. By transitivity, x is to the right of z. But the north-south relationship between x and z depends on how far north x is compared to y and how far north y is compared to z. If y is far north of z and x is just a little north of y, then x could be E of z. If y is far north of z and x is far north of y, then x could be NE of z.

Let's try to construct a specific example where x is SE of z:

- Region z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 15, supy(z) = 20
- Region y: infx(y) = 10, supx(y) = 15, infy(y) = 0, supy(y) = 5
- Region x: infx(x) = 20, supx(x) = 25, infy(x) = 8, supy(x) = 12

With these:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 10, but infy(z) = 15 > infy(y) = 0, which violates the constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) for y E z.

This doesn't work. Let's try again:

- Region z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 15, supy(z) = 20
- Region y: infx(y) = 10, supx(y) = 15, infy(y) = 15, supy(y) = 18
- Region x: infx(x) = 20, supx(x) = 25, infy(x) = 8, supy(x) = 12

With these:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 10, infy(z) = 15 <= infy(y) = 15, supy(y) = 18 <= supy(z) = 20. So, y E z.
- supx(y) = 15 <= infx(x) = 20, but supy(y) = 18 > infy(x) = 8, which violates the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x) for x NE y.

This doesn't work either.

Actually, I think I need to be careful about the interpretation of the constraints. Let me reconsider:

For y E z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means y is to the east of z, and there's a north-south alignment such that y is not completely north or south of z.

For x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

This means x is to the northeast of y.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our constraints, we can deduce supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x is to the east of z.

Now, for supy(x) <= infy(z), we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y). By the definition of a region, we have infy(x) <= supy(x). So, supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), meaning supy(y) <= supy(x).

Also, from y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y). We don't have a direct constraint relating infy(y) and supy(y), but by definition of a region, infy(y) <= supy(y). So, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(x).

This gives us infy(z) <= supy(x), which is the opposite of what we need for x SE z (which is supy(x) <= infy(z)). So, x cannot be SE of z given the constraints.

Double check: if we have infy(z) <= supy(x), the opposite of which would be supy(x) <= infy(z). Since both conditions cannot be true simultaneously (unless supy(x) = infy(z), but let's consider the strict case), and infy(z) <= supy(x) is a conclusion from our constraints, x cannot be SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NE and E. Let me revisit the examples to confirm:

For x NE z:
- Region z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 5
- Region y: infx(y) = 10, supx(y) = 15, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4
- Region x: infx(x) = 20, supx(x) = 25, infy(x) = 10, supy(x) = 15

With these:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 10, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4 <= supy(z) = 5. So, y E z.
- supx(y) = 15 <= infx(x) = 20, supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 10. So, x NE y.
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 20, supy(z) = 5 <= infy(x) = 10. So, x NE z.

For x E z:
- Region z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 15
- Region y: infx(y) = 10, supx(y) = 15, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4
- Region x: infx(x) = 20, supx(x) = 25, infy(x) = 10, supy(x) = 12

With these:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 10, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4 <= supy(z) = 15. So, y E z.
- supx(y) = 15 <= infx(x) = 20, supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 10. So, x NE y.
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 20, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 10, supy(x) = 12 <= supy(z) = 15. So, x E z.

So far, we've confirmed that x can be NE or E of z.

Let me check for other possible relationships, such as N (North).

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x). This is incompatible with infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (which would mean x is neither to the east nor to the west of z). So, x N z is not possible.

How about x NW z, x W z, or x SW z? For any of these, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But from our constraints, we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), so infx(z) <= supx(z) <= supx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be NW, W, or SW of z.

Let's also consider x B z.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

But, as we've seen, the constraint supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

Let's also check for S (South).

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

Again, the constraint supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

Wait, let me check one more time for the SE relation. I want to be sure whether x can be SE of z or not.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied. For the second condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).

From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y).

By combining these, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x)

This means infy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SE of z.

Given our analysis, the only possible relations between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is E of z, are NE and E.

Actually, wait, let's double check that I understand the definition of "E" correctly. Above I said:

"For y E z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means y is to the east of z, and there's a north-south alignment such that y is not completely north or south of z."

I'll double check the definition of the "E" relation:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Actually I got the last constraint wrong. Let me correct. For y E z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means y is to the east of z, and y's north-south extent is within z's north-south extent (i.e., y is not completely north or south of z).

I think this interpretation is correct. Moving on, let's double check my logic for determining whether x can be SE of z or not.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied. For the second condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).

From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y).

But I don't see a direct way to conclude supy(x) <= infy(z) or infy(z) <= supy(x) from these.

Let's approach this differently. If x is SE of z, then:
- x is to the east of z, which is consistent with the constraints.
- x is to the south of z, i.e., x is below z, which means supy(x) <= infy(z).

From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y). If infy(z) < infy(y), then we could potentially have supy(x) <= infy(z). But from x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).

Given the structure of the regions, infy(x) <= supy(x). Combining with supy(y) <= infy(x), we get supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).

From y E z, we also have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) (by definition of a region). Consequently, infy(z) <= supy(y) <= supy(x).

This means infy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be SE of z. Hence, x cannot be SE of z.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is E of z, are NE and E.

Actually, hold on one more time. I'm revisiting the definition of "E" and I'm not sure if I'm understanding it correctly. Let's look at the definition closely:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Wait, a E b is when a is to the east of b. I've been saying y E z means y is to the east of z, which is correct. However, the formal definition states: "a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)."

Let's check if I've been using the constraints correctly:
For y E z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Yes, this is correct. y is to the east of z, and y's north-south extent is within z's north-south extent.

For x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

This is correct too. x is to the northeast of y.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Checking if this can be derived from the constraints:
From supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), we get supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z. This part is consistent with x being SE of z.

For the north-south relationship, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
From x NE y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y E z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y).

By transitivity, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) (by definition of a region), and supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) (by definition of a region). This means infy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). Hence, x cannot be SE of z, but it can be NE or E of z.

OK so I revisited the problem from scratch and came to the same conclusion: the possible relations between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is E of z, are NE and E.

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y: 
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is E of region z:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

First, let's determine the east-west relationship:
From the given relations, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z)
- infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x NE y)

By transitivity: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
This means x must be to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship:
- From x NE y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y E z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
1. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x): then x is NE of z
2. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z): then x is E of z

The SE relation isn't possible because the constraints imply infy(z) ≤ supy(x), which contradicts the SE requirement of supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E
