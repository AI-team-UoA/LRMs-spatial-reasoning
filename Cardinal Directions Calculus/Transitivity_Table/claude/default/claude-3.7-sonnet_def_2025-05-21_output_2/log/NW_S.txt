PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's solve this logically by using the definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

We have:
- Region x is NW of region y (x NW y)
- Region y is S of region z (y S z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

According to the definitions:

1. x NW y means: 
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y S z means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally within the bounds of z)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

For the horizontal relationship:
- From x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y S z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- Therefore: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- This means: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible (x can be west of z)

For the vertical relationship:
- From x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Therefore: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- This doesn't conclusively tell us the relation between infy(x) and infy(z)

Actually, let me rethink how to approach this. I need to be careful about the constraints and make sure I'm interpreting them correctly.

Let me draw this out conceptually:

If x is NW of y:
- x is to the north and west of y
- This means x is in the northwest quadrant relative to y

If y is S of z:
- y is to the south of z
- y is horizontally within the bounds of z

Now, let's put these together to determine where x could be relative to z.

Given that x is to the northwest of y, and y is to the south of z, x could be:
- W of z (if x is sufficiently west and within the vertical bounds of z)
- NW of z (if x is northwest of z)
- N of z (if x is sufficiently north and within the horizontal bounds of z)
- SW of z (if x is southwest of z but still northwest of y)
- S of z (if x is south of z but still northwest of y)

Let me check each of these possibilities:

1. x W z:
   - This means: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - Given x NW y and y S z, is this possible?
   - We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This is consistent with x W z.
   - For the vertical constraint, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). This doesn't tell us directly about the relation between infy(x) and infy(z), or between supy(x) and supy(z).
   - So, x W z is a possibility if x is vertically within the bounds of z.

2. x NW z:
   - This means: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is consistent with our constraints.
   - For supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). This doesn't directly tell us about supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - However, if infy(x) is sufficiently large, then x NW z is possible.

Hmm, I realize I'm finding it hard to extract clear conclusions from these constraints. Let me try a more direct approach using diagrams.

If x is NW of y, then x is to the north and west of y.
If y is S of z, then y is to the south of z, and horizontally within z's bounds.

Visualizing this, and considering the possible positions of x relative to z, x could be:
- W of z (if x is west of z and vertically within z's bounds)
- NW of z (if x is northwest of z)
- N of z (if x is north of z and horizontally within z's bounds)
- SW of z (if x is southwest of z)

Wait, I don't think x can be SW of z or S of z given our constraints. Let me check:

For x to be SW of z, x should be to the southwest of z, which means x is south and west of z.
But if y is south of z, and x is north of y, then x can't be south of z. So, x can't be SW of z or S of z.

Actually, let me reconsider. I think the key is to realize that the relation "x NW y" doesn't mean x is strictly northwest of y; it means x is in the northwest tile relative to y's bounding box. Similarly, "y S z" means y is in the south tile relative to z's bounding box.

Given these interpretations:
- If x is in the NW tile of y, and y is in the S tile of z, then x could be in the W, NW, or N tile of z, depending on the exact positions.

But there's another possibility I didn't consider: what if z's bounding box completely contains x? In that case, x would be in the B tile of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, N, and B.

Actually, let me verify that:

1. x W z is possible.
2. x NW z is possible.
3. x N z is possible.
4. x B z (the trivial case) is possible. No, this isn't the trivial case. This is the case where x is completely within z's bounding box.

Wait, I'm making a mistake. I need to consider the definitions of the relations more carefully.

For x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

For y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

Now, let's see:

For x W z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically within z)

Given our constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).

This doesn't directly tell us if supx(x) <= infx(z). So, we can't be sure if x is West of z.

wait. Actually, I think I need to be more careful. If x is NW of y and y is S of z, that doesn't automatically tell us if x is W of z. It depends on the relative positions of x, y, and z.

Let's be more systematic. For the cardinal directions, we're dividing the plane into 9 tiles based on the bounding box of a reference region. For any region a and reference region b, the relation a R b (where R is one of the 9 cardinal directions) means that a is in the R tile of b.

If x NW y and y S z, where can x be in relation to z?

Let's denote the minimum bounding box of y as MBB(y).
- If x NW y, then x is in the NW tile of MBB(y).
- If y S z, then y is in the S tile of MBB(z).

Now, let's visualize how the MBB(y) is positioned relative to MBB(z) if y S z:
- MBB(y) is below MBB(z).
- MBB(y) is horizontally within the bounds of MBB(z).

Given this, the NW tile of MBB(y) can overlap with the W, NW, N, or SW tile of MBB(z), depending on the exact positions.

But there's a constraint here. If y is in the S tile of MBB(z), then MBB(y) is below MBB(z). If x is in the NW tile of MBB(y), then x is above MBB(y). Given that MBB(y) is below MBB(z), x being above MBB(y) doesn't necessarily mean x is above MBB(z); it could still be below or within the bounds of MBB(z).

Let me try to visualize this:
- y is below z
- x is above y, but not necessarily above z. Actually, let me think about it: if y is below z, and x is above y, then x could be above z, below z, or within the vertical bounds of z.
- x is to the west of y.
- y is horizontally within the bounds of z. x is to the west of y, and y is horizontally within the bounds of z. If x is to the west of y, it's definitely to the west of z, because y is horizontally within z.

With those constraints, x could be:
- W of z (if x is west of z and vertically within the bounds of z)
- NW of z (if x is west of z and north of z)
- SW of z (if x is west of z and south of z)

So, the possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, SW.

Wait. Let me visualize this differently

Scenario 1: x is in the NW quadrant of y, and y is directly below z.
In this scenario, x is to the west of z and can be either north, south, or directly west of z. This translates to the relations: NW, W, or SW.

Scenario 2: y is directly below z, but x is on the left edge of the NW quadrant of y.
In this case, x is directly west of z, making the relation: W.

Scenario 3: y is directly below z, but x is on the upper edge of the NW quadrant of y.
Here, x is north and west of z, translating to the relation: NW.

Scenario 4: y is directly below z, but x is on the left and slightly below the upper edge of the NW quadrant of y.
In this scenario, x is west of z and can be within the vertical bounds of z, making the relation: W.

It seems from all my considerations, the possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

However, I realize I've been a bit inconsistent. Let me make sure I'm being precise.

We're asking for the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x NW y and y S z.

For region x to be in the NW tile of region y, it means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

For region y to be in the S tile of region z, it means:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to see which of the 9 cardinal directions can hold.

1. x B z:
   - For this to hold, infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From x NW y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
   - From y S z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).
   - Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This can lead to either supx(x) <= infx(z) or infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y).
   - In the first case, x is entirely to the west of z, meaning x cannot be in the B tile of z.
   - In the second case, x and z overlap horizontally. For x to be in the B tile of z, they should also overlap vertically, but that depends on other constraints.
   - Let's check the vertical constraints.
   - From x NW y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - From y S z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).
   - Therefore, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z). This doesn't tell us the relation between infy(x) and infy(z).
   - Given these constraints, it's possible for x to be in the B tile of z, but it's not guaranteed.

2. x S z:
   - For this to hold, supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - From x NW y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(x) >= supy(y).
   - From y S z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(y) <= infy(z).
   - Therefore, we have infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z). This can result in infy(x) >= infy(z) in some cases, and infy(x) < infy(z) in others. In the first case, x would not be in the S tile of z. In the second case, we need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From the constraints, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   - So, it's possible for x to be in the S tile of z, but it's not guaranteed.

I realize the analysis for each of the 9 cardinal directions becomes intricate and might lead to scenarios where certain relations are possible under specific conditions.

But I think we need to be more rigorous. Let me visualize the constraints:

If x NW y, then x is in the NW tile of the bounding box of y.
If y S z, then y is in the S tile of the bounding box of z.

Given the positions of x, y, and z, we want to determine the relation between x and z. The region x could be in one or more of the 9 tiles with respect to z, depending on its exact position.

Alright, let me try a different approach by constructing a specific scenario:

Assume z is a square region with its MBB ranging from (0,0) to (10,10).
If y S z, then y is in the S tile of z, which means y is below z. Let's say y's MBB ranges from (2,-5) to (8,-1).
If x NW y, then x is in the NW tile of y, which means x is to the northwest of y. Let's say x's MBB ranges from (0,-0.5) to (1,0.5).

In this specific scenario, x is west of z and partially overlaps with z vertically. This means the relation between x and z is W.

But if I adjust the position of x, I can get different relations:
- If x's MBB is, say, (0,11) to (1,12), then x is NW of z.
- If x's MBB is, say, (0,-8) to (1,-7), then x is SW of z.

So, based on this exploration, it seems the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

But actually, let me check if any other relations are possible.

Assume z is as before, a square region with its MBB ranging from (0,0) to (10,10).
If y S z, then y's MBB could range from, say, (2,-5) to (8,-1).

Now, if x NW y, then x's MBB could be:
- (-2,0) to (-1,1) -- In this case, x is W of z.
- (-2,11) to (-1,12) -- In this case, x is NW of z.
- (-2,-8) to (-1,-7) -- In this case, x is SW of z.

Are there any other positions for x where it would have a different relation with z?

Let's say z's MBB is (0,0) to (10,10).
And y's MBB is (2,-5) to (8,-1).

For x to be N of z, it should be above z and horizontally within the bounds of z. That is, x's MBB should be something like (2,11) to (8,12).
But for x to be NW of y, it should be to the northwest of y, which means west and north of y. Given y's MBB of (2,-5) to (8,-1), x being NW of y means x should be west of x < 2 (the western boundary of y) and north of y > -1 (the northern boundary of y).
So, x's MBB could be, say, (0,0) to (1,1). But with this, x is W of z, not N of z.

In fact, for x to be N of z given that y S z and x NW y, x should be north of z (so above 10) and horizontally within z (so between 0 and 10 horizontally). But for x to be NW of y, it should be west of y (so to the left of 2) and north of y (so above -1). These constraints seem contradictory for x to be N of z.

Similarly, for x to be NE of z, it should be above and to the right of z.

Let's be more systematic.

For x to be B of z, it should be inside the MBB of z. But for x to be NW of y, it should be to the northwest of y. If y is below z, then for x to be inside z, it should be above y and still inside z. This is possible if x is in the lower part of z and the NW part of y.

Let's take z's MBB as (0,0) to (10,10) and y's MBB as (2,-5) to (8,-1).
For x to be NW of y, it should be to the left of 2 and above -1.
For x to be B of z, it should be inside the MBB of z, which is (0,0) to (10,10).
So, x's MBB could be, say, (0,0) to (1,1). In this case, x is inside z and to the northwest of y. So, the relation between x and z is B.

For x to be S of z, it should be below z. But for x to be NW of y, it should be to the northwest of y. If y is below z, then for x to be below z, it should also be below y (because y is already below z). But for x to be NW of y, it should be north of y. These constraints seem contradictory for x to be S of z.

For x to be SE of z, it should be to the southeast of z. But for x to be NW of y, it should be to the northwest of y. These directions seem contradictory.

Similarly, for x to be E of z, it should be to the east of z. And for x to be NW of y, it should be to the northwest of y. These directions also seem contradictory.

For x to be N of z, it should be above z and horizontally within the bounds of z. For x to be NW of y, it should be to the northwest of y. If y is directly below z, then for x to be above z and NW of y, it should be to the west of the western boundary of y (which is 2) and above z (which is above 10). So, x's MBB could be, say, (0,11) to (1,12). In this case, x is actually NW of z, not N of z.

It seems the more I explore, the more I lean towards the conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, SW, and B.

Hmm, actually, let me try to be more methodical, because perhaps I'm messing up with specific cases.

First, let's think of the cardinal direction grid. When we say a region y is to the south of a region z, we're saying that y is in the S tile of the 9-tile Cardinal Directions grid centered on z. Similarly, when we say x is to the northwest of region y, we mean that x is in the NW tile of the Cardinal Directions grid centered on y.

Given these two constraints, we want to determine the possible position of region x with respect to region z.

W relation:
- For x to be W of z, x should be to the west of z and vertically within z's bounds.
- Is this possible given our constraints?
- Yes. 
  * Consider z's bounding box is from (0,0) to (10,10).
  * If y's bounding box is from (2,-5) to (8,-1), then y is in the S tile of z.
  * Now, x's bounding box from (-2,0) to (-1,1) would make x in the W tile of z. And also in the NW tile of y. This is valid.

NW relation:
- For x to be NW of z, x should be to the northwest of z.
- Is this possible given our constraints?
- Yes. 
  * Consider z's bounding box is from (0,0) to (10,10).
  * If y's bounding box is from (2,-5) to (8,-1), then y is in the S tile of z.
  * Now, x's bounding box from (-2,11) to (-1,12) would make x in the NW tile of z. And also in the NW tile of y. This is valid.

N relation:
- For x to be N of z, x should be to the north of z and horizontally within z's bounds.
- Is this possible given our constraints?
- No.
  * Consider z's bounding box is from (0,0) to (10,10).
  * If y's bounding box is from (2,-5) to (8,-1), then y is in the S tile of z.
  * For x to be in the N tile of z, x's bounding box should be from, say, (2,11) to (8,12).
  * But for x to be in the NW tile of y, x should be to the west of the western boundary of y (which is 2) and to the north of the northern boundary of y (which is -1).
  * x's bounding box from (2,11) to (8,12) is not to the west of y, so x is not in the NW tile of y. Therefore, it's not possible for x to be in the N tile of z.

Let me double-check the N relation.

If y S z, then infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). That is, the horizontal projection of y is within the horizontal projection of z.

For x to be N of z, it should be horizontally within z. That is, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

But for x to be NW of y, we need supx(x) <= infx(y), which means x is entirely to the west of y.

Given these constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (for x to be N of z)

We can't habe both supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(x) if infx(z) <= infx(y), because that would imply supx(x) < infx(x), which is a contradiction. So, x can't be N of z.

NE relation:
- For x to be NE of z, x should be to the northeast of z.
- Is this possible given our constraints? No, because for x to be NW of y, it needs to be west of y. And given that y is horizontally within z, if x is west of y, it can't be east of z.

E relation:
- For x to be E of z, x should be to the east of z and vertically within z's bounds.
- Is this possible given our constraints? No, for the same reason as above.

SE relation:
- For x to be SE of z, x should be to the southeast of z.
- Is this possible given our constraints? No, for the same reason. Also, if y is south of z and x is north of y, it seems unlikely for x to be south of z.

S relation:
- For x to be S of z, x should be to the south of z and horizontally within z's bounds.
- Is this possible given our constraints?

Let me give a more rigorous check for the S relation.

If y S z, then supy(y) <= infy(z). That is, y is entirely to the south of z. Also, infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). That is, the horizontal projection of y is within the horizontal projection of z.

For x to be S of z, it should satisfy:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)

But for x to be NW of y, 
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)

Given these constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (for x to be S of z)

We can't have both supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(x) if infx(z) <= infx(y), as discussed previously.

Also, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (for x to be S of z)

If supy(y) <= infy(x), and we assume infy(x) < supy(x) (which is inherent in the nature of bounding boxes), then:
supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x)

And for x to be S of z, supy(x) <= infy(z).

If supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z), then:
supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(y)

This is a contradiction because a number can't be less than itself. So, x can't be S of z.

To be precise here: supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(y) would give us supy(y) < supy(y), which is absurd.

SW relation:
- For x to be SW of z, x should be to the southwest of z.
- Is this possible given our constraints?

Let me give a more rigorous check for the SW relation.

For x to be SW of z, it should satisfy:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is south of z)

But for x to be NW of y, 
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)

Given these constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (for x to be SW of z)

If infx(z) <= infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(y) doesn't necessarily imply supx(x) <= infx(z). But it's possible if infx(z) << infx(y), allowing this.

Also, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (for x to be SW of z)

If supy(y) <= infy(x), and we assume infy(x) < supy(x) (which is inherent in the nature of bounding boxes), then:
supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x)

For x to be SW of z, supy(x) <= infy(z).

If supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z), then it's possible for:
supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z)

This is consistent. So, x can be SW of z.

Actually, we also need to consider the B relation.

B relation:
- For x to be B of z, x should be entirely inside the bounding box of z.
- Is this possible given our constraints?

To summarize the deductions above:
- W is a possible relation between x and z.
- NW is a possible relation between x and z.
- SW is a possible relation between x and z.

Let's check for the B relation.

For x to be B of z, it should satisfy:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically within z)

But for x to be NW of y, 
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)

And y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

Given these constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (for x to be B of z)

These constraints don't seem to be compatible. If supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). For x to be B of z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x), which, combined with supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), gives us infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y).

This is indeed consistent, allowing for the scenario where x is horizontally within z but to the west of y.

For vertical constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (for x to be B of z)

But how can we have both supy(y) <= infy(z) from our premise and infy(z) <= infy(x) from the requirement for the B relation? If we assume supy(y) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), then it's consistent with x being north of y, as required by the "x NW y" constraint. So this is also consistent.

It seems the B relation is indeed possible between x and z.

In summary, the possible relations between region x and region z are: W, NW, SW, and B.

For completeness, let me double-check my reasoning for the B relation once more.

For x to be B of z, we need both:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically within z)

Now, with x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)

And with y S z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

For the horizontal constraint in (1), we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
We already have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y). If infx(y) <= supx(z), which is possible given that supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z), then supx(x) <= supx(z), fulfilling half of the horizontal constraint.

But for the other half, we need infx(z) <= infx(x). However, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z). These two constraints don't directly inform us about the relation between infx(z) and infx(x).

It's possible that infx(z) <= infx(x), but it's also possible that infx(x) < infx(z). If the latter, then x can't be B of z.

Let's think about the vertical constraint in (2) next.
We need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We already have supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z). These two constraints don't directly inform us about the relation between infy(z) and infy(x). It's possible for infy(z) <= infy(x), but it's also possible for infy(x) < infy(z). And, similarly, we don't have direct information about the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).

Actually, wait. That z is a region in REG, which means that z is a closed region homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. Any cardinal direction relation with respect to z is determined by the 9 tiles constructed based on the minimum bounding box of z. Let's clarify the cardinal directions grid again as:

Suppose a is a reference region with a minimum bounding box. The cardinal directions grid divides the plane into 9 tiles:
B: inside the bounding box of a.
N, S, E, W: north, south, east, west of the bounding box of a.
NE, NW, SE, SW: northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest of the bounding box of a.

Given this setup, if a region b is located in one or more of these 9 tiles, we describe the relation between b and a using the corresponding cardinal direction(s).

Let's redraw this:
- z's minimum bounding box defines our reference grid.
- If y S z, then y is in the S tile, which means y is to the south of z's bounding box.
- If x NW y, then x is in the NW tile of y's bounding box.

Given these constraints, where can x be in relation to z's bounding box?

If y is entirely to the south of z's bounding box, and x is to the northwest of y's bounding box, then x could be to the west of z, to the northwest of z, to the southwest of z, or within z, depending on the exact positions. This confirms that the relations W, NW, SW, and B are all possible.

Actually, the more I think about it, I think there's another case that I haven't discussed: the "Overlapping relations". For instance, a region could simultaneously be in the W and NW tiles of a reference region.

But that's already covered by the Cardinal Direction Relations model, where if a region overlaps with multiple tiles, its relation is described as a conjunction of those tile names. For example, if a region overlaps with both the W and NW tiles of a reference region, its relation is described as "W : NW".

So, to be absolutely clear, the task is to identify the single-tile cardinal direction relations that could hold between x and z, given the constraints. And those relations are:
- W (x is west of z and vertically within z's bounds)
- NW (x is to the northwest of z)
- SW (x is to the southwest of z)
- B (x is inside z's bounding box)

Let me double-check my answer in a different way. Let me assume 9 sample points like this, where point (5, 5) is the middle of z's bounding box:

NW: (0, 10) | N: (5, 10) | NE: (10, 10)
---------------------------------
W:  (0, 5)  | B: (5, 5)  | E: (10, 5)
---------------------------------
SW: (0, 0)  | S: (5, 0)  | SE: (10, 0)

If y is to the south of z, then y could be at the point (5, -5). If x is to the northwest of y, then x might be at the point (0, 0), which would make x to the southwest of z.
Actually, I cannot reason accurately this way, because the information given is only about the Minimum Bounding Boxes; I should avoid concrete points.

Let me try once more to make sure of my result.

If y S z:
- The northern boundary of y is below the southern boundary of z.
- The western boundary of y is to the east of the western boundary of z.
- The eastern boundary of y is to the west of the eastern boundary of z.

If x NW y:
- The eastern boundary of x is to the west of the western boundary of y.
- The southern boundary of x is to the north of the northern boundary of y.

Now, let's see where x can be in relation to z:

For x to be W of z:
- The eastern boundary of x should be to the west of the western boundary of z.
- The southern boundary of x should be below or at the northern boundary of z.
- The northern boundary of x should be above or at the southern boundary of z.

Given our constraints on x and y, this is certainly possible.

For x to be NW of z:
- The eastern boundary of x should be to the west of the western boundary of z.
- The southern boundary of x should be to the north of the northern boundary of z.

Given our constraints on x and y, this is also possible.

For x to be SW of z:
- The eastern boundary of x should be to the west of the western boundary of z.
- The northern boundary of x should be to the south of the southern boundary of z.

Given our constraints on x and y, this is possible.

For x to be N of z:
- The western boundary of x should be to the east of the western boundary of z.
- The eastern boundary of x should be to the west of the eastern boundary of z.
- The southern boundary of x should be to the north of the northern boundary of z.

But if x is to the northwest of y, then the eastern boundary of x is to the west of the western boundary of y, and the western boundary of y is to the east of the western boundary of z. This would mean that the eastern boundary of x is to the west of the western boundary of z, which contradicts the requirement for x to be N of z. So, x can't be N of z.

For x to be NE of z:
- The western boundary of x should be to the east of the eastern boundary of z.
- The southern boundary of x should be to the north of the northern boundary of z.

But if x is to the northwest of y, the eastern boundary of x is to the west of the western boundary of y, and the western boundary of y is to the east of the western boundary of z. This would mean that the eastern boundary of x is likely to the west of the eastern boundary of z, which contradicts the requirement for x to be NE of z. So, x can't be NE of z.

The reasoning for E, SE, and S is similar, and each of those relations is also not possible for x in relation to z.

For x to be B of z:
- The western boundary of x should be to the east of the western boundary of z.
- The eastern boundary of x should be to the west of the eastern boundary of z.
- The southern boundary of x should be to the north of the southern boundary of z.
- The northern boundary of x should be to the south of the northern boundary of z.

If the western boundary of y is exactly the same as the western boundary of z, and if the eastern boundary of x is exactly at the western boundary of y, then the eastern boundary of x is at the western boundary of z. But for x to be within z, the eastern boundary of x should be to the west of the eastern boundary of z, which is possible. Additionally, if the southern boundary of z is exactly the same as the northern boundary of y, and if the southern boundary of x is exactly the same as the northern boundary of y, then the southern boundary of x is exactly the same as the southern boundary of z. But for x to be within z, the southern boundary of x should be to the north of the southern boundary of z, which is possible.

So, B might also be a valid relation.

Actually, wait. If the western boundary of y is the same as the western boundary of z, and the eastern boundary of x is at the western boundary of y, then the eastern boundary of x is at the western boundary of z, and that means the eastern boundary of x is not strictly inside the western boundary of z, which means it's not possible for x to be B of z—it would be W of z. Since "x NW y" means the eastern boundary of x is strictly to the west of the western boundary of y, x cannot be inside z.

So now my answer is only W, NW, and SW.

Actually, I forgot something: "x NW y" means x is entirely to the northwest of y. So for any coordinates (x_coord, y_coord) in region x, we have x_coord <= infx(y) and y_coord >= supy(y). And "y S z" means y is entirely to the south of z.

Let me try once more.

Given "x NW y", for any point in x, it is to the west of the western boundary of y and to the north of the northern boundary of y.
Given "y S z", the northern boundary of y is to the south of the southern boundary of z, and y is horizontally within the bounds of z.

For x to be B of z, it should be entirely within the bounding box of z. But given that x is to the west of the western boundary of y, and y is horizontally within the bounds of z, x is to the west of a point that's within z. If x is to the west of a point within z, then x is not entirely within z; at least a part of x is to the west of z. So, x can't be entirely within the bounding box of z, and it can't be B of z.

Actually, let me clarify. "x NW y" means the region x is in the NW tile of the cardinal direction grid with the reference region being y. Similarly, "y S z" means the region y is in the S tile of the cardinal direction grid with the reference region being z. The division of the cardinal grid would not allow for partial overlap, because it requires the bounding boxes.

Even the definition says: For a single-tile cardinal direction relation B (bounding box), S (South), etc., the condition for "a B b" means "a" is inside the bounding box of "b". Similarly, for "a S b", it means "a" is entirely south of "b" and so on.

Given that x is in the NW tile of y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of y)

And given that y is in the S tile of z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is entirely to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

For x to be B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically within z)

For horizontal constraints, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
These give us supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). The condition for x to be horizontally within z is infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). If supx(x) <= infx(y), it's unlikely that infx(z) <= infx(x), because infx(z) <= infx(y). The only way this could be consistent is if infx(z) = infx(y) and supx(x) = infx(y), but that's an edge case. In general, if x is to the west of y and y is horizontally within z, then x is not horizontally within z.

So, it's unlikely that the B relation is possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

ok let me go even more carefully this time. 

We have regions x, y, and z. We are told:
- x NW y
- y S z

We want to find the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z. Let's analyze the constraints:

1. x NW y means:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)

2. y S z means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is south of z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

Now, let's systematically check each of the 9 potential relations between x and z.

1. x B z: This means x is inside the bounding box of z.
   - Required: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know: supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - This gives: supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y)
   - But it's unlikely for both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(y) to be true simultaneously, since they imply infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y), which is a tight constraint. While it's not universally impossible, it's a specific edge case.
   - So, x B z is generally not a valid possible relation.

2. x N z: This means x is north of z.
   - Required: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We know: supy(y) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(y), and infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - For x to be horizontally within z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - But we have supx(x) <= infx(y), so for infx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y)
   - Again, it's a tight constraint, making it unlikely. So, x N z is generally not valid.

3. x NE z: This means x is northeast of z.
   - Required: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We know: supx(x) <= infx(y), so x can't be to the east of y. And given that y is horizontally within z, x would also not be to the east of z.
   - So, x NE z is not a valid relation.

4. x E z: This means x is east of z.
   - Similar reasoning as NE, x can't be to the east of z.
   - So, x E z is not a valid relation.

5. x SE z: This means x is southeast of z.
   - Similar reasoning as E, combined with the fact that x is north of y, and y is south of z. It's contradicting.
   - So, x SE z is not a valid relation.

6. x S z: This means x is south of z.
   - Required: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We know: supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is south of z).
   - These give: supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
   - For x to be south of z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z). But since x is north of y, and y is south of z, x would not be south of z.
   - So, x S z is not a valid relation.

7. x SW z: This means x is southwest of z.
   - Required: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We know: supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supy(y) <= infy(z)
   - For x to be west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), so it's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - For x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is north of y. And we also know supy(y) <= infy(z), which means y is south of z.
   - Given that x is north of y and y is south of z, it's possible for x to be positioned in such a way that it's south of z. It depends on the exact positions.
   - So, x SW z is a valid possible relation.

8. x W z: This means x is west of z.
   - Required: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know: supx(x) <= infx(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(y) <= infy(z)
   - For x to be west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), so it's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - For x to be vertically within z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z). Given that y is south of z and x is north of y, it's possible for x to be vertically aligned with z.
   - So, x W z is a valid possible relation.

9. x NW z: This means x is northwest of z.
   - Required: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We know: supx(x) <= infx(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(y) <= infy(z)
   - For x to be west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), so it's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - For x to be north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z). Given that y is south of z and x is north of y, it's possible for x to be to the north of z.
   - So, x NW z is a valid possible relation.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

I'm confident my approach to this problem has been thorough. We need to check all 9 relations, not to pick cases or specific examples. I want to make sure I can choose arbitrary regions where those 3 relations (W, NW, and SW) are the only ones possible. These 3 relations all have the property that x is west of z, so regions x are strictly to the west of region z. Now, since y is south of z and x is northwest of y, this means x is north of y, which is south of z. So x could be north of z (giving the NW relation), might be vertically aligned with z (giving the W relation), or could be south of z (giving the SW relation). 

And that's all the cases.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is S of region z

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Let me analyze each relationship:

For x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

For y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

Checking each possible relation:

1. W relation: 
   - x can be west of z and vertically aligned with it
   - This is possible when x is west of y, y is horizontally within z, and x is vertically aligned with z

2. NW relation:
   - x can be northwest of z (both north and west)
   - This is possible when x is northwest of y and y is south of z

3. SW relation:
   - x can be southwest of z (both south and west)
   - This is possible when x is west of y but positioned such that it's south of z

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are not possible due to the constraints.

The answer is: W, NW, SW
