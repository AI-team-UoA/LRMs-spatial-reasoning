PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

First, let's understand what we know:
- Region x is B of region y. This means that x is in the bounding box of y.
- Region y is E of region z. This means that y is to the East of z.

From the definitions given:
- x B y means: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y E z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, I need to determine which relations could possibly hold between x and z.

Let's think about the bounding boxes of x, y, and z, and their positions relative to each other.

Since y is E of z, we know that y is entirely to the right of z, with supx(z) ≤ infx(y). Also, y's y-coordinates are within the range of z's y-coordinates, meaning infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Since x is B of y, we know that x is entirely within the bounding box of y, meaning infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z.

First, let's look at the x-coordinates:
- We know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) from y E z.
- We know infx(y) ≤ infx(x) from x B y.
- Therefore, supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
This means that x is entirely to the right of z, just like y is.

Next, let's look at the y-coordinates:
- We know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) from y E z.
- We know infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) from x B y.
- Therefore, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
This means that x's y-coordinates are bounded by z's y-coordinates in a specific way.

Given these constraints, it seems like x can be E of z or NE of z or SE of z. Let me double-check each:

1. x E z would mean:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (which we've established)
   So, x E z is a possible relation.

2. x NE z would mean:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   But we don't know if supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We only know that infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   So, x NE z might be a possible relation, depending on the exact positions.

3. x SE z would mean:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   But we don't know if supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We only know that supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   So, x SE z might be a possible relation, depending on the exact positions.

Actually, I think I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me reconsider carefully.

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let's combine these to determine the possible relations between x and z.

For the x-coordinate:
- From y E z, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
- From x B y, we know infx(y) ≤ infx(x).
- Therefore, supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
This means that x is entirely to the right of z, just like y is.

For the y-coordinate:
- From y E z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
- From x B y, we know infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- Therefore, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
This means that infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z could be:

1. x E z (East):
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (which we've established)
   So, x E z is a possible relation.

2. x NE z (Northeast):
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   
   But from our analysis, we have: infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We can't derive supy(z) ≤ infy(x) from these. In fact, if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then we'd have supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which leads to a contradiction unless infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z).
   Let me reconsider...

   Actually, there's no direct contradiction, so x NE z might be a valid relation under specific circumstances. Specifically, if y is very tall (supy(y) = supy(z)) and x is at the very top of y (infy(x) = supy(y)), then supy(z) = infy(x). In other cases, we'd have supy(z) > infy(x), which would rule out x NE z.

3. x SE z (Southeast):
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   
   But from our analysis, we have: infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then we'd have infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which leads to a contradiction unless infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x).
   Let me reconsider...

   Actually, we might have infy(z) = infy(x) and supy(x) = infy(z) simultaneously only if infy(x) = supy(x), which means x is flat (has height 0). In that case, x SE z would be valid. Otherwise, there's a contradiction.

Let me redo my analysis in a more careful manner.

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's now determine all the possible constraints on x and z.

From the x-coordinate:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

From the y-coordinate:
1. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), implies infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
2. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), implies supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z and check if it's consistent with the constraints:

1. x B z:
   - This would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - But we also know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the requirement infx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - So, x B z is not possible.

2. x S z:
   - This would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - But we know infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means it's not possible to have supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) simultaneously (unless x has zero height, but that's a special case).
   - So, x S z is not generally possible.

Let me continue checking the other relations:

3. x SW z:
   - This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - But we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - So, x SW z is not possible.

4. x W z:
   - This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - But we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z:
   - This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - But we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - So, x NW z is not possible.

6. x N z:
   - This would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which satisfies the constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - But we're not sure if supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - And more importantly, we don't know if supy(z) ≤ infy(x). In fact, from our constraints, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which might contradict the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (unless x and z have positions that allow for it).
   - So, x N z might be possible, but only under specific conditions.

I think I'm not being careful enough with this problem. Let me try a geometric approach to visualize the constraints.

Given:
- x B y means x is entirely within the bounding box of y.
- y E z means y is entirely to the right of z, with y's y-extent being within z's y-extent.

Let's consider the constraints again. For clarity, let's denote the bounding box of a region r as bb(r).

From x B y:
- bb(x) is entirely contained within bb(y).

From y E z:
- bb(y) is entirely to the right of bb(z).
- The y-extent of bb(y) is contained within the y-extent of bb(z).

Now, for region x, considering the constraints:
- bb(x) is entirely contained within bb(y).
- bb(y) is entirely to the right of bb(z).
- Therefore, bb(x) is entirely to the right of bb(z). This satisfies the x-coordinate constraint of relations E, NE, and SE.

- The y-extent of bb(y) is contained within the y-extent of bb(z).
- bb(x) is entirely contained within bb(y).
- Therefore, the y-extent of bb(x) is also contained within the y-extent of bb(z). This satisfies the y-coordinate constraint of relation E.

For relation NE (Northeast):
- bb(x) is entirely to the right of bb(z). (satisfied)
- For the y-coordinate, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- But our constraints only tell us that the y-extent of bb(x) is contained within the y-extent of bb(z). This means infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- For x NE z to be possible, we'd need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts our derived constraint infy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x NE z is not generally possible.

Similarly, for relation SE (Southeast):
- bb(x) is entirely to the right of bb(z). (satisfied)
- For the y-coordinate, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- But our constraints tell us infy(z) ≤ infy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (unless x has zero height). So, x SE z is not generally possible.

For relation E (East):
- bb(x) is entirely to the right of bb(z). (satisfied)
- For the y-coordinate, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). These are precisely the constraints we've derived. So, x E z is possible.

I need to reconsider the relations N, NE, and SE more carefully. Let me distinguish between "generally" possible and "possibly" possible. A relation is "generally" possible if it's consistent with the constraints for any regions satisfying x B y and y E z. A relation is "possibly" possible if there exists a specific configuration of regions x, y, and z satisfying x B y and y E z that can satisfy the relation.

Let's consider relation NE (Northeast):
- For x NE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- From our constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which satisfies the first requirement.
- For the second requirement, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
- For x NE z to be possible, we'd need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Can this be consistent with our constraints? Well, if supy(z) = supy(y) and infy(x) = supy(y), then we'd have supy(z) = infy(x), making it possible.
- So, while x NE z is not "generally" possible, it can be "possibly" possible under specific conditions.

Similarly, let's consider relation SE (Southeast):
- For x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- From our constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which satisfies the first requirement.
- For the second requirement, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
- For x SE z to be possible, we'd need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Can this be consistent with our constraints? Well, if infy(z) = infy(y) and supy(x) = infy(y), then we'd have supy(x) = infy(z), making it possible.
- So, while x SE z is not "generally" possible, it can be "possibly" possible under specific conditions.

Let's consider relation N (North):
- For x N z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- From our constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which satisfies infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- For the third requirement, we'd need supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But from our constraints, we can't directly derive a relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). We only know supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- For the first requirement, we'd need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Can this be consistent with our constraints? Well, from our constraints, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). It's not immediately apparent if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible.
- Let's think geometrically: If y is at the very top of z (supy(y) = supy(z)) and x is at the very top of y (infy(x) = supy(y)), then we'd have supy(z) = infy(x), making it possible.
- So, while x N z is not "generally" possible, it might be "possibly" possible under specific conditions.

Actually, let me check the definition of N one more time:

a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

So for x N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Now let's see if these can be satisfied if x B y and y E z.

First, from z E y, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

And from x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Now, for the x-coordinates in x N z:
- We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x). From our constraints, we have infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which satisfies this.
- We need supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We know supx(x) ≤ supx(y), but we don't have a direct relationship between supx(y) and supx(z).

Actually, from y E z, we know y is entirely to the right of z. So, there's no direct constraint saying supx(y) ≤ supx(z) or vice versa. Given the other constraints, both supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and supx(z) ≤ supx(y) could be possible depending on the exact regions.

For the y-coordinates in x N z:
- We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). From our constraints, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
- It's not immediately clear if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is consistent with these. But geometrically, if y is at the very top of z and x is at the very top of y, it could be possible. 

Actually, let's explicitly check if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) can be satisfied. From our constraints, we have:
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

For supy(z) ≤ infy(x) to be true, we would need:
supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Combining with our constraints:
supy(y) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This implies supy(y) ≤ infy(x). Can this be satisfied? Given that y is a region, its upper bound is greater than or equal to its lower bound: infy(y) ≤ supy(y). If infy(y) = infy(x) and infy(y) = supy(y), then we'd have supy(y) = infy(x), making it possible.

But this is a very specific (and possibly edge) case where the region y is essentially a horizontal line at the exact y-coordinate of the lower bound of x.

So, while x N z is not "generally" possible, it might be "possibly" possible under specific (and somewhat restrictive) conditions.

Let's now check relation NE:

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The first condition is satisfied from our constraints. For the second condition, the same argument applies as for relation N. It might be "possibly" possible under specific conditions, but not "generally" possible.

Let's check relation SE:

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

The first condition is satisfied from our constraints. For the second condition, we have:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For supy(x) ≤ infy(z) to be true, we would need:
supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Combining with our constraints:
supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This implies supy(x) ≤ infy(x). Can this be satisfied? Given that x is a region, its upper bound is greater than or equal to its lower bound: infy(x) ≤ supy(x). If infy(x) = supy(x), then x is essentially a horizontal line.

So, x SE z might be "possibly" possible under specific (and restrictive) conditions, but not "generally" possible.

Let me continue checking the other relations:

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

The second condition is satisfied from our constraints. For the third condition, as I discussed earlier, the relationship between supx(y) and supx(z) is not directly constrained, so supx(x) ≤ supx(z) could be satisfied or not, depending on the exact regions.

For the first condition, the same argument applies as for relation SE. It might be "possibly" possible under specific (and restrictive) conditions, but not "generally" possible.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

The first and third conditions are satisfied from our constraints. The fourth condition is also satisfied.

However, the second condition needs supx(x) ≤ supx(z). From our constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y), but as I discussed earlier, the relationship between supx(y) and supx(z) is not directly constrained. It could be that supx(y) ≤ supx(z), in which case supx(x) ≤ supx(z) would be satisfied.

But we also know that supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). This implies supx(z) ≤ supx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ supx(z) for x B z.

So, x B z is not generally possible.

Alright, I've checked all the possible relation. Let me summarize the findings.

For x and z, the "generally" possible relation is:
- E (East)

The relations that might be "possibly" possible under specific conditions are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- SE (Southeast)
- S (South)

The relations that are not possible are:
- B (Bounding box)
- SW (Southwest)
- W (West)
- NW (Northwest)

Let me double check my relation definition again to make sure I have the correct interpretation.

For our cardinal direction relations:

- E (East): a E b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).
- N (North): a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).
- S (South): a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).
- W (West): a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).
- NE (Northeast): a NE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).
- NW (Northwest): a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).
- SE (Southeast): a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).
- SW (Southwest): a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).
- B (Bounding box): a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, I need to check which of the relations above can hold between x and z.

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let me revisit each of the nine cardinal direction relations to check if they can hold between x and z.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given our constraints, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied.
We have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so the second condition is satisfied.
We have supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the third condition is satisfied.

Hence, x E z is consistent with our constraints.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Given our constraints, we have infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the second condition is satisfied.
For the third condition, we need supx(x) ≤ supx(z). From our constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y), but we don't have a direct relation between supx(y) and supx(z). The relation y E z doesn't constrain supx(y) relative to supx(z). It only requires supx(z) ≤ infx(y), so supx(y) can be larger or smaller than supx(z).

Actually, let's think about the east relation a bit more. a E b means that a is entirely to the east of b. The east relation doesn't say anything about which of the two regions has the rightmost extent.

Similarly, for the north relation, it doesn't say anything about which region has the rightmost extent. It's entirely about the vertical relationship.

So, for the x N z relationship, supx(x) can be lesser or greater than supx(z). But from our constraints, we're not guaranteed that supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, I'm inclined to say that x N z is not guaranteed to hold.

For the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). So, we're not guaranteed that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

In fact, if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then we'd have supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(y) = supy(z). This is a very specific condition where x, y, and z have very specific alignments.

So, x N z is possible, but only under very specific conditions.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Given our constraints, we have infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the second condition is satisfied.
For the third condition, as discussed, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is not guaranteed.
For the first condition, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). So, we're not guaranteed that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

In fact, if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then we'd have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means infy(z) = infy(y) = infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z). This is a very specific condition where x, y, and z have very specific alignments.

So, x S z is possible, but only under very specific conditions.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given our constraints, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so the second condition is satisfied.
We have supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the third condition is satisfied.
For the first condition, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). So, we're not guaranteed that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). In fact, our constraints suggest that infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x), which means supx(x) ≥ infx(z), contradicting the requirement for x W z.

So, x W z is not consistent with our constraints.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Given our constraints, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied.
For the second condition, as discussed for the x N z relation, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) can only be satisfied under very specific conditions.

So, x NE z is possible, but only under very specific conditions.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

For the first condition, as discussed for the x W z relation, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is not consistent with our constraints.
For the second condition, as discussed, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible only under very specific conditions.

So, x NW z is not consistent with our constraints.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Given our constraints, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied.
For the second condition, as discussed for the x S z relation, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) can only be satisfied under very specific conditions.

So, x SE z is possible, but only under very specific conditions.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

For the first condition, as discussed for the x W z relation, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is not consistent with our constraints.
For the second condition, as discussed, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is possible only under very specific conditions.

So, x SW z is not consistent with our constraints.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given our constraints, we have infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied.
For the second condition, as discussed, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is not guaranteed and can be satisfied or not based on the specific regions.
We have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so the third condition is satisfied.
We have supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the fourth condition is satisfied.

So, x B z is possible but not guaranteed. It depends on whether supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which is not constrained by the given relations x B y and y E z.

Wait, let's double-check this. We have from the constraint that supx(z) ≤ infx(y), this means that the right boundary of z is to the left of the left boundary of y.

Moreover, from x B y, we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x), meaning the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of y. 

Combining these two, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means the right boundary of z is to the left of the left boundary of x.

Now, for x B z to be possible, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left of the right boundary of z).

But we've just shown that supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means that the right boundary of z is to the left of the left boundary of x. For x B z to be possible, we'd need infx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

Given supx(z) ≤ infx(x), we'd have supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which implies supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z). This is a very restrictive condition where x is basically a vertical line segment at the exact x-coordinate of the right boundary of z.

So, x B z is possible but only under very restrictive conditions.

Let me recheck and summarize my findings.

For region x and z, given that region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z:

1. x E z is generally possible and is the most natural relation given the constraints.
2. x N z, x NE z, x S z, x SE z, and x B z are possible but only under very specific (and restrictive) conditions.
3. x W z, x NW z, and x SW z are not possible given the constraints.

Since the question asks for the "possible" relations, the answer seems to be:
E, N, NE, S, SE, B.

Actually, I want to be more careful about the B relation. For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given our constraints, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), meaning the right boundary of z is to the left of the left boundary of x.

For x B z to be possible, we also need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is fine, and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

But now, consider the implications:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) from our constraints.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) for x B z to be possible.

This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), leading to supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z). Hmm, let me think about what the means geometrically...

if the right boundary of z is the exact same as the left boundary of x and the right boundary of x, it's like x is a vertical line segment at the exact x-coordinate of the right boundary of z.

Actually, I think this specific setup is too restrictive (region x needs to have 0 width), so I'm going to classify "B" as not possible, especially since regions are supposed to be homeomorphic to the closed unit disk.

So, the answer is: E, N, NE, S, SE.

Actually, let's try it again from scratch with a slightly different approach. Suppose that region x is in relation B with region y, and region y is in relation E with region z. We want to know which relationships can possibly hold between region x and region z.

For the B relation:
- x B y means the bounding box of x is completely within the bounding box of y.

For the E relation:
- y E z means y is entirely to the east of z, with the y-extent of y being within the y-extent of z.

Given these relationships, let's determine what we know about the relative positions of x and z:

1. x-coordinate:
   - From y E z, we know that the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of y: supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
   - From x B y, we know that the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x).
   - Therefore, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x. This means x is entirely to the right of z.

2. y-coordinate:
   - From y E z, we know that the bottom of y is above the bottom of z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y).
   - From y E z, we know that the top of y is below the top of z: supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
   - From x B y, we know that the bottom of x is above the bottom of y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   - From x B y, we know that the top of x is below the top of y: supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
   - Therefore, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means that the y-extent of x is within the y-extent of z, possibly touching at the boundaries.

Given these constraints, let's check each of the cardinal direction relations:

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom of x is above the bottom of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (the top of x is below the top of z)

All of these conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints, so x E z is a possible relation.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left of the right boundary of z)

Given our constraints, we have:
- infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the second condition is satisfied.
- The third condition is not necessarily satisfied because we don't know the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). But beyond that, for x to be entirely above z, we'd need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But from our constraints, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which implies supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(y) = supy(z). This is possible but restrictive.

So, x N z might be possible, but only under restrictive conditions.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is entirely below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left of the right boundary of z)

Given our constraints, we have:
- infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the second condition is satisfied.
- The third condition is not necessarily satisfied.
- For the first condition, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies infy(z) = infy(y) = infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z). This is possible but restrictive.

So, x S z might be possible, but only under restrictive conditions.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom of x is above the bottom of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (the top of x is below the top of z)

Given our constraints, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the second and third conditions are satisfied.
However, for the first condition, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x), which implies infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

So, x W z is not possible given the constraints.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely above z)

Given our constraints, supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied.
For the second condition, as discussed for x N z, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) might be possible but is restrictive.

So, x NE z might be possible, but only under restrictive conditions.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely above z)

As discussed for x W z, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is not possible given the constraints.
And as discussed for x N z, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) might be possible but is restrictive.

So, x NW z is not possible given the constraints.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is entirely below z)

Given our constraints, supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied.
For the second condition, as discussed for x S z, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) might be possible but is restrictive.

So, x SE z might be possible, but only under restrictive conditions.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is entirely below z)

As discussed for x W z, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is not possible given the constraints.
And as discussed for x S z, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) might be possible but is restrictive.

So, x SW z is not possible given the constraints.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left of the right boundary of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom of x is above the bottom of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (the top of x is below the top of z)

Given our constraints, infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied.
We have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so the third condition is satisfied.
We have supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the fourth condition is satisfied.

However, for the second condition, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). This means supx(z) ≤ supx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ supx(z) unless supx(z) = supx(x), which is a very restrictive condition.

So, x B z might be technically possible, but only under a rare boundary condition (e.g., region x is a flat vertical line with width 0). But I think it's more reasonably categorized as "not possible," especially given the definition of regions in REG as being homeomorphic to the closed unit disk (i.e., regions can't be lines with width 0).

In summary, given the constraints of region x being B of region y and region y being E of region z:

1. x E z is generally possible.
2. x N z, x NE z, x S z, and x SE z might be possible, but only under restrictive conditions.
3. x W z, x NW z, x SW z, and x B z are not possible.

Since the question asks for the "possible" relations, the answer seems to be:
E, N, NE, S, SE.

Maybe there's a cleaner approach to this problem. Let me think through it once more.

When x is B of y, it means that box(x) ⊆ box(y).
When y is E of z, it means that y is entirely to the right of z, and the y-coordinates of y are contained within the y-coordinates of z.

From these, we can deduce:

1. x is entirely to the right of z (because y is to the right of z, and x is within the bounding box of y).
2. The y-coordinates of x are contained within the y-coordinates of y, which in turn are contained within the y-coordinates of z.

Given these constraints, let's reconsider each of the cardinal direction relations:

1. x E z: x is entirely to the right of z, and the y-coordinates of x are within the y-coordinates of z. This is consistent with our derived constraints. So, x E z is possible.

2. x N z: x is entirely above z. But from our constraints, we know that the y-coordinates of x are contained within the y-coordinates of z. For x to be entirely above z, the top boundary of z must be aligned with the bottom boundary of x, which is a restrictive condition. So, x N z might be possible under specific conditions, but not generally.

3. x S z: x is entirely below z. Similar to the analysis for x N z, this might be possible under specific conditions, but not generally.

4. x W z: x is entirely to the left of z. But from our constraints, we know that x is entirely to the right of z. This contradicts the requirement for x W z. So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NE z: x is entirely to the right and above z. While the "entirely to the right" part is consistent with our constraints, the "entirely above" part would require the top boundary of z to be aligned with the bottom boundary of x, which is a restrictive condition. So, x NE z might be possible under specific conditions, but not generally.

6. x NW z: x is entirely to the left and above z. The "entirely to the left" part contradicts our derived constraints. So, x NW z is not possible.

7. x SE z: x is entirely to the right and below z. Again, while the "entirely to the right" part is consistent with our constraints, the "entirely below" part would require the bottom boundary of z to be aligned with the top boundary of x, which is a restrictive condition. So, x SE z might be possible under specific conditions, but not generally.

8. x SW z: x is entirely to the left and below z. The "entirely to the left" part contradicts our derived constraints. So, x SW z is not possible.

9. x B z: x is entirely contained within the bounding box of z. Given our constraints, we know that x is entirely to the right of z. This implies that the right boundary of z is to the left of the left boundary of x, which contradicts the requirement for x B z. So, x B z is not possible (outside of some exotic edge cases involving degenerate regions).

So my final answer is:

The possible relations between x and z are: E, N, NE, S, SE.

Among these, E is the most general and natural, while N, NE, S, and SE require more specific alignments of the regions.

ANSWER:

Based on the given definitions and the conditions, I'll determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is E of region z

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) → x is entirely to the right of z
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) → bottom of x is above bottom of z
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) → top of x is below top of z

Checking each relation:
- E: All requirements satisfied (x is right of z, y-extent of x within z)
- NE: Possible in special case where supy(z) = infy(x)
- SE: Possible in special case where supy(x) = infy(z)
- N: Possible in special case where supy(z) = infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- S: Possible in special case where supy(x) = infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

The answer is: E, NE, SE, N, S
