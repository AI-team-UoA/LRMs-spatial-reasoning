PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this problem step by step. 

We are given that:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is W of region z

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

First, let's recall what these relations mean in terms of the bounding box coordinates:

x is N of y means: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

y is W of z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, I'll try to determine the relation between x and z by combining these constraints.

From x is N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is not completely to the left of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x is not completely to the right of y)

From y is W of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (y is not completely above z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y is not completely below z)

Now, let's try to determine constraints between x and z:

From the first set: supx(x) <= supx(y)
From the second set: supx(y) <= infx(z)
Therefore: supx(x) <= infx(z)  (this means x is to the left of z, satisfying the W relation)

From the first set: supy(y) <= infy(x)
From the second set: supy(y) <= supy(z)
These don't directly give us a constraint between infy(x) and any bound of z.

It's clear that x must be to the left of z (satisfying the W relation component), but we need to determine the vertical relationship.

If we look at the constraints:
- x is above y
- y is at the same height or below z (but not completely above)

This means x could be NW of z if it's above z. But x could also be W of z if it overlaps with z vertically. In some cases, x could even be SW of z if it's below z (though this would require specific arrangements).

Let me try to visualize a few scenarios to see the possible relationships:

Scenario 1: x is NW of z
```
    x
      y z
```
Here, x is above y, y is to the left of z, and x ends up being to the northwest of z.

Scenario 2: x is W of z
```
    x z
      y
```
Here, x is above y, y is to the left of z, and x ends up being directly west of z because they overlap vertically.

Scenario 3: x is N of z
```
    x
    z y
```
This scenario doesn't seem valid. If y is W of z, then y cannot be to the right of z.

Wait, I made an error. Let me reconsider the constraints:

From y is W of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (y is not completely above z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y is not completely below z)

The second constraint means z can extend below y. The third constraint means z can extend above y.

Let me revisit the scenarios:

Scenario 1: x is NW of z
```
    x
      y z
```
Here, x is N of y, y is W of z, and x ends up being NW of z.

Scenario 2: x is W of z
```
    x
    z y
```
Here, x is N of y, y is W of z, and x overlaps vertically with z, making x W of z.

Scenario 3: x is N of z
```
    x
  z
    y
```
Here, x is N of y, y is W of z, but z extends to the left of y such that x is directly N of z.

Wait, I made an error again. Let me be more precise and really think through what the formal definitions are letting z's position be relative to y, and then what x's position can be relative to z.

Given y is W of z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (z can extend below y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (z can extend above y)

Now, given x is N of y, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)  (x can extend to the right of y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x can extend to the left of y's right edge)

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z) implies supx(x) <= infx(z), meaning x is to the left of z.
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z) doesn't give a clear vertical relationship between x and z.

To determine the possible relationships, I'll consider the various ways x can be positioned relative to z vertically:

1. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is above z, making x NW of z.
2. If infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(z), then x and z overlap vertically, making x W of z.
3. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is below z, making x SW of z.

Let me check if each of these is possible given the constraints:

For case 1 (x is NW of z):
Constraints: supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
Is it possible to have infy(x) > supy(z)? 
If supy(z) is only slightly larger than supy(y), and infy(x) is significantly larger than supy(y), then yes, infy(x) > supy(z) is possible. So, x can be NW of z.

For case 2 (x is W of z):
Constraints: supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
Is it possible to have infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(z)?
Yes, if infy(x) is close to supy(y) and infy(z) is close to infy(y), then there could be a vertical overlap between x and z, making x W of z.

For case 3 (x is SW of z):
Constraints: supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
Is it possible to have supy(x) < infy(z)?
This seems contradictory. If supy(y) <= infy(x), then y is below x. And if infy(z) <= infy(y), then z is below or at the same level as y. This would mean z is below x, making x N or NW of z, not SW.

Let me reconsider case 3. If infy(z) is much larger than infy(y), and infy(x) is only slightly larger than supy(y), it might be possible for supy(x) < infy(z). But I'm not convinced yet.

Let's try a more systematic approach:

Given y is W of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (z can extend below y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (z can extend above y)

Given x is N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)  (x can extend to the right of y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x can extend to the left of y's right edge)

For the horizontal relationship between x and z:
From supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we get supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This restricts the possible relations to NW, W, and SW.

For the vertical relationship between x and z:
From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we don't get a direct constraint between x and z. However, from infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we get infy(z) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This means z's bottom is below x's bottom.

Now, there are a few scenarios:

1. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is below z. This seems contradictory with infy(z) <= infy(x), as it would mean infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) < infy(z).

2. If infy(z) <= supy(x) and supy(x) < supy(z), then x and z overlap vertically, but z extends above x.

3. If supy(z) <= supy(x), then x extends above z.

Wait, I'm being careless. The constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) means z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom. It doesn't directly constrain the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).

Let me reapproach this:

Given y is W of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (z can extend below y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (z can extend above y)

Given x is N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)  (x can extend to the right of y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x can extend to the left of y's right edge)

Horizontally, x is to the left of z (as we established, supx(x) <= infx(z)).

Vertically, we have the following constraints from the given conditions:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (z can extend below y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (z can extend above y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)

From these, we can't directly determine the vertical relationship between x and z. Thus, all three scenarios (x is NW of z, x is W of z, and x is SW of z) seems possible.

But let me double-check the SW scenario:
If x is SW of z, then supy(x) <= infy(z).
From the constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x).
Therefore, supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z).
But we also know infy(z) <= infy(y).
This would mean infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies infy(y) = supy(y) = infy(z).
This is a very restrictive condition and would make y a horizontal line segment.

So, if we're considering general regions, it's more likely that x is NW or W of z.

Let me try once more to be extra precise.

Given y is W of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (z can extend below y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (z can extend above y)

Given x is N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)  (x can extend to the right of y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x can extend to the left of y's right edge)

For the SW scenario:
if x is SW of z, then supy(x) <= infy(z). But we also know supy(y) <= infy(x). This gives supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

Also, from y is W of z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y). 

Combine supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), and we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)

This doesn't seem to contradict supy(x) <= infy(z). But if we arrange them, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z)

Which implies infy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y) = infy(x) = supy(x), which is very restrictive and would make both x and y horizontal line segments. 

But I realize there's an error in the above derivation. The condition "x is SW of z" doesn't imply supy(x) <= infy(z). It implies supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b). So, the correct implication is supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). And we already know from the constraints that supx(x) <= infx(z).

So, for the SW scenario, we need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is consistent with the given constraints. One of the constraints is supy(y) <= infy(x), which means y is below x. Another constraint is infy(z) <= infy(y), which means z can extend below y. 

If infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), it's consistent with supy(x) <= infy(z) only if infy(z) >= supy(x). But we also have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which means infy(z) <= supy(x). For both infy(z) >= supy(x) and infy(z) <= supy(x) to be true, infy(z) must equal supy(x).

Again, this is a very restrictive condition. So, while the SW scenario is technically possible, it's much more likely that x is NW or W of z.

Actually, I made a mistake earlier on "x is SW of z" again. Let me get back to the exact definition: a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b). So for x SW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We already established supx(x) <= infx(z).

For supy(x) <= infy(z), we have the constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (z can extend below y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)

If infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), then infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This would mean infy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be SW of z.

So, the SW scenario is not valid. The possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

Wait, let me double-check:
The constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) allows z to **extend below** y; it doesn't mean z must be below y. If infy(z) = infy(y), z and y start at the same level. If infy(z) < infy(y), z extends below y.

So it's possible that infy(z) > supy(y), which means z is entirely above y. But from supy(y) <= supy(z), we know y's top is below or at the same level as z's top. Given supy(y) <= infy(x), x is above y.

If infy(z) > supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), x and z can have no vertical overlap, with x above y and z above y but to the right of y. In this case, x and z could be N or NW of z, depending on the exact positions.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let's go back to the definitions:

y is W of z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

These conditions mean:
1. y is entirely to the left of z.
2. The bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y.
3. The top of y is below or at the same level as the top of z.

Conditions 2 and 3 together mean z can "contain" y vertically, but not the other way around.

x is N of y means: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

These conditions mean:
1. x is entirely above y.
2. The left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of y.
3. The right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of y.

Conditions 2 and 3 together mean x is "contained" horizontally by y, but not the other way around.

Given these interpretations:
- y is to the left of z, and z can vertically contain y.
- x is above y, and y horizontally contains x.

Now, let's trace the possible positions of x relative to z:

Horizontally:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is entirely to the left of z.

Vertically:
- If infy(z) > supy(y) and infy(x) > supy(y), x and z don't overlap vertically. Given supy(y) <= supy(z), z's top could be anywhere above y's top. Similarly, x's top could be anywhere above its bottom. So, x can be N, NW, or NE of z. But since x is entirely to the left of z, NE is eliminated, and N or NW are possibilities and, in fact, I already ruled out N above.
- If infy(z) <= supy(y) and x is above y, then x and z might overlap vertically. In this case, x can be W of z.
- If supy(x) <= infy(z), x would be SW of z. But, as we established earlier, this would require very restrictive conditions like thinning y to a flat horizontal line segment. So, while SW is a technical possibility, it's an edge case.

Wait, I'm making mistakes. Let me slow down a reason carefully through the possible relationships.

Given:
- x is N of y
- y is W of z

We want to know the possible relations between x and z.

For x to be N of y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)  (x's left edge is to the right of or at the same position as y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x's right edge is to the left of or at the same position as y's right edge)

For y to be W of z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y's top is below or at the same level as z's top)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Given this horizontal relationship, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are NW, W, and SW.

Now, let's examine the vertical relationship:

1. For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   But we are only given:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y's top is below or at the same level as z's top)
   
   From these, we can't definitely say if supy(z) <= infy(x). Z's top could be above x's bottom, or below x's bottom.
   
   So, NW is a possibility, depending on the actual measurements.

2. For x to be W of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   We are given:
   - infy(z) <= infy(y)  (z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y's top is below or at the same level as z's top)
   
   From these, we can deduce:
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
   
   This means z's bottom is below x's bottom. If z's top is also above x's top, then x and z would have a vertical overlap, making x W of z.
   
   So, W is a possibility, depending on the actual measurements.

3. For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   But we derived earlier:
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x)
   
   This means infy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be SW of z.
   
   So, SW is not a possibility.

Hmm, I'm getting confused again. Let me take a step back. I'm clearly having trouble with tracing the relationship between x and z. But notice that we know x is N of y, we can draw out the relative positions:

```
  x
  y
```

And since y is W of z, we can add z:

```
  x
  y   z
```

So it's clear that x is NW of z.

But there is a mistake. The definition of cardinal direction allows more flexible positions. Let's really make sure I understand the definitions more precisely.

When we say "x is N of y," y is the reference. The definition says:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

So, x is entirely above y, and y horizontally "contains" x.

Similarly, when we say "y is W of z," z is the reference. The definition says:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

So, y is entirely to the left of z, and z vertically "contains" y.

Now, let's place these regions:

For "x is N of y" and "y is W of z", we might have:

```
       x
       |
     __|___
    |      |
    |      |   z
    |  y   |   |
    |______|___|
        |
```

OR

```
   x
   |
 __|___
|      |
|      |        z
|  y   |        |
|______|________|
    |           |
    |___________|
```

OR many other arrangements.

In the first arrangement, x is NW of z, while in the second arrangement, x is W of z.

Let me analyze more formally:

For "x is N of y":
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x is horizontally "contained" by y)

For "y is W of z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y is vertically "contained" by z)

Combining these, we can say supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), meaning x is to the left of z.

Vertically, we know:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (z can extend below y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)  (z can extend above y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)

From these, while we can say infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), we can't precisely determine the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). If supy(z) < infy(x), x would be NW of z. If infy(x) <= supy(z), x would overlap vertically with z, making it W of z.

So, both NW and W are possible relations between x and z. Given the flexibility of the positions, it's hard to narrow it down further without specific measurements.

Let me check one more time to make sure NW and W are the only possible relations between x and z:

1. NW would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
2. W would require supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Checking other cardinal directions:

3. N would require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), along with supy(z) <= infy(x). But infx(z) <= infx(x) can't be guaranteed, since for this to happen, the left edge of z has to be to the left of (or at) the left edge of x. This would contradict the constraint supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which implies infx(z) > supx(x) >= infx(x). So, N is not a possible relation.

4. NE would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But this contradicts the constraint supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which implies infx(z) > supx(x) >= infx(x). So, NE is not a possible relation.

5. E would require supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the same constraint as above, so E is not a possible relation.

6. SE would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the same constraint as above, so SE is not a possible relation.

7. S would require infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the same constraint as above, so S is not a possible relation.

8. SW would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). As we established earlier, the constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be SW of z. So, SW is not a possible relation.

9. B would require infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the constraint supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), as it would imply infx(z) > supx(x) >= infx(x). So, B is not a possible relation.

So, from the analysis, NW and W are the only possible relations between x and z. And wait, maybe I underestimated the flexibility in the original definitions.

Let me go back to first principles: For "x is N of y", given the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x), x is placed above y. The constraints infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) ensure that x's left edge is to the right of or at the same position as y's left edge, and x's right edge is to the left of or at the same position as y's right edge. Basically, y horizontally "contains" x, but x can be displaced left or right within y's horizontal extent.

For "y is W of z", given the constraint supx(y) <= infx(z), y is placed to the left of z. The constraints infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) ensure that y's bottom is above or at the same position as z's bottom, and y's top is below or at the same position as z's top. Basically, z vertically "contains" y, but y can be displaced up or down within z's vertical extent.

Now, if y horizontally contains x and z vertically contains y, what can we say about x's position relative to z? 

Horizontally, x is contained within y's horizontal extent, and y is to the left of z. This means x is also to the left of z, which aligns with supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).

Vertically, y is contained within z's vertical extent, and x is above y. This means x can be above, overlap with, or be contained within z's vertical extent.

If x is above z's vertical extent, then x is NW of z. If x overlaps with or is contained within z's vertical extent, then x is W of z.

We need to check: can x be below z? If x is N of y, it's above y. If y is W of z, y is vertically contained within z. So, z can extend both above and below y. If z extends significantly below y, and x is just slightly above y, could x be below z (making x SW of z)?

From the constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)  (z can extend below y)

If infy(z) is less than infy(y) (z extends below y), and supy(y) is less than infy(x) (x is above y), we can't directly determine the relation between infy(z) and infy(x).

However, for x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). Given supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y), we know y's top is below x's bottom. For supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true, z's bottom would need to be above x's top, which means infy(z) >= supy(x).

But we also have infy(z) <= infy(y) (z can extend below y). These two conditions (infy(z) >= supy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)) can hold true only if supy(x) <= infy(y), which contradicts the requirement that x is above y (supy(y) <= infy(x)).

So, x cannot be SW of z.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

I'm going to make one more attempt with an example to convince myself of the possible relations:

Let's consider specific regions:

Region y: (0,0) to (2,2)
Region z: (3,1) to (5,3)

In this configuration, y is W of z:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(z) = 3  (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 0  (z's bottom is above y's bottom)
- supy(y) = 2 <= supy(z) = 3  (y's top is below z's top)

Now, for region x to be N of y, it needs to be above y but horizontally contained within y's extent. Let's consider:

Region x: (0.5, 3) to (1.5, 4)

In this configuration, x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 3  (x is above y)
- infx(y) = 0 <= infx(x) = 0.5  (x's left edge is to the right of y's left edge)
- supx(x) = 1.5 <= supx(y) = 2  (x's right edge is to the left of y's right edge)

Given these specific regions, what is the relation between x and z?

Horizontally, supx(x) = 1.5 <= infx(z) = 3, so x is to the left of z.
Vertically, supy(z) = 3 = infy(x), so z's top is at the same level as x's bottom. According to the definition of NW, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), which is met here (as equality). So, in this example, x is NW of z.

Now, let's modify region x slightly:

Region x: (0.5, 2.5) to (1.5, 3.5)

In this configuration, x is still N of y:
- supy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2.5  (x is above y)
- infx(y) = 0 <= infx(x) = 0.5  (x's left edge is to the right of y's left edge)
- supx(x) = 1.5 <= supx(y) = 2  (x's right edge is to the left of y's right edge)

Given these new regions, what is the relation between x and z?

Horizontally, supx(x) = 1.5 <= infx(z) = 3, so x is to the left of z.
Vertically, infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2.5 and supy(x) = 3.5 > supy(z) = 3. This means x and z overlap vertically, with x's bottom above z's bottom and x's top above z's top. According to the definition of W, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two conditions are met, but not the third (since supy(x) = 3.5 > supy(z) = 3). So, in this example, I don't think x is W of z!

However, I defined W as:
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

With a = x and b = z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
With the new region x, the first two conditions are met, but the last isn't.

But I realize that I don't need for all of these conditions to be met. That would imply only a specific cardinal direction, W. There might be other directions!

Let's check the cardinal directions for a = x and b = z:

1. B (bounding box): infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   In the example, infx(z) = 3 > infx(x) = 0.5, so B is not the correct direction.

2. S (south): supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   In the example, infy(z) = 1 < supy(x) = 3.5, so S is not the correct direction.

3. SW (southwest): supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   In the example, infy(z) = 1 < supy(x) = 3.5, so SW is not the correct direction.

4. W (west): supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   In the example, supx(x) = 1.5 <= infx(z) = 3 and infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2.5, but supy(x) = 3.5 > supy(z) = 3. So, W is not the correct direction.

5. NW (northwest): supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   In the example, supx(x) = 1.5 <= infx(z) = 3, but supy(z) = 3 > infy(x) = 2.5. So, NW is not the correct direction.

6. N (north): supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   In the example, supy(z) = 3 > infy(x) = 2.5, so N is not the correct direction.

7. NE (northeast): supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   In the example, infx(x) = 0.5 < supx(z) = 5, so NE is not the correct direction.

8. E (east): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   In the example, infx(x) = 0.5 < supx(z) = 5, so E is not the correct direction.

9. SE (southeast): supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   In the example, infx(x) = 0.5 < supx(z) = 5 and infy(z) = 1 < supy(x) = 3.5, so SE is not the correct direction.

This is odd. None of the 9 cardinal directions match! I must have made a mistake. I'm going to revisit:

```
For the modified region x: (0.5, 2.5) to (1.5, 3.5) and z: (3,1) to (5,3).

Horizontally, supx(x) = 1.5 <= infx(z) = 3, so x is to the left of z.
Vertically, we have:
- infy(x) = 2.5 > infy(z) = 1  (x's bottom is above z's bottom)
- supy(x) = 3.5 > supy(z) = 3  (x's top is above z's top)
```

This means x is entirely to the northwest of z. It's not one of the pure cardinal directions.

But wait, that doesn't make sense since the cardinal directions are supposed to cover all possible 2D arrangements. Let me double-check:

The NW (northwest) relation is defined as:
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

For NW to hold, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the left of z)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z)

In the case of the modified region x:
supx(x) = 1.5 <= infx(z) = 3  ✓
supy(z) = 3 > infy(x) = 2.5  ✗

Wait, I realized that infy and supy are standard min and max projections on the y-axis.

For the modified region x: (0.5, 2.5) to (1.5, 3.5):
- infy(x) = 2.5 (minimum y-value of x)
- supy(x) = 3.5 (maximum y-value of x)

For region z: (3,1) to (5,3):
- infy(z) = 1 (minimum y-value of z)
- supy(z) = 3 (maximum y-value of z)

For NW to hold, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), which would mean 3 <= 2.5. But 3 > 2.5, so the NW relation doesn't hold.

I'm trying to determine what the relation is, if it's not one of the nine cardinal directions:

Horizontally, x is to the left of z, which suggests W, NW, or SW.
Vertically, there's a degree of overlap, with x's bottom being above z's bottom but its top extending above z's top.

Wait, I remember a rule for cardinal directions: If regions don't neatly fall into one of the nine directions, we consider multi-tile directions, possibly as a union. So, in the case of the modified region x, it's neither purely W nor purely NW but could be a combination of W and NW.

But that makes me realize that we are looking for a precise definition of the directions.

I think a more precise way is to define the direction based on the position of one region relative to the minimum bounding box of the other.

For the original region x: (0.5, 3) to (1.5, 4):
- Horizontally, it's entirely to the left of z.
- Vertically, it's entirely above or at the same level as z.
This makes it NW of z.

For the modified region x: (0.5, 2.5) to (1.5, 3.5):
- Horizontally, it's entirely to the left of z.
- Vertically, it overlaps with z's vertical extent.
This makes it a combination, specifically W:NW.

But since the region is completely to the left of z, and it's neither completely above nor completely below z, it's W (west) of z. 

Oh wait, I misunderstood the definition of W: 
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

For W to hold, we need:
1. x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)),
2. x's bottom is above or at the same level as z's bottom (infy(z) <= infy(x)),
3. x's top is below or at the same level as z's top (supy(x) <= supy(z)).

With the modified region x, the first and second conditions are met, but the third isn't (supy(x) = 3.5 > supy(z) = 3).

So, the modified region x is neither purely W nor purely NW of z. It's in a combined direction, specifically W:NW.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up some of the definitions and how they're used here. Let's think more precisely, given the original problem:

- If region x is N of region y and 
- region y is W of region z

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Tracing the constraints:
1. supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x is horizontally "contained" by y)
3. supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y is vertically "contained" by z)

Combining (2) and (3), we get supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This restricts the possible cardinal directions to NW, W, or SW.

For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). From (1) and (4), we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). 

If supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) <= infy(x), making x NW of z. 
If supy(z) > supy(y), we can't definitely say if supy(z) <= infy(x) without more specific measurements. However, if infy(x) is sufficiently high, then supy(z) might still be less than infy(x), making x NW of z.

For x to be W of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). From (1) and (4), we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y). 

This means infy(z) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), satisfying the first condition. For the second condition, we don't have direct constraints on supy(x) (by which I mean the upper y-value of region x). If supy(x) is less than or equal to supy(z), then x is W of z. If supy(x) > supy(z), then x is not purely W of z but is partially W and partially NW. This would be a combined direction, possibly W:NW.

For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But from the constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which implies infy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the requirement for SW. So, x cannot be SW of z.

Now, I'm trying to check if there are other combined directions possible. The horizontal constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) means x is to the left of z, eliminating the possibility of x being NE, E, SE, or in a B (bounding box) relation with z.

Vertically, we've established that x can be above z (making it NW of z) or can overlap with z (making it W of z, or possibly in a combined direction like W:NW). Given the strict constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), x cannot be below z, eliminating the possibility of a SW relation.

In conclusion, based on the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

Wait, let's check more carefully:
For x to be W of z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z)

We established:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) by combining the constraints from the horizontal directions.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) from the given constraints. This means infy(z) <= infy(x), satisfying the second condition.
- For the third condition, we don't have specific constraints on supy(x) from the given problem. If supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z. Otherwise, it's not.

So, the possible relations between x and z directly derivable from the constraints are NW and W. If we're asked about "pure" directions, not combined ones, then the answer would be NW, W. If we're asked about all possible directions, including combined ones, we need to consider the case where x is neither purely NW nor purely W.

Let me recheck the definitions. The problem asks for which "could be" the possible relations between region x and region z. Since the relations depend on the specific measurements which aren't fully constrained, I'm looking for the range of possible cardinal directions that could hold.

Based on the constraints derived from the given relations, x is without a doubt to the left of z, and its bottom is above z's bottom. The only variables are:
1. The relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) (which determines whether x is above z).
2. The relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) (which contributes to determining whether x is in a W or combined W:NW relation).

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NW of z.
If infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
If infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z), then x is in a combined W:NW relation.

Given that the problem asks for possible relations, and since the constraints allow for different arrangments of x, y, and z, the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

The combined direction W:NW might also be possible, but I'm not sure if that's considered a valid answer for this type of question. 

Let's conclude:
Given region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- NW (Northwest)
- W (West)

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is W of region z

First, I'll analyze what these statements tell us about the relative positions:

From x is N of y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally contained within y's extent)

From y is W of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is vertically contained within z's extent)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means bottom of x is above bottom of z

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

NW: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above z)
W: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x and z overlap vertically)

The possible relations are: NW, W
