PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's solve this step by step. I have the following:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is B of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall what these relations mean:

- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
  In other words, x is entirely to the left and below y.

- y B z means: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
  In other words, y is entirely inside the bounding box of z.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z.

From x SW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [x is to the left of y]
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  [x is below y]

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [z extends at least as far left as y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  [z extends at least as far right as y]
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)  [z extends at least as far down as y]
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)  [z extends at least as far up as y]

Now, I need to derive the relation between x and z:

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [from x SW y]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [from y B z]

We cannot directly determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) from these inequalities. It could be that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which would mean x is to the left of z. But it could also be that infx(z) ≤ supx(x), which would mean x and z overlap in the x-direction.

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  [from x SW y]
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)  [from y B z]

Again, we cannot directly determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It could be that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would mean x is below z. But it could also be that infy(z) ≤ supy(x), which would mean x and z overlap in the y-direction.

Let's consider different possible configurations:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x SW z.

2. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x W z.

3. If infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x S z.

4. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x B z.

5. If infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x might be in the interior of z, which could correspond to relation B.

Wait, I think I need to be more careful with my analysis. Let me reconsider what we know:

From x SW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [x is entirely to the left of y]
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  [x is entirely below y]

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [z extends at least as far left as y, or even further left]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  [z extends at least as far right as y, or even further right]
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)  [z extends at least as far down as y, or even further down]
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)  [z extends at least as far up as y, or even further up]

This means that z contains y, and z might extend beyond y in any or all directions.

Now, let's think about where x can be relative to z. Since x is entirely to the left and below y, and z can extend beyond y in any direction, we have the following possibilities:

1. If z does not extend to the left or below y, then x would be SW of z (since x is SW of y).

2. If z extends to the left past x but not below y, then x would be S of z.

3. If z extends below y past x but not to the left of y, then x would be W of z.

4. If z extends both to the left past x and below y past x, then x would be B of z (inside z).

Let me check if I'm missing any possibilities:

5. x can't be SE of z because x is entirely to the left of y, and z extends at least as far left as y.

6. x can't be E of z for the same reason.

7. x can't be NE of z because x is entirely below y, and z extends at least as far down as y.

8. x can't be N of z for the same reason.

9. x can't be NW of z because x is entirely to the left and below y, and z extends at least as far left as y and at least as far down as y.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, W, and B.

Actually, let me double-check this reasoning. The definition of the B relationship means that the reference region (in this case, z) contains the primary region (in this case, y) within its bounding box, but they're not necessarily the same region. It's possible that there are parts of the bounding box of z that are not covered by z itself.

Let's re-analyze:

From x SW y, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

From y B z, we have:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z based on these constraints.

For SW: x is SW of z if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
From what we know, we can't guarantee that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) because we only know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), which doesn't establish a clear ordering between supx(x) and infx(z).
Similarly, we can't guarantee that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) because we only know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), which doesn't establish a clear ordering between supy(x) and infy(z).

However, we can consider different scenarios based on the relative positions of y and z.

Case 1: If infx(z) = infx(y) and infy(z) = infy(y), then by transitivity, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x SW z.

Case 2: If infx(z) < infx(y) and infy(z) = infy(y), then the situation is more complex. Since z extends further left than y, it's possible that supx(x) > infx(z), in which case x would not be entirely to the left of z. However, x is still entirely below z. Depending on the exact configuration, x could be S, SW, or even overlap with z.

Case 3: If infx(z) = infx(y) and infy(z) < infy(y), then the situation is similar to Case 2 but in the vertical direction. Since z extends further down than y, it's possible that supy(x) > infy(z), in which case x would not be entirely below z. However, x is still entirely to the left of z. Depending on the exact configuration, x could be W, SW, or even overlap with z.

Case 4: If infx(z) < infx(y) and infy(z) < infy(y), then both of the issues from Cases 2 and 3 apply. Depending on the exact configuration, x could be SW, S, W, or even inside of z.

OK, let's re-check:
- If z is same bounding box as y, then based on the information given, x is SW of z.
- If z extends further left or further down (or both) than y, then the relationship between x and z can depend on how far z extends and the shape of z. If z extends far enough left and far enough down, it's possible that x is inside z (B relationship). Otherwise, x could be S, W, or SW of z, depending on the specific configuration.

Let's carefully analyse all possible relationships again:

1. SW: For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). As discussed, this is possible depending on the exact positions of y and z.

2. S: For x to be S of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Given that x is SW of y, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so the condition supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied. However, we don't know for sure that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) or that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). If infx(z) is small enough (i.e., z extends far enough to the left) and infy(z) is small enough (i.e., z extends far enough down), then x could be S of z.

3. W: For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given that x is SW of y, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied. However, we don't know for sure that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) or that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). If infx(z) is large enough (i.e., z doesn't extend too far to the left) and infy(z) is small enough (i.e., z extends far enough down), then x could be W of z.

4. B: For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given that x is SW of y, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so the condition supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied. Similarly, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied. However, we don't know for sure that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) or that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). If infx(z) is small enough (i.e., z extends far enough to the left) and infy(z) is small enough (i.e., z extends far enough down), then x could be B of z.

5. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Given that y B z, we know that supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). Given that x SW y, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y). So, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), but this doesn't necessarily imply supx(z) ≤ infx(x). In fact, since supx(y) ≤ supx(z), and supx(x) ≤ infx(y), it's more likely that supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts the requirement for x to be SE of z. So, x is unlikely to be SE of z.

Similarly, I could analyze the remaining relationships (NE, E, NW, N), but it may be more efficient to focus just on the possible relationships. Let me refine the analysis.

When I say "x is SW of y", I mean that x is entirely to the left of y (on the x-axis) and entirely below y (on the y-axis). This means that the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of y, and the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of y.

When I say "y is B of z", I mean that y is inside the bounding box of z. This means that the left edge of y is to the right of the left edge of z, the right edge of y is to the left of the right edge of z, the bottom edge of y is above the bottom edge of z, and the top edge of y is below the top edge of z.

Now, let's consider all the possible relationships:
SW: To say "x is SW of z", I need the right edge of x to be to the left of the left edge of z, and the top edge of x to be below the bottom edge of z.

We know:
- The right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of y (from x SW y).
- The left edge of y is to the right of the left edge of z (from y B z).

By transitivity, this doesn't necessarily imply that the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z. The right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of y, and the left edge of y is to the right of the left edge of z. This doesn't establish a relationship between the right edge of x and the left edge of z. So, we can't guarantee that x is to the left of z.

Similarly, we know:
- The top edge of x is below the bottom edge of y (from x SW y).
- The bottom edge of y is above the bottom edge of z (from y B z).

By transitivity, this doesn't necessarily imply that the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. So, we can't guarantee that x is below z.

This means that x is not necessarily SW of z. It could be, but we can't be sure based on the given information.

Now, let's consider the other relationships.

To determine if x is actually SW of z, we need to know that x is entirely to the left and below z. Given that x is SW of y and y is B of z, we know that x is entirely to the left and below y, and y is inside the bounding box of z. If z doesn't extend to the left past the left edge of y and doesn't extend below the bottom edge of y, then x would indeed be SW of z. But since z can potentially extend far to the left and far below y, x could be inside z (B relationship), or even S or W of z, depending on the exact configuration.

Ah, I think I need to clarify something: the B relationship means that one region is inside the bounding box of another, not necessarily inside the region itself. So, if y is B of z, it means y is inside the bounding box of z, but it doesn't mean that every point of the bounding box of z is part of the region z itself.

Alright, let's categorize the possible relationships between x and z:
S: Possible, if z extends far enough to the left to encompass x but doesn't extend far enough down to encompass x.
W: Possible, if z extends far enough down to encompass x but doesn't extend far enough to the left to encompass x.
SW: Possible, if z doesn't extend far enough to the left or far enough down to encompass x.
B: Possible, if z extends both far enough to the left and far enough down to encompass x.

So, the possible relationships are S, W, SW, and B.

Let's double-check by trying to visualize a concrete example.

Imagine a square grid, with coordinates from (0,0) to (10,10).

Suppose region y occupies the square from (5,5) to (7,7).
Then, since x is SW of y, x might occupy the square from (2,2) to (4,4).
Now, since y is B of z, the bounding box of z contains y. For simplicity, let's say the bounding box of z is from (3,3) to (9,9).

In this configuration, z's bounding box extends to the left past the right edge of x, and it extends below the top edge of x. If the region z itself (not just its bounding box) covers the entire area from (3,3) to (9,9), then x would be partially inside z, which would be a complex relationship, not one of the nine basic relationships. But remember, the B relationship is about the bounding box, not the region itself. So, the region z might be a ring-shaped region, which has a bounding box from (3,3) to (9,9), but the region itself doesn't cover the area where x is.

So, the relationship between x and z can be S, W, SW, or B, depending on the exact structure of the region z.

Wait, I think my intuition is leading me astray here. Let me try to be more precise with the definitions.

"a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b),"

This means that a is inside the bounding box of b. The inequality conditions delineate the bounding box of b, and say that a is inside it.

"y B z" means that y is inside the bounding box of z. It doesn't say anything about how much z extends beyond the bounding box of y (if at all).

Let's try another example to make sure I'm understanding this correctly.

Consider a region y which is a square from (3,3) to (5,5), and a region z which is a rectangle from (2,2) to (6,6). Since the bounding box of z completely contains the bounding box of y, "y B z" is true.

Now, consider a region x which is a square from (1,1) to (2,2). Since x is entirely to the left and below y, "x SW y" is true.

What's the relationship between x and z? Since the top-right corner of x (at (2,2)) touches the bottom-left corner of z (also at (2,2)), x is not entirely to the left and below z. In fact, x and z share a corner. This would be a more complex relationship, not one of the nine basic relationships.

But if we move x slightly to be from (0.5,0.5) to (1.5,1.5), then "x SW z" would be true because x is entirely to the left and below z.

Now, let's try another example. Keep y the same, but now z is a more complex shape. Its bounding box is still from (2,2) to (6,6), but z itself is a ring that circumscribes but doesn't include the area from (2.5,2.5) to (5.5,5.5). In this case, "y B z" is still true (because y is inside the bounding box of z), but y is not inside the region z itself.

For region x, consider it to be from (2,2) to (2.5,2.5). In this case, x is SW of y, and x is actually a subset of the region z (since the region z includes the point (2,2) but not the point (2.5,2.5)). So, x is "B" of z (in the sense that x is inside the region z), but this doesn't fit the "a B b" definition, because the definition is about the bounding box, not the region itself.

Hmm, the problem is a bit subtle, and I think I'm overthinking it. Let's make this more disciplined.

We have:
1. x SW y means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

2. y B z means:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let's directly define the various relations using these coordinates:

x SW z if:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

x S z if:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

x W z if:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

x B z if:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Now let's check each relationship with numbers to confirm our understanding:

Imagine:
- Region x: bounding box from (1,1) to (2,2)
- Region y: bounding box from (3,3) to (4,4)
- Region z: bounding box from (2,2) to (5,5)

For x SW y:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 3 ✓
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 3 ✓
So, x is SW of y.

For y B z:
- infx(z) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 3 ✓
- supx(y) = 4 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
- infy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 3 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
So, y is B of z.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

For x SW z:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 2 ✓ (Note that this is an equality, which is allowed by the "≤" symbol)
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(z) = 2 ✓ (Again, an equality, allowed by "≤")
So, x is SW of z.

For x S z:
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(z) = 2 ✓
- infx(z) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 1 ✗
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
Not satisfied.

For x W z:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 2 ✓
- infy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(x) = 1 ✗
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
Not satisfied.

For x B z:
- infx(z) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 1 ✗
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
- infy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(x) = 1 ✗
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
Not satisfied.

So, in this specific example, x is SW of z. But depending on the exact positions of the regions, other relationships could be possible.

Let's consider some more examples:

Example 1:
- Region x: bounding box from (1,1) to (2,2)
- Region y: bounding box from (3,3) to (4,4)
- Region z: bounding box from (0,0) to (5,5)

For x SW y:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 3 ✓
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 3 ✓
So, x is SW of y.

For y B z:
- infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(y) = 3 ✓
- supx(y) = 4 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
- infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(y) = 3 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
So, y is B of z.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

For x SW z:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 0 ✗
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(z) = 0 ✗
Not satisfied.

For x S z:
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(z) = 0 ✗
- infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 1 ✓
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
Not satisfied.

For x W z:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 0 ✗
- infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 1 ✓
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
Not satisfied.

For x B z:
- infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 1 ✓
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
- infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 1 ✓
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
So, x is B of z.

In this example, x is B of z.

Example 2:
- Region x: bounding box from (1,1) to (2,2)
- Region y: bounding box from (3,3) to (4,4)
- Region z: bounding box from (0,3) to (5,5)

For x SW y:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 3 ✓
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 3 ✓
So, x is SW of y.

For y B z:
- infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(y) = 3 ✓
- supx(y) = 4 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
- infy(z) = 3 ≤ infy(y) = 3 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
So, y is B of z.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

For x SW z:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 0 ✗
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(z) = 3 ✓
Not satisfied.

For x S z:
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(z) = 3 ✓
- infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 1 ✓
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
So, x is S of z.

For x W z:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 0 ✗
- infy(z) = 3 ≤ infy(x) = 1 ✗
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
Not satisfied.

For x B z:
- infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 1 ✓
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
- infy(z) = 3 ≤ infy(x) = 1 ✗
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
Not satisfied.

In this example, x is S of z.

Example 3:
- Region x: bounding box from (1,1) to (2,2)
- Region y: bounding box from (3,3) to (4,4)
- Region z: bounding box from (3,0) to (5,5)

For x SW y:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 3 ✓
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 3 ✓
So, x is SW of y.

For y B z:
- infx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 3 ✓
- supx(y) = 4 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
- infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(y) = 3 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
So, y is B of z.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

For x SW z:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 3 ✓
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(z) = 0 ✗
Not satisfied.

For x S z:
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(z) = 0 ✗
- infx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(x) = 1 ✗
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
Not satisfied.

For x W z:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 3 ✓
- infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 1 ✓
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
So, x is W of z.

For x B z:
- infx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(x) = 1 ✗
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 5 ✓
- infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 1 ✓
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ✓
Not satisfied.

In this example, x is W of z.

So, through these examples, I've confirmed that, depending on the exact positions of the regions, x can be SW, S, W, or B of z.

Let me check once more to ensure that these are the only possibilities:

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y), so infx(x) < supx(x) ≤ infx(y). We also know that infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y B z). But this doesn't establish an order between supx(z) and infx(x). It's theoretically possible for supx(z) to be less than infx(x), but this would put the right edge of z to the left of the left edge of y, which contradicts the condition that y is B of z, since for y to be inside the bounding box of z, z must extend at least as far right as y. So, x can't be SE of z.

For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). As we've established, x can't be to the right of z (as this contradicts the condition that y is B of z). So, x can't be E of z.

For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). As we've established, x can't be to the right of z. So, x can't be NE of z.

For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y), so supy(x) < infy(y). We also know that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y B z). This doesn't directly establish an order between supy(z) and infy(x). However, for x to be N of z, the bottom edge of x would need to be above the top edge of z. Since y is B of z, the top edge of z is at least as high as the top edge of y, and since x is SW of y, the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of y. This means the top edge of x is below the top edge of z. Therefore, it's not possible for the bottom edge of x to be above the top edge of z. So, x can't be N of z.

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y). Since y is B of z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But for x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Given that supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y B z) and that x is SW of y, it's clear that supy(z) > infy(x), which contradicts the requirement for x to be NW of z. So, x can't be NW of z.

That confirms that the only possible relationships are SW, S, W, and B.

To elaborate, the reason we're getting these four possible answers and not others is because x is constrained to be in the southwest part of the coordinate system (relative to y), and z's bounding box is constrained to contain y's bounding box, but the extent to which z may go beyond y's bounds is not specified. 

If z's box is exactly the same as y's, then x would be SW of z.

If z's box extends further to the left (beyond x) but has the same lower edge as y, then x would be S of z.

If z's box extends further down (beyond x) but has the same left edge as y, then x would be W of z.

If z's box extends both further left and further down (beyond x), then x would be B of z.

These are the only four combinations that respect both constraints: "x SW y" and "y B z". No other relationships are possible.

So, the solution to the problem is that region x can be SW, S, W, or B of region z.

Actually, let me double-check a possibility: can x be SE of z?

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know that y is B of z, so supx(y) ≤ supx(z), and that x is SW of y, so supx(x) ≤ infx(y), which means supx(x) < infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ supx(z). That guarantees supx(x) < supx(z), which means that infx(x) < supx(x) < supx(z), and this contradicts the condition for x to be SE of z, which is supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x can't be SE of z.

Similarly, we can rule out NE, N, NW, and E. So, the only possible relationships are SW, S, W, and B, as we've determined previously.

Given that the relationship between region x and region z could be SW, S, W, or B, these are the possible answers.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is B of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

From x SW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) [x is to the left of y]
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) [x is below y]

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) [z extends at least as far left as y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [z extends at least as far right as y]
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) [z extends at least as far down as y]
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) [z extends at least as far up as y]

Depending on how far z extends beyond y's boundaries, four relationships are possible:

1. SW: If z has similar boundaries to y, x remains southwest of z
2. W: If z extends further down (beyond x) but not far enough left
3. S: If z extends further left (beyond x) but not far enough down
4. B: If z extends both further left and further down (containing x)

The possible relations are: SW, W, S, B
