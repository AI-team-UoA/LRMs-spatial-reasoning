PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this logically, using the definitions of cardinal directions provided.

We're given:
1. x is NE of y, meaning supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y is N of z, meaning supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the relation "x is NE of y", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From the relation "y is N of z", we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

Now, let's try to derive the constraints for x and z:

For the x-coordinate:
From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
From y N z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Combining these, we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x)

Therefore, infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is at least partly to the east of z (or possibly right at the eastern boundary of z). This condition is consistent with x being in the NE, E, or SE direction from z.

For the y-coordinate:
From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y N z, we have supy(z) <= infy(y).

Combining these, we get:
supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x)

Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is at least partly to the north of z (or possibly right at the northern boundary of z). This condition is consistent with x being in the NW, N, or NE direction from z.

Combining the x and y constraints, the possible directions for x relative to z are:
- NE (if x is both to the north and east of z)
- N (if x is directly north of z, meaning its x-coordinates overlap with z)
- E (if x is directly east of z, meaning its y-coordinates overlap with z)

However, we need to be more precise here. Let's think more carefully about the constraints.

Since x is NE of y, the x and y coordinates of x are strictly greater than those of y. Since y is N of z, the y-coordinates of y are strictly greater than those of z, but the x-coordinates of y are contained within the x-range of z.

Given this, let's check the possible directions for x relative to z more carefully:

1. NE: This is possible if x is both to the north and east of z. From the constraints, we know x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)). For x to be to the east of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). We don't have a direct constraint for this, but it's possible depending on the exact positions of the regions.

2. N: This is possible if x is directly north of z, meaning infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z). Given that supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z), it seems that the x-coordinates of x might not overlap with those of z, making N less likely.

3. E: This is possible if x is directly east of z, meaning supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). Given that supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), it seems that the y-coordinates of x might not overlap with those of z, making E less likely.

Let's draw a diagram to get a clearer picture. Since y is N of z, y is above z and could be anywhere within the width of z. Since x is NE of y, x is to the northeast of y.

If y is directly above z (centered), then x would be to the northeast of z.
If y is at the westernmost part of z's northern boundary, x could still be NE of y, and it would be towards the N of z.
If y is at the easternmost part of z's northern boundary, x could be NE of y, and it would be towards the E of z.

Actually, let me try to work with a specific example to understand this better.

Imagine z is a square with coordinates (0,0) to (10,10).
If y is directly above z, it might have coordinates (3,10) to (7,15).
If x is NE of y, it might have coordinates (7,15) to (12,20).

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10
- y: infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 7, infy(y) = 10, supy(y) = 15
- x: infx(x) = 7, supx(x) = 12, infy(x) = 15, supy(x) = 20

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 7: This doesn't satisfy supx(z) <= infx(x), so x is not strictly E of z.
- infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 15, supy(x) = 20: This satisfies supy(z) <= infy(x), so x is strictly N of z.
- Additionally, infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 7, supx(x) = 12: This suggests that x's x-range overlaps with z's x-range, which is consistent with a northward orientation.

So, in this example, x would be N of z, not NE. But this is just one possible configuration.

Let's try another configuration:
Imagine z is a square with coordinates (0,0) to (10,10).
If y is at the easternmost part of z's northern boundary, it might have coordinates (7,10) to (10,15).
If x is NE of y, it might have coordinates (10,15) to (15,20).

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10
- y: infx(y) = 7, supx(y) = 10, infy(y) = 10, supy(y) = 15
- x: infx(x) = 10, supx(x) = 15, infy(x) = 15, supy(x) = 20

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 10: This satisfies supx(z) <= infx(x), meaning x is to the east of z.
- supy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 15: This satisfies supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is to the north of z.

In this configuration, x would be NE of z.

Let's try one more configuration:
Imagine z is a square with coordinates (0,0) to (10,10).
If y is at the westernmost part of z's northern boundary, it might have coordinates (0,10) to (3,15).
If x is NE of y, it might have coordinates (3,15) to (8,20).

With these coordinates:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10
- y: infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 10, supy(y) = 15
- x: infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 8, infy(x) = 15, supy(x) = 20

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 3: This doesn't satisfy supx(z) <= infx(x), so x is not strictly E of z.
- supy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 15: This satisfies supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is to the north of z.
- Additionally, infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 8: This suggests that x's x-range is fully contained within z's x-range, which is consistent with a northward orientation.

In this configuration, x would be N of z.

From these examples, I can see that the possible relations between x and z are N and NE. However, I wonder if there are other possible relations I haven't considered.

Let's think step by step. We have the constraints:
- x is NE of y, meaning supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z, meaning supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

These constraints imply that:
1. x is to the north of y, which is to the north of z. Therefore, x is to the north of z.
2. x is to the east of y, and y's x-range is contained within z's x-range. Depending on the exact positions, x could be to the east of z, or it could overlap with z's easternmost part.

Given these constraints, the possible directions for x relative to z are:
- NE (if x is to the east of z's easternmost boundary)
- N (if x's x-range overlaps with z's x-range, but it's fully to the north of z)

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. Let's reconsider the constraint from y N z. If y is N of z, it means that y's x-range is contained within z's x-range, i.e., infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Given this, let's reconsider the possible positions for x:

1. x is NE of y, so x is to the east of y. Since y's x-range is contained within z's x-range, x can be to the east of z's easternmost boundary (making x NE of z), or x can overlap with z's easternmost part (making x potentially N or NE of z, depending on the extent of overlap).

2. x is also to the north of y, and y is to the north of z. Therefore, x is to the north of z.

So, the potential cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- NE (if x is to the east of z's easternmost boundary)
- N (if x's x-range overlaps with z's x-range but doesn't extend beyond it to the east)

Actually, wait. Let's think about this more precisely. I think I'm rushing the analysis.

We have:
- x is NE of y, which means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z, which means supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Together, these imply:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of z (satisfying the N, NE, and NW directions)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is at least partly to the east of z's left boundary and potentially to the east of z entirely (satisfying the NE, E, and SE directions)

Combining the constraints on x and y coordinates:
- x is to the north of z (N, NE, NW)
- x's leftmost boundary is at least to the right of y's leftmost boundary, which is to the right of z's leftmost boundary (partially constraining x's position from the west)

The combination of these constraints suggests x can be in the following cardinal directions from z:
- NE (if x is both to the north of z and to the east of z's rightmost boundary)
- N (if x is to the north of z and x's x-range overlaps with z's x-range but doesn't extend beyond it to the east or west)
- NW (if x is to the north of z and x's x-range extends to the west of z's leftmost boundary)

However, we have another constraint: supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of y. Since y's x-range is contained within z's x-range (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)), and x is to the east of y's rightmost boundary, x can't be to the west of z's leftmost boundary. This rules out the NW direction.

Now, infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x's leftmost boundary is to the right of y's rightmost boundary, which is within z's x-range. But we don't have a direct constraint that tells us whether x's leftmost boundary is to the right of z's rightmost boundary (which would make x NE of z) or within z's x-range (which would make x N of z).

Let's try to reason from exemplary regions again:

Scenario 1:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10
- y: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 8, infy(y) = 10, supy(y) = 15
- x: infx(x) = 8, supx(x) = 15, infy(x) = 15, supy(x) = 20

In this scenario, x is NE of y, and y is N of z. Checking the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 8: This doesn't meet the condition for x to be strictly to the east of z. However, x does overlap with z's easternmost part.
- supy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 15: This satisfies the condition for x to be strictly to the north of z.

So, in this scenario, x would be N of z.

Scenario 2:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10
- y: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 8, infy(y) = 10, supy(y) = 15
- x: infx(x) = 10, supx(x) = 15, infy(x) = 15, supy(x) = 20

In this scenario, x is NE of y, and y is N of z. Checking the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 10: This satisfies the condition for x to be to the east of z.
- supy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 15: This satisfies the condition for x to be to the north of z.

So, in this scenario, x would be NE of z.

These two examples suggest that x can indeed be either N or NE of z, depending on the exact positions of the regions, and both are consistent with the constraints.

Wait, let's check for more possibilities. We're given:
- x is NE of y, meaning supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z, meaning supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

The constraint supx(y) <= infx(x) says that x's leftmost edge is to the right of y's rightmost edge. And the constraint supx(y) <= supx(z) says that y's rightmost edge is to the left of (or at the same position as) z's rightmost edge.

These constraints allow for two main possibilities:
1. infx(x) > supx(z): x is entirely to the right of z, making x NE of z.
2. infx(x) <= supx(z): x's leftmost edge is to the left of (or at the same position as) z's rightmost edge, allowing for some overlap in the x-dimension.

For the second possibility, let's explore the potential directions:
- If infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x's x-range is fully contained within z's x-range, making x N of z.
- If infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z), then x overlaps with z's easternmost part but also extends to the east, making x have a hybrid direction relative to z. However, I think this would still be classified as N, not NE, since the regions have some overlap in the x-dimension.

Actually, let's check the definition of N again:
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For x to be N of z, we'd need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is satisfied from our given constraints)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (this is satisfied if infx(y) >= infx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), which is part of our given constraints)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (this is not directly derived from our constraints)

If supx(x) > supx(z), which is possible given our constraints, then x would not be strictly N of z. Instead, it would have a composite direction, potentially including NE.

Let's clarify the composite direction. If x's x-range partially overlaps with z's x-range but also extends to the east, then x is neither strictly N nor strictly NE of z. According to the provided context, such a directional relationship would be a combination of single-tile directions, like "N:NE".

However, I was asked to provide the possible relations between region x and region z from among N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B, not composite directions. And from the given constraints, it's clear that x is at least partly to the north of z, rules out S, SE, SW. The fact that x is at least partly to the east of y, and y is within the x-range of z, rules out a strict W or NW relation. x being to the north of z rules out E. And x is not contained within z, so B is out. That leaves only N and NE as possible single-tile directions.

So, in answer to the question, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are N and NE.

Actually, let's take another look. I think the question is asking for all possibile single-tile cardinal direction relations.

From the constraints:
- x is NE of y, meaning supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z, meaning supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

We can infer that:
1. x is to the north of z, i.e., supy(z) <= infy(x). (combining supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)).
2. x is at least partly to the east of the leftmost boundary of z, i.e., infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). 

So, potentially, x can be:
- NE of z (if x is entirely to the east of z)
- N of z (if x's x-range is fully contained within z's x-range)
- NW of z (if x's x-range extends to the west of z's leftmost boundary)
- W of z (if x is entirely to the west of z, which is a simplified reasoning)
- E of z (if x's y-range overlaps with z's y-range and x is to the east of z)

But we have more constraints: x is NE of y, and y is N of z. 

Since y is N of z, y's x-range is contained within z's x-range. And since x is NE of y, x is to the east of y. It's not possible for x to be to the west of z's leftmost boundary, which rules out NW and W.

Given that supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), x is strictly to the north of z, which rules out E.

This leaves the possible relations between region x and region z as N and NE.

Let me double-check this conclusion by taking a step back and consider a specific example where the constraints are met, but x is neither N nor NE of z.

We have:
- x is NE of y, meaning supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z, meaning supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's imagine:
- z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 5
- y: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 8
- x: infx(x) = 7, supx(x) = 12, infy(x) = 9, supy(x) = 12

Checking the constraints:
- supx(y) = 6, infx(x) = 7: This satisfies supx(y) <= infx(x), so x is to the east of y.
- supy(y) = 8, infy(x) = 9: This satisfies supy(y) <= infy(x), so x is to the north of y.
- supy(z) = 5, infy(y) = 5: This satisfies supy(z) <= infy(y), so y is to the north of z.
- infx(z) = 0, infx(y) = 2: This satisfies infx(z) <= infx(y), so y is within the x-range of z.
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 10: This satisfies supx(y) <= supx(z), so y is within the x-range of z.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 7: x is not strictly to the east of z.
- supy(z) = 5, infy(x) = 9: x is strictly to the north of z.

In this example, x's x-range overlaps with z's x-range, so x is neither strictly N (as supx(x) > supx(z) violates the N condition) nor strictly NE (as infx(x) < supx(z) violates the NE condition). According to the conditions I provided, x is a composite direction "N:NE" of z.

Mmm, I'm not sure that reasoning is right. Let's check the definitions from the given context again:

- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

In our example:
- supy(z) = 5, infy(x) = 9: This satisfies supy(z) <= infy(x).
- infx(z) = 0, infx(x) = 7: This satisfies infx(z) <= infx(x).
- supx(x) = 12, supx(z) = 10: This does NOT satisfy supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, x is not strictly N of z in this example because x extends further to the east than z.

The N direction requires that the target region's x-range is fully contained within the reference region's x-range. Similarly, the NE direction requires that the target region is entirely to the northeast of the reference region, meaning it's both to the north and to the east.

Actually, I think my reasoning was right. In that example, x is definitely not N of z because x extends beyond z in the east, as supx(x) > supx(z). And x is not strictly NE of z because there's overlap in the x dimension; we don't have infx(x) > supx(z).

Actually, I think there's another possibility. Rereading the definition of "NE", we have:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

So for x to be NE of z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We already derived that supy(z) <= infy(x) from the given constraints. But supx(z) <= infx(x) is not directly derived from the constraints.

But from the constraints:
- x is NE of y, meaning supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z, meaning supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

We have infx(x) >= supx(y) (from x NE y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z). These don't directly tell us the relation between infx(x) and supx(z). If supx(y) = supx(z), then infx(x) >= supx(z), making x NE of z. But if supx(y) < supx(z), then we don't know for sure, and both N (if x's x-range is contained within z's x-range) and "N:NE" (if x's x-range overlaps with but extends beyond z's x-range to the east) are possible.

Given the constraint that I should choose from {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}, and not from composite directions, let me check if there are direct single-tile relations that apply. 

From the constraints:
1. x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), ruling out S, SE, and SW.
2. x's leftmost boundary is to the right of y's rightmost boundary (supx(y) <= infx(x)), and y's x-range is contained within z's x-range, so x's leftmost boundary is to the right of some point within z's x-range. This means x's x-range can either be fully within z's x-range, overlap with z's easternmost part, or be entirely to the east of z.

If x's x-range is fully within z's x-range and does not extend beyond it, then x is N of z. If x is entirely to the east of z, then x is NE of z. But if there's partial overlap, neither N nor NE strictly applies, and we'd need a composite direction. But composite directions are not in the options I was provided with.

But let me check the definitions again:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

From the constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), so the north condition is met. 

For x to be N of z, we'd also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). From the constraints, we can derive infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), so the first condition infx(z) <= infx(x) is met. But we don't have a constraint on supx(x) relative to supx(z), so the second condition is not guaranteed.

For x to be NE of z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We already know supy(z) <= infy(x). But we don't have a direct constraint ensuring supx(z) <= infx(x).

From the constraints:
- x is NE of y, which implies supx(y) <= infx(x).
- y is N of z, which implies supx(y) <= supx(z).

These two constraints give us supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), but they don't directly give us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x). It could be that supx(z) <= infx(x), in which case x is NE of z, or it could be that supx(z) > infx(x), in which case x is not strictly NE of z.

But let me ask if other directions may be possible:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x to be E of z:
- We'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), which is not guaranteed from the constraints (but is possible, like NE).
- We'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Given that y is to the north of z, and x is to the north of y, x is to the north of z. This implies supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) for x to be E of z. Therefore, x cannot be E of z.

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x to be SE of z:
- We'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), which is not guaranteed from the constraints (but is possible, like NE).
- We'd need supy(x) <= infy(z).

Given that x is to the north of y, and y is to the north of z, x is to the north of z. This implies supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be SE of z. Therefore, x cannot be SE of z.

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For x to be S of z:
- We'd need supy(x) <= infy(z).
- We'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

Given that x is to the north of y, and y is to the north of z, x is to the north of z. This implies supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be S of z. Therefore, x cannot be S of z.

a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x to be SW of z:
- We'd need supx(x) <= infx(z).
- We'd need supy(x) <= infy(z).

Given that y's x-range is within z's x-range, and x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x)), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x to be SW of z.

Also, as we've already established, x is to the north of z, contradicting the condition supy(x) <= infy(z). Therefore, x cannot be SW of z.

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x to be W of z:
- We'd need supx(x) <= infx(z).
- We'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Given that y's x-range is within z's x-range, and x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x)), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x to be W of z.

Also, as we've already established, x is to the north of z, which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This implies that the y-ranges of x and z don't overlap, making it impossible for the conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) to be satisfied simultaneously. Therefore, x cannot be W of z.

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

For x to be NW of z:
- We'd need supx(x) <= infx(z).
- We'd need supy(z) <= infy(x).

Given that y's x-range is within z's x-range, and x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x)), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x to be NW of z. Therefore, x cannot be NW of z.

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x to be B of z:
- We'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- We'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

As we've already established, x is to the north of z, which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This implies that the y-ranges of x and z don't overlap, making it impossible for the conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) to be satisfied simultaneously. Therefore, x cannot be B of z.

Based on the analysis, and given the constraints and the set of possible directions {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}, I conclude that the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are N and NE.

Okay, I think I've been overthinking. Let me review the constraints again, simply and clearly:

We're given:
1. x is NE of y, meaning supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y is N of z, meaning supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, we can infer:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from #2) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from #1) => supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is to the north of z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from #2) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from #1) => infx(z) <= infx(x), meaning x's leftmost boundary is to the right of z's leftmost boundary.

But we want to determine if x can be N or NE or both:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

For x to be N of z:
- We'd need supy(z) <= infy(x), which is established.
- We'd need infx(z) <= infx(x), which is established.
- We'd need supx(x) <= supx(z).

For x to be NE of z:
- We'd need supx(z) <= infx(x).
- We'd need supy(z) <= infy(x), which is established.

From the constraints, we can directly see:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from #1) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from #2).
These don't directly tell us anything about supx(x) relative to supx(z) or infx(x) relative to supx(z).

The lack of a constraint on supx(x) relative to supx(z) means that x could or could not satisfy the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for it to be N of z. And the lack of a constraint on infx(x) relative to supx(z) means that x could or could not satisfy the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for it to be NE of z.

So both N and NE are possible, and which one applies depends on the exact positions of the regions.

Let me see if there are any other directions possible. I've already shown above that directions other than N and NE are ruled out based on the basic constraints we have. So I can confidently say the possible relations are N and NE.

Actually, let me try once more with an illustration:

Scenario 1:
```
    x
y
z
```
y is directly N of z, and x is NE of y. In this scenario, x is NE of z.

Scenario 2:
```
      x
  y
z
```
y is N of z, but shifted to the east within z's width. x is NE of y. In this scenario, x could be N of z if x's width is within z's width, or it could be NE of z if x is to the east of z's rightmost edge.

Scenario 3:
```
  x
y
z
```
y is N of z, but shifted to the west within z's width. x is NE of y. In this scenario, x could be N of z if x's width is within z's width.

From these scenarios, it seems like the possible directions for x relative to z are N and NE. However, given that I was asked to choose among single-tile direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) and not composite ones, the only possible directions from this list are N and NE, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

So to summarize the answer: The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are N and NE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is NE of y: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is N of z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
1. Since supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning x is to the north of z.
2. Since infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning x's leftmost boundary is to the right of z's leftmost boundary.

For x to be N of z:
- We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓
- We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓
- We need supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not guaranteed by constraints)

For x to be NE of z:
- We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not guaranteed by constraints)
- We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓

Depending on the exact positions of the regions, either relation is possible:
- If supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x could be N of z
- If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x could be NE of z

The possible relations are: N, NE
