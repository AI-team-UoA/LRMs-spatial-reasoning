PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that:
1. Region x is SW of region y
2. Region y is SW of region z

Let's think about what these given relations tell us:

If x is SW of y, then:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

If y is SW of z, then:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Now, let's determine what these tell us about the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y SW z)

Combining these: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This means x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z)

Combining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
So: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This means x is to the south of z.

Now, from these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): x is to the west of z
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is to the south of z

These two conditions together define the cardinal direction "SW". So, if x is SW of y and y is SW of z, then x is definitely SW of z.

However, I should double-check if there are any other possible relations. 

Given the constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This is true for SW, W, NW relations.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This is true for SW, S, SE relations.

The only relation that satisfies both constraints is SW. So, x is SW of z.

Wait, let me be more careful. We're dealing with regions here, not just points. I need to check all the single-tile cardinal direction relations to see which ones are possible.

Let's go through each of the 9 cardinal direction relations:

1. B (Bounding Box):
   For x B z, we need:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   But we already know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So, x B z is not possible.

2. S (South):
   For x S z, we need:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   We already know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we also know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So, x S z is not possible.

3. SW (South West):
   For x SW z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   Both these conditions are satisfied.
   So, x SW z is possible.

4. W (West):
   For x W z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   We already know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The second condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   So, x W z is not possible.

5. NW (North West):
   For x NW z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   We already know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The second condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   So, x NW z is not possible.

6. N (North):
   For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   We already know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The conditions supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) both contradict our existing constraints.
   So, x N z is not possible.

7. NE (North East):
   For x NE z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   We already know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Both conditions for NE contradict our existing constraints.
   So, x NE z is not possible.

8. E (East):
   For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   We already know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) both contradict our existing constraints.
   So, x E z is not possible.

9. SE (South East):
   For x SE z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   We already know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   So, x SE z is not possible.

Based on the above analysis, it seems like the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, let me double-check my analysis for W (West). For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). 

The condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and our known constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z) would suggest supy(x) ≤ infy(x), which is not a contradiction for a region, but it means the y-projection of x is bounded above by the infimum of its y-projection, which is unusual. It suggests x might be a degenerate region with a single y-coordinate. Given that we're dealing with regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed unit disk), this doesn't seem right.

Let me rethink this. I'm trying to check if x can be to the West of z.

We know:
- x is SW of y
- y is SW of z

This means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

The constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is satisfied because supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).

For the constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(x):

We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). But this doesn't tell us how infy(x) and infy(z) are related. We can't derive infy(z) ≤ infy(x) or infy(x) ≤ infy(z) from the given constraints.

Similarly, for the constraint supy(x) ≤ supy(z):

We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z). So, supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied.

So, for x to be W of z, we need the additional constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which isn't guaranteed by the given conditions. It's possible, though. Let me try to come up with a concrete example.

Imagine:
- x spans the 2D space: [(0, 0), (1, 1)]
- y spans the 2D space: [(2, 2), (3, 3)]
- z spans the 2D space: [(4, 0), (5, 4)]

For x:
- infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1
- infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1

For y:
- infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3
- infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 3

For z:
- infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 5
- infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 4

With these configurations:
- x is SW of y because supx(x) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(x) = 1 < infy(y) = 2.
- y is SW of z because supx(y) = 3 < infx(z) = 4 and supy(y) = 3 < infy(z) = 4.
- x is SW of z because supx(x) = 1 < infx(z) = 4 and supy(x) = 1 < infy(z) = 4.

But even in this example, x is not W of z because infy(z) = 0 is not less than or equal to infy(x) = 0. They are equal, but the real constraint is that x is to the South of z (because supy(x) = 1 < infy(z) = 0 is not satisfied).

Let me revise the example:
- x spans the 2D space: [(0, 2), (1, 3)]
- y spans the 2D space: [(2, 0), (3, 1)]
- z spans the 2D space: [(4, -1), (5, 1)]

For x:
- infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1
- infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3

For y:
- infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3
- infy(y) = 0, supy(y) = 1

For z:
- infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 5
- infy(z) = -1, supy(z) = 1

With these configurations:
- x is SW of y because supx(x) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(x) = 3 < infy(y) = 0. Wait, supy(x) = 3 >= infy(y) = 0, so x is not S of y, and hence not SW of y.

OK, that's confusing. Let me revise.

x is SW of y means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For example:
- x spans the 2D space: [(0, 0), (1, 1)]
- y spans the 2D space: [(2, 2), (3, 3)]

For x:
- infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1
- infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1

For y:
- infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3
- infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 3

supx(x) = 1 < infx(y) = 2, so x is W of y.
supy(x) = 1 < infy(y) = 2, so x is S of y.
So, x is SW of y.

Now, let's add the condition that y is SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

For example:
- z spans the 2D space: [(4, 4), (5, 5)]

For z:
- infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 5
- infy(z) = 4, supy(z) = 5

supx(y) = 3 < infx(z) = 4, so y is W of z.
supy(y) = 3 < infy(z) = 4, so y is S of z.
So, y is SW of z.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:

supx(x) = 1 < infx(z) = 4, so x is W of z.
supy(x) = 1 < infy(z) = 4, so x is S of z.
So, x is SW of z.

In this example, the only relation between x and z is SW. 

Now, let's see if we can come up with an example where x has a different relation to z.

For W relation, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x is aligned with z vertically)

This would contradict the given constraints.

Let's try for W relation again:
- x spans the 2D space: [(0, 2), (1, 3)]
- y spans the 2D space: [(2, 0), (3, 1)]
- z spans the 2D space: [(4, 1), (5, 4)]

For x:
- infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1
- infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3

For y:
- infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3
- infy(y) = 0, supy(y) = 1

For z:
- infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 5
- infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 4

supx(x) = 1 < infx(y) = 2, so x is W of y.
Wait, for x to be S of y, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but supy(x) = 3 > infy(y) = 0. So, x is not S of y, and hence not SW of y.

Let me revise the example:
- x spans the 2D space: [(0, 0), (1, 1)]
- y spans the 2D space: [(2, 2), (3, 3)]
- z spans the 2D space: [(4, 1), (5, 4)]

With these configurations, x is SW of y, y is SW of z, and x is SW of z.

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

In our example, supx(x) = 1 < infx(z) = 4, so x is to the west of z.
infy(z) = 1 > infy(x) = 0, so z is not entirely to the north or entirely to the south of x.
But since supy(x) = 1 < infy(z) = 1, x is to the south of z.

So, in this example, x is SW of z, not W of z.

Let me try again. We need to find examples where the relation between x and z is something other than SW, if possible.

Let's try for S:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x is horizontally aligned with z)

But we already know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is not horizontally aligned with z. So, S is not possible.

Actually, I'm confused in my own analysis. Let me think more clearly.

Given that region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

If x is SW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

If y is SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
This gives us: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.

Combining the vertical constraints:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
This gives us: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
So, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

Given that x is to the west of z and to the south of z, the only possible cardinal direction relation from the given 9 relations is SW.

So, if region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then region x is SW of region z.

Let me make sure:

For region x to be SW of region z, it should satisfy:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

And we've just shown that both these are true. So, x is SW of z.

The answer is: The possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

Actually, wait a minute. Let me think about this more carefully.

The cardinal direction relations we're looking at are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B. These are the 9 "single-tile" relations, not composed relations. For regions x and z, we want to know which of these single-tile relations can hold.

Given that x is SW of y, and y is SW of z, we've shown that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

For x to have relation SW with z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Which are the constraints we just derived. So, SW is a possible relation between x and z.

Now, let's check if any other relation is possible:

1. B (Bounding Box):
   For x B z, we need:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not satisfied.
   So, B is not a possible relation.

2. S (South):
   For x S z, we need:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not satisfied.
   So, S is not a possible relation.

3. SW (South West):
   For x SW z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   Both these conditions are satisfied.
   So, SW is a possible relation.

4. W (West):
   For x W z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   Since supy(x) ≤ infy(z), the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not satisfied.
   So, W is not a possible relation.

5. NW (North West):
   For x NW z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   Since supy(x) ≤ infy(z), the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not satisfied.
   So, NW is not a possible relation.

6. N (North):
   For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), neither the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) nor the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is satisfied.
   So, N is not a possible relation.

7. NE (North East):
   For x NE z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), neither the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) nor the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is satisfied.
   So, NE is not a possible relation.

8. E (East):
   For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), neither the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) nor the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is satisfied.
   So, E is not a possible relation.

9. SE (South East):
   For x SE z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not satisfied.
   So, SE is not a possible relation.

So, considering the 9 single-tile cardinal direction relations, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

The answer is: The possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

Let me double-check my reasoning:

If x is SW of y and y is SW of z, then:
- From x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

For x to be in relation ρ with z, it must satisfy the conditions of ρ. The only relation that is satisfied is SW:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Therefore, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is SW.

SW is the answer.

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
1. Region x is SW of region y
2. Region y is SW of region z

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These two constraints (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) define exactly the SW relation.
