PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the given information:

1. Region x is B (bounded by) region y, which means:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

2. Region y is SW (southwest) of region z, which means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

I want to determine the possible relationships between region x and region z. Let's analyze the constraints.

From (1), we know that region x is inside the bounding box of region y. From (2), we know that region y is to the southwest of region z.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

First, we know that x is inside y's bounding box, and y is to the southwest of z. This means that x cannot be to the northeast, east, or north of z, since y is to the southwest of z, and x is inside y's bounding box.

Let's consider each cardinal direction:

N (North): Is it possible for x to be North of z?
Since y is SW of z, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z). But from x B y, we have supy(x) ≤ supy(y). So supy(x) ≤ infy(z). However, for x to be North of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Since we don't have any constraint relating supy(z) and infy(x), it's not necessarily true that x is North of z.

Actually, no, let me rethink this. For x to be North of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (derived from above). This would mean infy(x) > supy(x), which is a contradiction. So, x cannot be North of z.

NE (Northeast): Is it possible for x to be Northeast of z?
For x to be Northeast of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). 

But we know that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (since y is SW of z), and infx(x) ≤ supx(y) (since x B y). This means infx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the requirement for Northeast that supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be Northeast of z.

E (East): Is it possible for x to be East of z?
For x to be East of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

But as we've seen from the Northeast analysis, we have infx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the requirement for East. So, x cannot be East of z.

SE (Southeast): Is it possible for x to be Southeast of z?
For x to be Southeast of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

We know that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (since y is SW of z), and infx(x) ≤ supx(y) (since x B y). This means infx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the requirement for Southeast that supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be Southeast of z.

S (South): Is it possible for x to be South of z?
For x to be South of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

We know that supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (since y is SW of z), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (since x B y). This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is one of the requirements for South. 

For the other two conditions: We know that infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (since x B y) but we don't know the relationship between infx(y) and infx(z). Similarly, we know that supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (since x B y) but we don't know the relationship between supx(y) and supx(z).

Actually, let's continue analyzing. We know that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (since y is SW of z). Since infx(z) ≤ supx(z), we have supx(y) ≤ supx(z). From x B y, we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y). So, supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

But, for the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x), we know that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infx(x) ≤ supx(y). This gives us a constraint supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infx(x) ≤ supx(y), or slightly rewritten as infx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). This does not guarantee that infx(z) ≤ infx(x). In fact, if infx(x) < infx(z), then x cannot be South of z. So, the South relationship is not guaranteed.

Actually, let's be even more careful in our analysis. We know that:
1. From x B y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
2. From y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

For the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (required for x S z), we know (1) and (2), but these don't clearly relate infx(z) and infx(x). There's no direct relationship we can infer.

So, x being S of z is a possibility.

SW (Southwest): Is it possible for x to be Southwest of z?
For x to be Southwest of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

We know that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (since y is SW of z), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (since x B y). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which is one of the requirements for Southwest.

We also know that supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (since y is SW of z), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (since x B y). This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is the other requirement for Southwest.

So, x can be Southwest of z.

W (West): Is it possible for x to be West of z?
For x to be West of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

We know that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (since y is SW of z), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (since x B y). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which is one of the requirements for West.

But let's analyze the other conditions. From y SW z, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z), but this doesn't directly relate to infy(x). From x B y, we have infy(y) ≤ infy(x), but this doesn't directly relate to infy(z). So, there's no clear relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).

Similarly, for the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z), we don't have direct relationships to derive this.

So, x being W of z is a possibility.

NW (Northwest): Is it possible for x to be Northwest of z?
For x to be Northwest of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

We know that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (since y is SW of z), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (since x B y). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which is one of the requirements for Northwest.

But for the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we don't have direct relationships to derive this.

So, x being NW of z is a possibility.

B (Bounded by): Is it possible for x to be Bounded by z?
For x to be Bounded by z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

We know that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (since y is SW of z), and infx(x) ≤ supx(y) (since x B y). This gives us infx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). If infx(x) < infx(z), then the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) for B is violated. So, we need additional constraints for x to be B of z.

Actually I realize there is a cleaner approach with diagrams. Let's try to visualize these regions.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y: This means x is inside the bounding box of y.
- Region y is SW of region z: This means y is to the southwest of z.

Geometrically, if y is SW of z, then the farthest northeast point of y is still to the southwest of the closest southwest point of z. In other words, y and z are very clearly separated in the plane.

Now, if x is inside the bounding box of y, then x is confined within the bounds of y. This means that all the points of x are either inside y or at most, at the boundary of y.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relations between x and z?

1. x is SW of z: This is definitely possible since y is SW of z, and x is within the bounds of y. This means the farthest northeast point of x is still to the southwest of the closest southwest point of z.

2. x is W of z: This is possible if x stretches far enough north within y's boundary. However, x cannot extend beyond the west of y. This is a possibility, but not guaranteed.

3. x is S of z: This is possible if x stretches far enough east within y's boundary. However, x cannot extend beyond the south of y. This is a possibility, but not guaranteed.

4. x is NW of z: This is possible if x is positioned such that its entirety is to the northwest of z. But for this, x would need to be positioned at the northern boundary of y. It's a possibility, but not guaranteed.

5. x is B of z: This is not possible. Since y is SW of z, the entirety of y (and hence x) is to the southwest of z. There's no way for x to be within the bounds of z.

6. x is N of z: Not possible. If y is SW of z, then the farthest north point of y is still to the south of the closest south point of z.

7. x is NE of z: Not possible. If y is SW of z, then the farthest northeast point of y is still to the southwest of the closest southwest point of z.

8. x is E of z: Not possible for the same reason as NE.

9. x is SE of z: Not possible for the same reason as NE.

Actually, wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me reconsider:

I think I might have been confused about the cardinal directions. Let's ensure we're using the correct definitions for these directions. 

From the prompt:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) <- this means a is inside b's bounding box.

a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b) <- this means a is completely to the southwest of b, with no overlap.

Let's use the following notation for our regions:
- Region x (bounding box defined by the points infx(x), supx(x), infy(x), supy(x))
- Region y (bounding box defined by the points infx(y), supx(y), infy(y), supy(y))
- Region z (bounding box defined by the points infx(z), supx(z), infy(z), supy(z))

Given:
1. Region x is B of region y, which means:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

2. Region y is SW of region z, which means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's derive the constraints on region x's bounding box based on the given conditions.

From (1), we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

And from (2), we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

By transitive property, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) -> supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) -> supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's check the constraints for each possible relation between x and z:

S (South): For x to be South of z, we need:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied from derived constraints)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not necessarily satisfied)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not necessarily satisfied)

SW (Southwest): For x to be Southwest of z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied from derived constraints)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied from derived constraints)

W (West): For x to be West of z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied from derived constraints)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily satisfied)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not necessarily satisfied)

NW (Northwest): For x to be Northwest of z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied from derived constraints)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily satisfied)

N (North): For x to be North of z, we need:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily satisfied)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not necessarily satisfied)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not necessarily satisfied)

NE (Northeast): For x to be Northeast of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) by definition)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily satisfied)

E (East): For x to be East of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) by definition)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily satisfied)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not necessarily satisfied)

SE (Southeast): For x to be Southeast of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) by definition)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied from derived constraints)

B (Bounded by): For x to be Bounded by z, we need:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not necessarily satisfied)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not necessarily satisfied)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily satisfied)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not necessarily satisfied)

Based on the derived constraints, the only relation that's guaranteed is SW (Southwest) because both required constraints (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) are satisfied.

For S, W, NW, there are some constraints that are satisfied, but others that aren't derived directly from the given conditions. So these are possible, but not guaranteed.

For N, NE, E, SE, B, there are constraints that either contradict our derived constraints or are not necessarily satisfied based on the given conditions.

So the possible relations between region x and region z include:
- SW (Southwest)
- S (South)
- W (West)
- NW (Northwest)
- B (Bounded by) <- But this should actually be impossible if I think about the logic correctly, even though I initially listed it.

Actually I realize I'm getting confused going back and forth. Let's try with a cleaner approach. 

We have:
1. Region x is B of region y, meaning x is inside the bounding box of y.
2. Region y is SW of region z, meaning y is completely to the southwest of z, with no overlap.

Based on (1), x is inside the bounding box of y, so it's entirely confined within the rectangle defined by y's extreme points.

Based on (2), y is completely to the southwest of z, so the entire bounding box of y is to the southwest of z.

Combining (1) and (2), since x is entirely within y's bounding box, and y's bounding box is entirely to the southwest of z, it follows that x is also entirely to the southwest of z.

However, this is the most general constraint. Let's think of specific configurations:

Since x is inside the bounding box of y, depending on its exact placement, x could potentially have other relations with z.

Let's draw it out: 

1. Imagine a rectangular region that represents the bounding box of y.
2. Place y inside this rectangle, but it doesn't necessarily occupy the entire rectangle.
3. Now, place z such that the entire bounding box of y is to the southwest of z.
4. Depending on the exact shape and position of y within its bounding box, there may be parts of the bounding box that are not occupied by y.
5. If x is placed in these parts, it can be inside the bounding box of y (following constraint 1), but it doesn't necessarily have a strict SW relationship with z.

But wait, that doesn't sound right. If x is inside the bounding box of y, it means x is entirely confined within the rectangular region defined by y's extreme points. It doesn't necessarily mean x is inside y itself.

But if y is SW of z and x is inside the bounding box of y, then x is also SW of z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is SW.

Hmm, but what if x is positioned at the upper right corner of y's bounding box, and if z is positioned such that it's almost touching y? In such a case, x might be to the west of z (not southwest), or maybe to the south, or even northwest.

Let's try to understand the constraints more carefully. From the constraints we've established:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Given these two strict constraints, x does indeed have a strict SW relationship with z. This means the highest and rightmost point of x is still to the southwest of the lowest and leftmost point of z.

But I'm still conflating the relations of the regions with the bounding boxes as defined in the problem, which has caused some confusion. Let me restructure my approach to ensure clarity.

From the problem formulation, we have:
1. Region x is B of region y, which means:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

2. Region y is SW of region z, which means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, as I derived earlier, I get:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) -> supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) -> supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These constraints tell me that the maximum x-coordinate of region x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of region z, and the maximum y-coordinate of region x is less than the minimum y-coordinate of region z. This, by definition, means region x is to the southwest of region z, or in other words, x SW z.

Ok, wait, no. I'm forgetting that regions may have more complex relations.

Let me reassess the situation:

1. Region x is B of region y, which means x is inside the bounding box of y.
2. Region y is SW of region z, which means the entirety of y is to the southwest of z.

Given these, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

If x is inside the bounding box of y, its exact relation with z would depend on the specifics of how x is positioned within the bounding box of y. 

To be SW of z, x must be entirely to the southwest of z, which means the farthest northeast point of x is still to the southwest of the closest southwest point of z. From our derived constraints (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), x is indeed SW of z. This is the only guaranteed relation given the constraints and seems to make the most sense..

OK I was overthinking this. Let's one more time summarize the constraints:

Given:
1. Region x is B of region y, which means x is inside the bounding box of y.
2. Region y is SW of region z, which means the entirety of y is to the southwest of z.

From these, we derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These constraints tell us that region x is to the southwest of region z, i.e., x SW z.

So, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: SW.

But wait actually, given our definition of cardinal directions, the way they're derived solely from the bounding boxes means that the cardinal direction doesn't constraint the actual interiors of the regions. This means I need to look at it in a more general way.

Let's think of it from a set-theoretic perspective:

1. Region x is B of region y.
2. Region y is SW of region z.

And we want to know the possible relations between x and z.

The SW relation, as defined in the problem, only tells us that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

But this doesn't constrain the actual interior of y; it only tells us about the bounds of y. Similarly, the B relation only tells us the relation between the bounds of x and y.

So, while we've derived that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) , which seems to suggest the only possible relation is x SW z.

Actually, let's use a slightly different approach. Let's think of the problem in terms of two-dimensional space. In this space, we denote the 9 possible single-tile cardinal direction relations using the familiar cardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B.

If we have a reference region z, then the above 9 tiles divide the 2D space into 9 regions. 

Given that y is SW of z, it means y is entirely within the SW tile defined by z. 

Given that x is B of y, it means x is within the B tile defined by y.

Now, if we consider all possible positions of y (within the SW tile of z) and all possible positions of x (within the B tile of y), what are the possible tiles of z that x can lie in?

Since y is entirely within the SW tile of z, the B tile of y is also entirely within the SW tile of z. Since x is within the B tile of y, it follows that x is also entirely within the SW tile of z. 

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is: SW.

Ok, let me be even more straightforward. Given the constraints:
1. Region x is B of region y, which means:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

2. Region y is SW of region z, which means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

I've already established that these lead to:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Now, considering the definition of each cardinal direction, as mentioned in the problem, we have:

1. S (South): supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a), and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
   For x to be South of z, we need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied from derived constraints), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not necessarily satisfied), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not necessarily satisfied)

2. SW (Southwest): supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
   For x to be Southwest of z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied from derived constraints) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied from derived constraints)

3. W (West): supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
   For x to be West of z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied from derived constraints), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily satisfied), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not necessarily satisfied)

So actually it does seem like only SW is guaranteed, and it's possible that x is SW of z, S of z, W of z, or some combination of those three tiles? No, not quite. Let's think about it more.

x is B of y means x is inside the bounding box of y. y is SW of z, which means the entirety of y is to the southwest of z. Therefore, the entirety of the bounding box of y is also to the southwest of z.

Since x is inside the bounding box of y, and the entirety of the bounding box of y is to the southwest of z, it follows that x is also entirely to the southwest of z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is x SW z.

But let me just double check. 

Actually, let's explicitly test a case to convince myself of the above. I sketched a configuration where:
1. Region y is SW of region z.
2. Region x is B of region y, but positioned such that it's at the upper right corner of y's bounding box.

From the constraints, I know that:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

This gives us:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) -> supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) -> supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These two derived constraints are the exact conditions for the SW relation. So, based on this specific test, x is SW of z.

However, I was considering if there's a position of x within the bounding box of y that could result in a different relation with z. Given the constraints, I can't find such a position because as long as x is within the bounding box of y, it's constrained to an SW relation with z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is x SW z.

Wait, I just realized that the Cardinal directions, as defined in our problem, refer to spaces that have clear boundaries. Each of these tiles is the outcome of a planar partition, and regions are placed in the resulting tiles. The cardinal directions can be multi-tile, allowing regions to span across multiple tiles.

Let's reinterpret the problem in this light. The relation "y is SW of z" means y is entirely within the SW tile defined by z. The relation "x is B of y" means x is entirely within the B tile defined by y.

From our understanding of these cardinal directions, the SW tile of z is distinct from the B tile of y. If x is entirely within the B tile of y, then x cannot be in any other tile defined by y. Specifically, x cannot be to the north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, or northwest of y.

But since y lies on the southwest quadrant relative to z, we know that the whole region y is below the horizontal line passing through the southernmost point of z and to the left of the vertical line passing through the westernmost point of z.

So, x, which is inside y's bounding box that is somewhere in the southwest quadrant relative to z, will also be below the horizontal line passing through the southernmost point of z and to the left of the vertical line passing through the westernmost point of z. This means x lies in the same southwest quadrant relative to z, and thus x is also SW of z.

Ah, but actually the descriptions I've been using don't correspond to the formal definitions provided in the problem. In the problem, each cardinal direction is defined in terms of the infima and suprema of the projections of the regions on the x and y axes.

Let me revisit the precise definitions:

x B y if and only if (infx(y) ≤ infx(x)) and (supx(x) ≤ supx(y)) and (infy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and (supy(x) ≤ supy(y))

x SW y if and only if (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and (supy(x) ≤ infy(y))

Given:
1. Region x is B of region y, which means x is inside the bounding box of y.
2. Region y is SW of region z, which means, by definition, supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Using the transitive property, I've derived:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) -> supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) -> supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These derived constraints are the exact conditions for the SW relation between x and z. This confirms that, based on the given constraints, the relation between x and z is SW.

But wait, I'm still thinking about this, and I want to be absolutely sure. The conditions I've derived, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the SW relation according to the definition in the problem.

But I'm wondering if there's something I've overlooked. Let's visualize the bounding boxes clearly:

1. The bounding box of y is given by the rectangle defined by the points (infx(y), infy(y)) and (supx(y), supy(y)).
2. The bounding box of z is given by the rectangle defined by the points (infx(z), infy(z)) and (supx(z), supy(z)).

From the relation y SW z, I know that the bounding box of y is completely to the southwest of the bounding box of z, with no overlap. This means there's a clear separation between the two rectangles.

From the relation x B y, I know that the bounding box of x is completely inside the bounding box of y.

Given these constraints, it's clear that the bounding box of x is also completely to the southwest of the bounding box of z, with no overlap. This implies the SW relation between x and z.

So, I'm confident now: the relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, but I realize now I'm missing something. Let me clarify whether the relation is always SW, or if it could be a multi-tile relation involving SW. This is quite critical since the problem says to find the POSSIBLE relations.

If we look at the single-tile directions, our derived constraints clearly establish the SW relation. But what if we consider multi-tile directions? Do our derived constraints preclude other single-tile direction besides SW?

According to the problem formulation, a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE} and Ri <> Rj for all i <> j. If a region a is simultaneously in two different single-tile cardinal directions with respect to b, then a has a multi-tile cardinal direction relation with respect to b such as "a S:SW b" meaning that a is partially in the S tile and partially in the SW tile.

If I want to check if a region a is in the S tile with respect to region b, I'd check if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a), and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

For the SW tile, I'd check if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).

I've already derived that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which are the defining conditions for the SW relation. The position of region x is such that it's entirely within the SW tile defined by z, so it doesn't stray into other tiles.

Ok, when I'm assessing a multi-tile relation, I know that the region occupies at least a part of each tile.

Given the constraints I've derived:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These are the exact conditions for the SW relation. This suggests that region x is at least partially within the SW tile defined by z.

For x to (again, at least partially) be in the S tile with respect to z, I'd need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied from derived constraints)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not established from the constraints)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not established from the constraints)

For x to be in the W tile with respect to z, I'd need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied from derived constraints)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not established from the constraints)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not established from the constraints)

For x to be in any other single-tile cardinal direction with respect to z, I'd need to satisfy the corresponding conditions. However, our derived constraints only guarantee that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which align exclusively with the SW relation.

I'm not seeing how, given these constraints, x could occupy tiles other than the SW tile defined by z. If x were to occupy multiple tiles, then some part of x would have to fall outside the SW tile, which would violate our derived constraints.

So, I'm concluded that, based on the given constraints, the relation between x and z is SW, and is limited to solely this tile.

Let me double-check by revisiting the specific definitions of the cardinal directions:

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
a E b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)

I've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). These align with the conditions for the SW relation. However, these don't align with the conditions for S, W, or any other cardinal direction.

For, for x to be in a multi-tile relation with z like "x SW:W z," it would have to occupy both the SW and the W tiles, which is incompatible with the relations between x, y, and z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

Alright, after considerable thought and analysis, I'm confident that the correct answer is:

The only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

Wait, I realize I've been fixating on single-direction tiles and forgetting that regions can span multiple directions, especially given that regions in the problem are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk.

Ugh, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me go back to basic logic:

1. Region x is B of region y. This means x is inside the bounding box of y, but not necessarily inside the actual region y (a common confusion I was falling into).
2. Region y is SW of region z. This means the entirety of y is to the southwest of z.

Let's see how the bounds of region x, y, and z relate to each other. If we refer back to the original constraints:

x B y means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

y SW z means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Transitively:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) -> supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) -> supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These derived constraints (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) are the conditions for the SW relation. This means region x is to the southwest of region z, similar to how region y is.

But let's take a step back. An important distinction might be missing. Is being a southwest of a region as defined in the original problem?

I feel like I got confused with multi-title cardinal relations. Let's clarify:

A cardinal direction relation is R1: ... : Rk, where R1, R2, R3, ... Rk are different elements from {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. This implies that a region can span multiple directions (or tiles) with respect to another region.

Let me reassess the situation. Regions x, y and z are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. Initially, I had established the bounds relationship based on their bounding boxes.

So, if region a has a relation R1: ... : Rk with region b, it means a spans across tiles R1, .., Rk, with respect to b.

In our case, I've established that region x satisfies the conditions for being in the SW tile with respect to region z (using our derived constraints). But could it ALSO be in any other tile?

Let me check the combinations. To be in multiple tiles, region x would need to stray into other tiles.

For x to be in the S tile with respect to z, in addition to the SW tile, I'd need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (already established)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not generally true, but possible)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not necessarily true, but possible)

The key question here is if the relationship between x and y can be such that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Given the current constraints, this isn't necessary, but it's not ruled out either.

Similarly, for x to be in the W tile with respect to z, in addition to the SW tile, I'd need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (already established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily true, but possible)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not necessarily true, but possible)

For both of these cases, while some of the conditions are established, others aren't. But they're also not ruled out. So, it's possible for x to have a multi-tilem cardinal relation with z, where the relation could be SW, or it could be SW:S, or SW:W, or even SW:S:W.

Let's say we have a specific configuration where:
- y is exactly at a single point in the southwest corner of a notional bounding box, and that's z's southwest corner.
- x is inside y's bounding box, but actually at the north and east boundaries of that bounding box.

In such a configuration, x is (just barely) inside y's bounding box, but also, visually, almost directly south of z and west of z, not only southwest. In this case, our conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) would be true, but it's also plausible that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Well, wait. Let me think this through a different angle again. If region x is inside the bounding box of region y, and y is to the southwest of z, then could x ever be to the east of z?

Clearly x shouldn't be on the east of z, since the easternmost point of x (i.e., supx(x)) is bounded by the easternmost point of y (i.e., supx(y)), and the entire y is to the west of z.

Similarly, x can't be to the north of z, since the northernmost point of x (i.e., supy(x)) is bounded by the northernmost point of y (i.e., supy(y)), and the entire y is to the south of z.

But when I think about the cases where x is south of z or west of z, things get a bit murkier. This is because, depending on the specifics of region x, y, and z, there might be points in x that align with z in the x-direction (south) or y-direction (west).

Actually, let me look at the conditions for region x to be solely to the South, solely to the West or solely to the Southwest of region z.

For x to be solely to the south of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (already established)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not necessarily true)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not necessarily true)

The conditions infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) imply that, in the x-direction, region x is contained within the bounds of region z. 

For x to be solely to the west of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (already established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily true)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not necessarily true)

The conditions infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) imply that, in the y-direction, region x is contained within the bounds of region z.

For x to be solely to the southwest of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (already established)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (already established)

Given the constraints, the only guaranteed relation is SW since the conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) are the only ones we can firmly establish.

So I think my initial finding is correct: if x B y and y SW z, then the only mandatory relation between x and z is SW.

Hold up, I'm not convinced. Let's be very careful here. I'm considering a scenario where:
- Region y is at a single point: (0, 0).
- Region z is at a single point: (1, 1).
- y SW z is true: since supx(y) = 0 ≤ infx(z) = 1 and supy(y) = 0 ≤ infy(z) = 1.
- The bounding box of y is [0, 0] x [0, 0].
- x B y means x is inside the bounding box of y, which means x is also at the same single point: (0, 0).
- So, x SW z.

But what if we consider another scenario:
- Region y is on a straight line, starting from (0, 0) and up to (0.5, 0.5).
- Region z is at a single point: (1, 1).
- The bounding box of y is [0, 0.5] x [0, 0.5].
- y SW z is true: since supx(y) = 0.5 ≤ infx(z) = 1 and supy(y) = 0.5 ≤ infy(z) = 1.
- Now, x can be anywhere inside the bounding box of y.
  - If x is at (0, 0), then x SW z.
  - If x is at (0.5, 0), then x is both SW and S of z.
  - If x is at (0, 0.5), then x is both SW and W of z.
  - If x occupies the entire bounding box, then x is SW:S:W of z.

Actually, let me check once more to verify if my conditions for multi-tile relationships are accurate. For relations, they need to satisvy the formalized definitions of cardinal directions, not just (non)overlaps of bounding boxes.

Let's revisit the SW relation definition:
a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

This says directly that the farthest right point of a is still to the left of the leftmost point of b, and the highest point of a is still below the lowest point of b.

Let's visualize it:
a is below the horizontal line passing through infy(b) and to the left of the vertical line passing through infx(b).

Now, if I consider the possibility of a S:SW b (i.e. whether a being in both S and SW tiles with respect to b), then a would need to satisfy the conditions for S while also satisfying the conditions for SW. Let's check the OR across single-tile and multi-tile:

For a to be (at least partly) in the S tile with respect to b, I'd need:
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (already established)
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a) (for at least a part of a)
- supx(a) ≤ supx(b) (for at least a part of a)

If x B y and y SW z, then we've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This places x in the SW tile with respect to z.

OK, let's look at the formal definition of multi-tile with respect to the single-tile cardinal directions. We know that if a is entirely in the S tile with respect to b, then by the definition, all of a has to be:
- Below b (supy(a) ≤ infy(b))
- Overlapping b in the x-direction (infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b))

Similarly, if a is entirely in the SW tile with respect to b, then by the definition, all of a has to be:
- Below b (supy(a) ≤ infy(b))
- To the left of b (supx(a) ≤ infx(b))

If a lies in both the S and SW tiles with respect to b, then some part of a (not necessarily the entirety of a) is in the S tile and some part (again, not necessarily the entirety) is in the SW tile. For multi-tile, the definitions are more complex, but the general idea is to check if the region spans multiple areas.

OK, the precise definition I need to use is: a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where R1, .., Rk are different elements from {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

For a region a to have a relation R1: ... : Rk with region b, there are regions a1, ..., ak such that for that a_i has relation R_i with b, and the union of a_1, ..., a_k is a closed, connected region a. This implies that region a can span multiple tiles (or areas) with respect to region b.

So, a multi-tile direction relation like "a S:SW b" would mean a covers both the South and Southwest tiles in relation to b, and possibly other tiles.

Upon reviewing the constraints, I'm confident that the relation between x and z is SW.

SW is the only direction that's guaranteed. Let's go through the reasons for each of the other possibilities:

NE, E, SE: These are ruled out because x is inside the bounding box of y, which is to the SW of z.

N, NW: These are ruled out because y is to the south of z (part of the SW relation), which means x is also to the south of z.

B: This is ruled out because the bounding box of y is outside the bounding box of z (since y SW z), and x is inside the bounding box of y.

S (South): For x to be fully contained within the S tile with respect to z, it needs to satisfy: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which is true) and (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)). But given that y is to the left of z (i.e., supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), and x is inside the bounding box of y, it's not necessarily true that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, the S relation isn't guaranteed.

W (West): Similar to the S relation, for x to be fully contained within the W tile with respect to z, it needs to satisfy: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is true) and (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)). Again, it's not necessarily true that infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) given the constraints. So, the W relation isn't guaranteed either.

Is it possible for x to lie in both the S and SW tiles? For this to happen, x would need to have parts that satisfy both the S and SW relations with respect to z. However, the S relation requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), while the SW relation requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z). These conditions are incompatible, so x can't lie in both the S and SW tiles.

Is it possible for x to lie in both the W and SW tiles? For this to happen, the W relation requires infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), while the SW relation requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z). These conditions are incompatible, so x can't lie in both the W and SW tiles (at least given the provided definitions of these relations).

So, I'm confident that the relation between x and z is only SW.

Hmm, let me re-read the information for South, Southwest, and West to ensure I'm not missing anything:

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)

OK I'm going to be extremely careful here. It's a subtle point. Any region a's relationship with region b is based on the specific position of region a with respect to region b. These positions are categorized using the cardinal direction tiles.

For region a to be solely in the South tile with respect to region b, it means that region a is entirely below region b but aligns with it (at least partially) in the x-direction.

For region a to be solely in the Southwest tile with respect to region b, it means that region a is entirely below and to the left of region b.

For region a to be solely in the West tile with respect to region b, it means that region a is entirely to the left of region b but aligns with it (at least partially) in the y-direction.

Given our constraints:
- x is inside the bounding box of y (from x B y)
- y is to the southwest of z (from y SW z)

I've derived that x is to the southwest of z (since the conditions for the SW relation are satisfied). But I'm questioning if there's a possibility for x to be in other tiles as well.

The definition of the cardinal tiles does introduce a property of mutual exclusivity. A point can't be in both the South and Southwest tiles simultaneously, and it also can't be in both the West and Southwest tiles simultaneously. This is because the conditions of one would contradict the conditions of the other (similarly to the reasoning I provided earlier). And to the point, regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which means regions are connected (cannot have multiple disconnected parts). This means a region is in one or multiple cardinal directions, not in multiple cardinal directions.

Sorry, I need to be more precise: A region can be in multiple single-digit cardinal directions. But a region can't simultaneously be in the South and Southwest tiles for a single point, because of the contradicting conditions.

But let's get back to our problem. I think the clearest way to answer this question is by process of elimination. Let's think about what's preventing the second area (x) from occupying tiles:

For South (S):
- To be fully in the South tile, x needs: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- Since x is inside the bounding box of y, and y is to the southwest of z, the conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) are satisfied.
- This implies that for x to be in the South tile, it needs: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But we also have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) from the previous deduction, which would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is a contradiction since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) by definition.

So, x cannot be in the South tile.

For West (W):
- To be fully in the West tile, x needs: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- Similarly, since x is inside the bounding box of y, and y is to the southwest of z, the conditions: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) are satisfied.
- For x to be in the West tile, it needs: infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But we also have supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from the previous deduction, which would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is a contradiction since infy(x) ≤ supy(x) by definition.

So, x cannot be in the West tile eiither.

For the NW, N, NE, E, SE, and B tiles, it's straightforward to see that x cannot be in these tiles due to the bounds established.

So, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

OK, so let's conclude:

Just to make it more clear about why I've been going in circles, the answer requires combining two things:

1. Constraints of the regions' positions
2. The formal definitions of the single-tile cardinal directions

For a region a to be in a cardinal direction (let's say South) with respect to region b, it means a must be located such that it's entirely below b but some points in it must align with b in the x-direction, and other conditions.

The constraints of this problem are:
1. Region x B y: x is bounded by y.
2. Region y SW z: y is southwest of z.

From these, we've derived that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which establish an SW relation between x and z.

Now, for x to have a multi-tile relation, it would need to stray into other tiles. But the constraints we've established are too strict; they restrict x to only the SW tile. It cannot stray into other tiles (such as S, W, etc.) because doing so would contradict the constraints we've established.

Given the formulation of the problem, and our understanding of the cardinal direction relations, I'm confident that the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

Done, so my final answer is:

IF region x is B of region y, and region y is SW of region z, THEN the relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, let me triple check with a specific diagram just to convince myself again.

Imagine:
- Region z is a square region positioned top-right from (3,3) to (4,4).
- Region y is a square region positioned bottom-left from (1,1) to (2,2).
  (this ensures y SW z, since supx(y) = 2 < infx(z) = 3 and supy(y) = 2 < infy(z) = 3)
- Region x is a square region positioned inside the bounding box of y, e.g. from (1.2, 1.2) to (1.8, 1.8).
  (this ensures x B y, since infx(y) = 1 < infx(x) = 1.2 and supx(x) = 1.8 < supx(y) = 2, etc.)

Now, with these positions:
supx(x) = 1.8 < infx(z) = 3 and supy(x) = 1.8 < infy(z) = 3

This confirms the SW relation between x and z.

For x to be in the S tile with respect to z, it would need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
But here, infx(z) = 3 > infx(x) = 1.2, which contradicts the requirement for S.

For x to be in the W tile with respect to z, it would need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
But here, infy(z) = 3 > infy(x) = 1.2, which contradicts the requirement for W.

This further confirms that the only relation between x and z is SW.

Alright, I'm definitely convinced: The only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction definitions, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given information:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

By combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) → supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) → supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These derived conditions (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) precisely match the definition of the SW relation.
