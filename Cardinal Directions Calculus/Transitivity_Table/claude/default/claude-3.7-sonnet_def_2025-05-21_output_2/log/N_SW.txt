PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's figure out the possible relations between regions x and z, given that:
- x N y: Region x is North of region y
- y SW z: Region y is Southwest of region z

I'll analyze this step by step using the definitions provided:

For x N y, this means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection)

For y SW z, this means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, I need to determine what these constraints tell us about the possible relations between x and z.

Given that:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

This means both x and z are above y, but we can't determine which one is higher.

Also:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y SW z)

This means x is above and within the x-projection of y, while z is to the right of y. 

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

This implies that x is completely to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)).

So far, we know that x is to the left of z. But we need to determine their vertical relationship.

Let's consider the possibilities:
1. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is above z, making the relation x NW z.
2. If infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(z), then x and z overlap vertically, making the relation x W z.
3. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is below z, making the relation x SW z.

These are the possible relations between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, let me double-check my logic. 

We have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can't determine the exact vertical relationship between x and z. Both are above y, but their relative positions to each other are undetermined.

And:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)

From these, we know supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

So, the possible cardinal directions from x to z are:
- NW (if x is above z)
- W (if x overlaps vertically with z)
- SW (if x is below z)

Let me verify once more to ensure I haven't missed anything.

Actually, let's double-check using a visual diagram. I'll place y at the origin for simplicity:

For x N y:
- x is directly above y (within y's x-projection)
- So x is somewhere in a horizontal band directly above y

For y SW z:
- y is to the southwest of z
- z is to the northeast of y

Given these positions, if we want to determine where x is relative to z:
- x is above y
- z is to the northeast of y

So x is above y and z is to the northeast of y. This means x could be:
- Northwest of z (if x is far enough to the left and above z)
- West of z (if x is directly to the left of z)
- Southwest of z (if x is to the left and below z)
- North of z (if x is directly above z)
- B (if x is inside the bounding box of z)
- Northwest of z (if x overlaps with z in a specific way)

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's simplify.

Given:
- x N y: x is directly above y (within y's x-projection)
- y SW z: y is to the southwest of z

This means:
- x is above y and within y's x-projection
- z is to the northeast of y

Visually:
- y is at the origin
- x is above y (in the North)
- z is to the northeast of y

Since x is directly above y and z is to the northeast of y, x can be:
- Northwest of z (if x is far left and high)
- North of z (if x is directly above z)
- Northeast of z (if x is far right and high)
- West of z (if x is directly to the left of z)
- B (if x is inside z's bounding box)

Hmm, it's still not clear. Let me revisit the original constraints and ensure I'm interpreting them correctly.

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's)

For y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From x N y and y SW z, we can deduce:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

This means both x and z are above y, but we can't determine their relative vertical positions.

Also:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y SW z)

This gives us supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Ok, so x is to the left of z, and both x and z are above y. Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. NW: If x is to the left of z and above z.
2. W: If x is to the left of z and overlaps vertically with z.
3. SW: If x is to the left of z and below z.

Let's reconsider this situation more carefully. I think I'm making a mistake. 

Let's go back to the constraints:

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's)

For y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

We already established that x is to the left of z because supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).

Now, let's determine the vertical relationship between x and z.

From x N y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above y.
From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z), which means z is above y.

But we don't have a direct constraint relating the vertical positions of x and z. They could be at the same height, or one could be above the other.

Ok actually, y is southwest of z. That means: 
- y is to the left and below z.

So far, we have:
- x is north of y, meaning x is directly above y (within y's x-projection)
- y is southwest of z, meaning y is to the left and below z
- This gives us that x is to the left of z (because x's x-projection is within y's, and y is to the left of z)

Let's analyze the vertical relationship:
- x is above y
- y is below z
- But we don't have a direct relationship between the vertical positions of x and z

Hmm, actually, since x is directly above y (it's in the "N" direction, which means within y's x-projection), and y is to the southwest of z, it's possible for x to be to the left and at any vertical position relative to z (above, at the same height, or below).

Let me check if x can overlap with z vertically. If this is the case, then x can be to the west of z. Otherwise, it can only be NW or SW.

From x N y, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

We've already established that x is to the left of z. Now, for the vertical relationship, can x overlap with z vertically?

We know:
- infy(x) >= supy(y) (from x N y)
- infy(z) >= supy(y) (from y SW z)

This means both x and z have their lower bounds above the upper bound of y. However, this doesn't give us a direct relationship between the vertical positions of x and z.

The constraints telling us that x is above y and z is above y are not sufficient to rule out any vertical relationship between x and z. Thus, x could be:
- Above z
- At the same height as z
- Below z

Combined with the horizontal constraint that x is to the left of z, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are:
- NW (if x is to the left and above z)
- W (if x is to the left and at the same height as z)
- SW (if x is to the left and below z)

Let me reason about this more carefully.

x N y means x is north of y. So, the y-coordinates of region x are all greater than the y-coordinates of region y. Also, the x-coordinates of region x are within the range of x-coordinates of region y.

y SW z means y is southwest of z. So, the x-coordinates of region y are all less than the x-coordinates of region z, and the y-coordinates of region y are all less than the y-coordinates of region z.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between regions x and z.

Using a new approach, let me consider specific points within these regions:

For any point (x_i, y_i) in region x, we know from x N y that:
- y_i > y_j for any point (x_j, y_j) in region y
- x_j_min ≤ x_i ≤ x_j_max, where x_j_min and x_j_max are the minimum and maximum x-coordinates in region y

For any point (y_j, y_j) in region y, we know from y SW z that:
- y_j < z_k for any point (z_k, z_k) in region z
- x_j < z_k for any point (z_k, z_k) in region z

From these, we can derive that for any point (x_i, y_i) in region x and any point (z_k, z_k) in region z:
- x_i ≤ x_j_max < z_k (so x_i < z_k)

This confirms that region x is to the left of region z (because all points in x have smaller x-coordinates than all points in z).

But for the y-coordinates:
- y_i > y_j and y_j < z_k

We can only derive that y_i > y_j and y_j < z_k, but we can't determine the relationship between y_i and z_k. They could be in any order.

So, considering all possibilities for the vertical relationship, region x could be:
- Northwest of region z (if all points in x have greater y-coordinates than all points in z)
- West of region z (if the y-coordinates of x and z overlap)
- Southwest of region z (if all points in x have smaller y-coordinates than all points in z)

Let's double-check this with a specific example:

Imagine:
- Region y is at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- Region x is at (0, 2) with width and height of 1.
- Region z is at (2, 1) with width and height of 1.

In this case:
- x N y? Yes, because x is directly above y.
- y SW z? Yes, because y is to the left and below z.
- Relation between x and z? x is Northwest of z.

What about another example?

Imagine:
- Region y is at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- Region x is at (0, 2) with width and height of 1.
- Region z is at (2, 3) with width and height of 1.

In this case:
- x N y? Yes, because x is directly above y.
- y SW z? Yes, because y is to the left and below z.
- Relation between x and z? x is West of z.

And one more:

Imagine:
- Region y is at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- Region x is at (0, 2) with width and height of 1.
- Region z is at (2, 4) with width and height of 1.

In this case:
- x N y? Yes, because x is directly above y.
- y SW z? Yes, because y is to the left and below z.
- Relation between x and z? x is Southwest of z.

These examples confirm my earlier conclusions. Given the constraints that x is North of y and y is Southwest of z, region x can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of region z.

Actually, let me double check using a slightly different example, because I want to make sure we don't have to also consider North.

Imagine:
- Region y is at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- Region x is at (0.5, 2) with width and height of 1. (shifted to the right a bit)
- Region z is at (1, 3) with width and height of 1. (closer to the y-axis)

In this case:
- x N y? Yes, because x is directly above y. (The x-projection of x is still within the x-projection of y.)
- y SW z? Yes, because y is to the left and below z.
- Relation between x and z? x and z could overlap on the x-axis. But wait, that's not possible because the definition of y SW z means that the maximum x-coordinate of y (which is 1) is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z (also 1 in this case). I may need to adjust my example.

Ah, let me ensure the constraints are satisfied. The critical constraint here is from y SW z, which says supx(y) <= infx(z).

Let's revisit:
- Region y is at (0, 0) with width and height of 1. So, supx(y) = 1.
- Region z is at (1, 3) with width and height of 1. So, infx(z) = 1.

The constraint is satisfied as 1 <= 1. It's a boundary case.

Now, for x N y, we have supx(x) <= supx(y), which means the right edge of x can't be further right than the right edge of y.

If Region x is at (0.5, 2) with width and height of 1, then supx(x) = 1.5, which is greater than supx(y) = 1. This violates the constraint for x N y.

Let me adjust the example:
- Region y is at (0, 0) with width and height of 1. So, supx(y) = 1.
- Region x is at (0, 2) with width and height of 1. So, supx(x) = 1. This ensures the constraint supx(x) <= supx(y) for x N y.
- Region z is at (1, 3) with width and height of 1. So, infx(z) = 1. This ensures the constraint supx(y) <= infx(z) for y SW z.

In this case, infx(x) = 0 and supx(x) = 1, and for z, infx(z) = 1 and supx(z) = 2. This means the right edge of x coincides with the left edge of z. Is this still considered "x is to the left of z"?

Based on the definitions:
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

In our example:
- supx(x) = 1 and infx(z) = 1, so supx(x) <= infx(z) is satisfied.

This seems to imply that x is to the left of z, even if they touch at their boundaries.

Now, for the vertical relationship, in this example:
- infy(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 3
- infy(z) = 3 and supy(z) = 4

Since supy(x) = infy(z), the top of x coincides with the bottom of z. According to the definitions:
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For the W relation, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). In our example, infy(z) = 3 which is not <= infy(x) = 2. So, x is not West of z; it's Southwest of z.

Actually, I'm confusing myself. Let's clarify the conditions for the W relation once more.

For a W b:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is to the left of b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) (the bottom of a is above or at the same level as the bottom of b)
- supy(a) <= supy(b) (the top of a is below or at the same level as the top of b)

In our example, x and z have:
- supx(x) = 1 <= infx(z) = 1 (satisfied)
- infy(z) = 3 > infy(x) = 2 (not satisfied)
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(z) = 4 (satisfied)

Since infy(z) > infy(x), x is not West of z. It's Southwest of z.

Let me try one more example to see if North is also a possibility.

Imagine:
- Region y is at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- Region x is at (0, 1) with width and height of 1. (x is directly above y)
- Region z is at (2, 0) with width and height of 1. (z is to the right of y at the same height)

In this case:
- x N y? Yes, because x is directly above y.
- y SW z? No, because y is not southwest of z; it's to the left of z. For y to be SW of z, it should be to the left and below z. This example doesn't satisfy the given conditions.

Let me adjust again:
- Region y is at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- Region x is at (0, 1) with width and height of 1. (x is directly above y)
- Region z is at (2, 1) with width and height of 1. (z is to the right of y and slightly above)

In this case:
- x N y? Yes, because x is directly above y.
- y SW z? Yes, because y is to the left and below z.
- Relation between x and z? x is to the left of z and at the same height. This fits the W relation.

Actually, I realized I need to ensure infx(y) <= infx(x) for x N y. Let me adjust:
- Region y is at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- Region x is at (0, 1) with width and height of 1. (x is directly above y, touching at the left edge, which satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))
- Region z is at (2, 0.5) with width and height of 1. (z is to the right of y and slightly above, which satisfies supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z))

In this case:
- infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 2
- infy(z) = 0.5, supy(z) = 1.5

This means infy(x) > infy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z), which implies x is North of z.

Actually, wait a moment. The definition of North is:
- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of z is to the left or at the same position as the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left or at the same position as the right edge of z)

But in this case, infx(z) = 2 which is greater than infx(x) = 0.

So, x is not North of z, but it's Northwest of z (because x is to the left and above z).

I think we have now considered a range of examples and identified that the possible relations between x and z, given that x is North of y and y is Southwest of z, are:
- Northwest of z (if x is above z)
- West of z (if x is at the same height as z)
- Southwest of z (if x is below z)

But let's continue to check if we have exhausted all the possible relations.

What happens if z is very tall, so that its bottom is below x's bottom and its top is above x's top?

Imagine:
- Region y is at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- Region x is at (0, 1) with width and height of 1. (x is directly above y)
- Region z is at (2, 0) with width and height of 3. (z is to the right of y and spans a large vertical range)

In this case:
- x N y? Yes, because x is directly above y.
- y SW z? Yes, because y is to the left and below z.
- Relation between x and z? x is to the left of z and its vertical span is entirely within z's vertical span. This still fits the W relation.

Now, let's see if x can be NE, E, or SE of z.

For x to be E of z, it needs to be to the right of z. But from our constraints, x is within the x-projection of y and y is to the left of z. This means x can't be to the right of z, so it can't be E, NE, or SE of z.

Now, can x be N of z?

For x to be N of z, it needs to satisfy:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of z is to the left or at the same position as the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left or at the same position as the right edge of z)

From our constraints, x is within the x-projection of y and y is to the left of z. This means infx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which violates the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for x N z.

So, x can't be N of z.

Similarly, for x to be S of z, it would need to be below z. This is possible, but the condition supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) would mean x is to the left of z. So, if x is below z and to the left, it would be SW of z, not S of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is North of y and y is Southwest of z, are:
- NW (if x is to the left and above z)
- W (if x is to the left and its vertical span overlaps with z's)
- SW (if x is to the left and below z)

Actually, there's one more relation we need to check that I just realized: the B relation. B stands for the bounding box, and it's theoretically possible for x to be inside the bounding box of z.

Actually, that is inconsistent with the constraints. For x to be within the bounding box of z, it would need to be to the right of the left edge of z. But from our constraints, x is within the x-projection of y and y is to the left of z. This means x's right edge is to the left of z's left edge, so x can't be inside the bounding box of z.

So, our final answer is that the possible relations between x and z, given that x is North of y and y is Southwest of z, are:
- NW (if x is to the left and above z)
- W (if x is to the left and its vertical span overlaps with z's)
- SW (if x is to the left and below z)

Actually, I realized there may be a cleaner way to think about this. Let me re-reason.

Given that x is North of y and y is Southwest of z, let's determine where x can be relative to z.

1. x N y means:
   - x is strictly above y (supy(y) <= infy(x))
   - x is horizontally aligned with y (infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))

2. y SW z means:
   - y is strictly to the left of z (supx(y) <= infx(z))
   - y is strictly below z (supy(y) <= infy(z))

From these, we can derive:
- x is horizontally aligned with y, and y is strictly to the left of z. This means x is strictly to the left of z (supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)). If x is to the left of z, it can be one of: NW, W, or SW.

- x is strictly above y, and y is strictly below z. But this doesn't fully constrain the vertical relationship between x and z. So x could be:
  - Above z (making it NW)
  - At the same height as z (making it W)
  - Below z (making it SW)

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, W, or SW.

Actually, let me take a step back and just be extremely meticulous. Let me think about the cardinal direction relation between regions a and b in terms of constraints on the minimum bounding boxes (MBBs) of the regions.

1. a N b (a is North of b) means:
   - supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is above b)
   - infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) (a's x-projection is contained within b's)

2. a SW b (a is Southwest of b) means:
   - supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is to the left of b)
   - supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is below b)

When applying these, we can derive:

If x N y, then:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is contained within y's)

If y SW z, then:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can derive that supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), meaning x is to the left of z. And that's all we can derive from the given constraints.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, given that x N y and y SW z, are:
- NW (if x is to the left and above z)
- W (if x is to the left and aligned vertically with z)
- SW (if x is to the left and below z)

Let's just verify that's the right answer with a bunch of examples:

Example 1:
- y at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- x at (0, 1) with width and height of 1.
- z at (2, 0.5) with width and height of 1.

In this example, x is North of y, y is Southwest of z, and x is Northwest of z.

Example 2:
- y at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- x at (0, 1) with width and height of 1.
- z at (2, 1) with width and height of 1.

Here, x is North of y, y is Southwest of z, and x is West of z.

Example 3:
- y at (0, 0) with width and height of 1.
- x at (0, 1) with width and height of 1.
- z at (2, 1.5) with width and height of 1.

In this example, x is North of y, y is Southwest of z, and x is Southwest of z.

So, the answer is: NW, W, SW.

Actually, let me make very sure by specifically checking if x can be N, NE, E, SE, or S of z, where it's crystal clear that these are impossible.

Can x be N of z?
For x N z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we know supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for x N z. So, x can't be N of z.

Can x be NE of z?
For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). But we know supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which gives us supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). This contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for x NE z. So, x can't be NE of z.

Similarly, x can't be E, SE, or S of z because all of these would require x to be to the right of z or aligned with z, but we've established that x is to the left of z.

Can x be B of z?
For x B z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've already shown that the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) is contradicted by our derived constraint supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x can't be B of z.

So, our final answer is that the possible relations between x and z, given that x is North of y and y is Southwest of z, are:
NW, W, SW.

Actually let's triple check if there's a scenario where x can be N of z.

We are given:
- x is North of y (so x is directly above y, within y's width extent).
- y is Southwest of z (so y is to the left and below z).

Since x is within y's width, and y is to the left of z, x must also be to the left of z. In other words, no part of x's width can overlap with z's width. Since "North" requires x to be directly above z, this is impossible.

And the same rules applies for NE, E, SE, S, and B: all of these would require some overlap between x and z in the x dimension, which is excluded by the constraints.

Okay let me think again:

1. x N y means:
- x is directly above y (vertical projection)
- x's width is contained within y's width (horizontal projection)

2. y SW z means:
- y is to the left of z
- y is below z

Given that x's width is contained within y's, and y is to the left of z, we deduce that x is also to the left of z. 

From the first conditions, we know that x is above y. From the second, we know that y is below z. But we can't immediately deduce the vertical relationship between x and z.

x could be:
- Above z, making the relation x NW z
- At the same height as z, making the relation x W z
- Below z, making the relation x SW z

The possible relations between regions x and z are NW, W, and SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- x N y: Region x is north of region y
- y SW z: Region y is southwest of region z

From x N y, we know:
- x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y))

From y SW z, we know:
- y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z))
- y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

Combining these constraints:
- Since supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can deduce that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.
- We cannot determine the exact vertical relationship between x and z, as both are above y, but their relative vertical positions to each other are unconstrained.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
NW, W, SW
