PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This question asks about transitivity of the cardinal direction relation B (bounding box). Let's analyze what happens if region x is B of region y, and region y is B of region z.

For region x to be B of region y, the following should hold:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means that region x is completely contained within the bounding box of region y.

For region y to be B of region z, the following should hold:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means that region y is completely contained within the bounding box of region z.

Now, let's see if we can determine the relation between region x and region z. We need to combine the two conditions:

From the first set of inequalities:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From the second set of inequalities:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

We can combine these:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Which simplifies to:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

These are precisely the conditions for region x to be B of region z!

So, we've shown that if region x is B of region y, and region y is B of region z, then region x is B of region z.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is B.

Actually, I need to be careful with this analysis. I've assumed that because the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of z, then the relation between x and z is the B relation. But I need to check the formal definition of the relations again to be sure.

The B relation between regions x and z means that x is completely contained within the bounding box of z. This is consistent with what we derived:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

So indeed, region x is B of region z.

But I was actually asked about the possible relations, and there might be multiple possible relations depending on the specific configurations of the regions.

Let's reconsider. We have:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

These conditions are satisfied if region x is B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, or SE of region z. But the question is which of these relations are possible given the constraints.

Let's go through each relation:

- B (Bounding box): For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). These conditions match exactly what we derived, so B is a possible relation.

- S (South): For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we know that infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) (since regions are connected, infy(x) < supy(x)). So S is not a possible relation.

- SW (South West): For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know that infx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts these requirements. So SW is not a possible relation.

- W (West): For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we know that infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So W is not a possible relation.

- NW (North West): For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But we know that infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So NW is not a possible relation.

- N (North): For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we know that infy(z) <= infy(x) and (assuming regions are non-empty) infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradict the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x). So N is not a possible relation.

- NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But we know that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x). So NE is not a possible relation.

- E (East): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we know that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x). So E is not a possible relation.

- SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x). So SE is not a possible relation.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

Actually, I made an error in my analysis. I misremembered that I'd established that x is completely contained within z, but that's not what I proved. I established that the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of z, which is the definition of the B relation.

Let me restart the analysis. If region x is B of region y, and region y is B of region z, then we have:

Region x is B of region y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

Region y is B of region z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these inequalities, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Therefore, x is B of z. Now, let's consider all possible cardional directions relations between x and z.

B (Bounding box): As we've shown, the conditions for x to be B of z are satisfied, so B is a possible relation.

S (South): For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We already know that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), so those conditions are satisfied. But for the first condition: we've shown that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). Therefore, S is not a possible relation.

SW (South West): For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But we've shown that infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, SW is not a possible relation.

W (West): For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so those conditions are satisfied. But for the first condition: we've shown that infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, W is not a possible relation.

NW (North West): For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

But we've shown that infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). Additionally, we've shown that infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). Therefore, NW is not a possible relation.

N (North): For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), so those conditions are satisfied. But for the first condition: we've shown that infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). Therefore, N is not a possible relation.

NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

But we've shown that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). Additionally, we've shown that infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). Therefore, NE is not a possible relation.

E (East): For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so those conditions are satisfied. But for the first condition: we've shown that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). Therefore, E is not a possible relation.

SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But we've shown that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). Additionally, we've shown that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). Therefore, SE is not a possible relation.

Based on this systematic analysis, the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

Actually, I've been making a mistake. Let me restart the analysis once more.

We're asked to determine the possible relations between region x and region z, given that region x is B of region y, and region y is B of region z.

B (Bounding box): For region x to be B of region y, we need:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means that region x is completely contained within the bounding box of region y.

For region y to be B of region z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means that region y is completely contained within the bounding box of region z.

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, these inequalities are exactly the conditions for region x to be B of region z. But this doesn't mean that B is the only possible relation. It means that the bounding box of region x is within the bounding box of region z. But the actual regions could have different spatial relationships.

Let me draw diagrams to understand this better:

Case 1: Region x is B of region z:
```
+-----------------+ (region z)
|                 |
|    +--------+   | (region y)
|    |        |   |
|    |  +--+  |   | (region x)
|    |  |  |  |   |
|    |  +--+  |   |
|    |        |   |
|    +--------+   |
|                 |
+-----------------+
```

In this case, region x is completely within the bounding box of region z, not touching its boundary, which is the definition of the B relation.

Case 2: Region x is N of region z:
```
+-----------------+ (region y)
|                 |
|    +--------+   | (region x)
|    |        |   |
+-----------------+
|                 | (region z)
+-----------------+
```

In this case, region x is to the north of region z, which is the N relation.

But let's check if this is possible. For region x to be N of region z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), but we derived that infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, region x cannot be N of region z.

Similarly, we can show that region x cannot be S, SW, W, NW, NE, E, or SE of region z by checking the conditions against the derived inequalities.

Hmm, but I think I'm making a conceptual error here. Let's reconsider this problem.

The relation between regions a and b is determined by the relative position of region a with respect to the bounding box of region b. 

Let's look at the formal definitions again from the problem statement:

a B b if and only if:
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a)
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) <= infy(b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)

a SW b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b)
- supy(a) <= infy(b)

a W b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a)
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

a NW b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a)

a N b if and only if:
- supy(b) <= infy(a)
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)

a NE b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a)
- supy(b) <= infy(a)

a E b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a)
- infy(b) <= infy(a)
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

a SE b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a)
- supy(a) <= infy(b)

OK, so if we go back to what we've established:

We've established that if region x is B of region y, and region y is B of region z, then:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's check which relations are possible between region x and region z:

B (Bounding box): For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

These are precisely what we've established, so B is a possible relation.

S (South): For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know the second and third conditions are satisfied. But for the first condition: we have infy(z) <= infy(x), which means that the bottom of region x is above or at the same level as the bottom of region z. However, for x to be S of z, the top of region x should be below the bottom of region z, i.e., supy(x) <= infy(z). But we also know that infy(x) <= supy(x) (since region x is a connected region), so we have infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z). Therefore, S is not a possible relation.

SW (South West): For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But we know that infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) (since region x is connected), so this contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, SW is not a possible relation.

W (West): For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know the second and third conditions are satisfied. But for the first condition: we have infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, W is not a possible relation.

NW (North West): For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

But we know that infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). Additionally, we know that infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x). Therefore, NW is not a possible relation.

N (North): For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know the second and third conditions are satisfied. But for the first condition: we have infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x). Therefore, N is not a possible relation.

NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

But we know that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x). Additionally, we know that infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x). Therefore, NE is not a possible relation.

E (East): For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know the second and third conditions are satisfied. But for the first condition: we have infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x). Therefore, E is not a possible relation.

SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But we know that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x). Additionally, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z). Therefore, SE is not a possible relation.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

Actually, I may have been too quick to conclude with just B. Let me think more carefully.

I've been relying on the definitions strictly, but I need to consider that there may be configurations where the regions have multiple relations simultaneously.

Let's think about a specific configuration. If region x is B of region y, and region y is B of region z, then the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y, and the bounding box of y is contained within the bounding box of z.

Now, what's the relation between x and z? Given the constraints, the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of z. But this doesn't tell us the exact position of region x within the bounding box of z.

Actually, the original problem statement defined a cardinal direction relation as an expression R1: ... : Rk, where multiple relations can hold simultaneously. But for the purposes of this question, I think we're being asked for the single-tile relation between x and z.

Given what we've established, the only single-tile relation that can hold between region x and region z is the B relation. The other relations (S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) are not possible because they would contradict the constraints we've derived.

OK, let's think about a slightly more complex case:

What if region x is a combination of multiple tiles? For instance, what if region x is a combination of regions a and b, where a is B of y and b is N of y? In this case, x would be B:N of y.

Similarly, what if region y is a combination of multiple tiles? For instance, what if region y is a combination of regions c and d, where c is B of z and d is S of z? In this case, y would be B:S of z.

Now, what would be the relation between region x and region z? We would need to analyze how the positions of regions a and b relative to z.

But I think the problem assumes that we're dealing with single-tile relations, so the only relation between region x and region z is B.

Let me double check my understanding.

Cardinal relations are defined by the position of one region relative to the bounding box of another region. If region x is B of region y, it means the entirety of region x is contained within the bounding box of region y. If region y is B of region z, it means the entirety of region y is contained within the bounding box of region z.

Given these, region x is entirely contained within the bounding box of region z. Hence, the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

Wait, I think I'm confused with this approach. Let's take a step back and think about simpler cases.

If region a is N of region b, it means that region a is entirely above region b. If region b is N of region c, it means that region b is entirely above region c. Logically, region a is then entirely above region c, so region a is N of region c.

Using this kind of transitive reasoning for our problem:

If region x is B of region y, it means that region x is completely within the bounding box of region y. If region y is B of region z, it means that region y is completely within the bounding box of region z. 

The entirety of y is within the bounding box of z. The entirety of x is within the bounding box of y. By transitivity, the entirety of x is within the bounding box of z. This means x is B of z.

But I'm wondering if there are any other possibilities. Let's think about specific examples to see if other relations can arise.

Wait, I need to clarify whether "B of region y" means "region x is B of region y" or "region x is within region B of region y". I believe I've been using the former, which is the more natural interpretation. "B of region y" means that region x is completely within the bounding box of region y.

But what about the case where region x is split across different tiles? For instance, what if a part of region x is in the N tile of region y and another part is in the NE tile? Then region x would have the relation N:NE with region y.

However, the problem statement is quite clear when it defines the single-tile cardinal direction relations. So, if region x is B of region y, it means the entirety of region x is contained within the bounding box of region y.

Given this, if region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then region x is completely within the bounding box of region y, and region y is completely within the bounding box of region z. By transitivity, region x is completely within the bounding box of region z, which means region x is B of region z.

So, the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

Actually, I think my reasoning is circular. Let me restart once more.

We're trying to determine the possible relations between region x and region z, given that region x is B of region y, and region y is B of region z.

I'll use the cardinal direction relations as given in the problem statement:

If region x is B of region y, it means:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

If region y is B of region z, it means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

By transitivity, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

These inequalities show that region x is completely contained within the bounding box of region z, which is the definition of the B relation. Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is B.

But I need to consider if there are other possible relations.

For region x to have any other cardinal direction relation with region z, it would have to be positioned in a specific way relative to the bounding box of region z. For instance, for region x to be N of region z, the bottom of region x would have to be above the top of region z. However, from our derived inequalities, we know that infy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts the condition for the N relation.

Similarly, for each of the other cardinal direction relations (S, SW, W, NW, NE, E, SE), we can show that the conditions would be contradicted by our derived inequalities.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

But I should double-check.

Actually, a simpler way to think about this problem.

These 9 single-tile cardinal direction relation are disjoint and exhaustive. This means that for any two regions, exactly one of these 9 relations holds.

We know that if region x is B of region y, and region y is B of region z, then by transitivity, region x is completely within the bounding box of region z. Since this is the definition of the B relation, we know that the relation between region x and region z is B.

Since exactly one of the 9 relations holds, and we've determined that the B relation holds, the relation between region x and region z is B.

But I'd better double-check all the possible relations.

B (Bounding box): For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

These are exactly the inequalities we derived, so B is a possible relation.

S (South): For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

But we derived that infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which means that at least part of region x is at the same height or above the bottom of region z. This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for the S relation. Hence, S is not a possible relation.

OK, I see why I was confused. I've been trying to determine a unique relation between region x and region z, but the question asks for possible relations. Given the constraints, the only possible relation is B. So, the correct answer to the question is B. I'm confident this is correct.

Actually, I'm second guessing myself. Let me see if there are other possibilities.

Let's consider the definition of the B relation again. The B relation means that a region is completely contained within the bounding box of another region. That is, a B b if and only if:
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a)
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, if region x is B of region y, it means that region x is completely contained within the bounding box of region y. If region y is B of region z, it means that region y is completely contained within the bounding box of region z.

By transitivity, region x is completely contained within the bounding box of region z, which means region x is B of region z.

So, the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Looking at the definitions, it's clear that if region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then region x must be B of region z.

Hence, the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

Actually, I'm being overly cautious. Let's verify once more. Given that:

Region x is B of region y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

Region y is B of region z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

By combining these inequalities, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

These are exactly the conditions for region x to be B of region z.

Let me quickly check if any of the other relations (S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) are possible. For each of these relations, the conditions would contradict the derived inequalities, as I've explained earlier.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z given that x is B of y and y is B of z.

If x is B of y, the following must be true:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

If y is B of z, the following must be true:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these inequalities by transitivity:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These combined inequalities exactly match the definition of the B relation between x and z. Testing against other relations shows contradictions with these established inequalities.

Therefore, B is the only possible relation between region x and region z.
