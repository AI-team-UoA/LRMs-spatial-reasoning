PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's figure out the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

We know:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is E of region z

Let's break down what these relations mean according to the definitions:

x NW y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

y E z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically within or equal to z)

Now, I want to find the possible relations between x and z.

First, let's consider the x-coordinate relationships:
- From x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y)
- From y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y)

Combining these two, we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)

This means that supx(x) and supx(z) are both less than or equal to infx(y), but we don't have a direct comparison between supx(x) and supx(z). So x could be either to the west of z, or they could overlap in the x-dimension.

Now for the y-coordinate relationships:
- From x NW y: supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- From y E z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically within or equal to z)

From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we can't directly compare infy(x) and supy(z).

So there are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the west of z (W tile).
2. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the east of z (E tile).
3. If they overlap in the x-dimension, then we need to consider the y-dimension:
   a. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is to the north of z (N tile).
   b. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is to the south of z (S tile).
   c. If they overlap in both dimensions, x could be in the B (bounding box) tile.

Let me check if all these possibilities are consistent with the given constraints. 

First, we know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y). This means both x and z are to the west of y. But we also know that y is to the east of z, which means z is to the west of y. So for the x-coordinate, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y)

But this doesn't tell us the direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) or supx(z) and infx(x).

For the y-coordinate, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically within or equal to z)

From this, we can deduce that:
supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between infy(x) and supy(z) or supy(x) and infy(z).

So based on the given constraints, we can't narrow down to a single cardinal direction relation between x and z. We need to consider all possibilities.

Let's consider each of the 9 possible cardinal direction relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) between x and z, and check if they are consistent with the constraints.

1. x B z (x is in the bounding box of z)
   This means: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But we know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), which means both x and z are to the west of y. This doesn't contradict x B z. Similarly, the y-coordinate constraints don't contradict x B z. So x B z is a possibility.

Actually, hang on. I'm making an error in my reasoning. Let me start again.

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically within or equal to z)

I want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)

First I need to be careful about the definition. Let me recall the definition for NW from the question:

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

So x NW y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

And now let me recall the definition for E from the question:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So y E z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) 
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, from the x-coordinate relationships:
- We have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- We have supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)

But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between supx(x) and infx(z) or supx(z) and infx(x). So, x could be to the west, east, or overlap with z in the x-dimension.

From the y-coordinate relationships:
- We have supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- We have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

Combining these, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

But we don't have a direct comparison between infy(x) and supy(z) or supy(x) and infy(z). So, x could be to the north, south, or overlap with z in the y-dimension.

Given these constraints, x could be in any of the following relationships with z: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE.

Actually wait, this isn't right either. I think I'm having trouble carefully reasoning through all of the constraints. Let me try to be more systematic. 

Let me define the regions in the 2D plane:
- Let's say Region x has coordinates (x1, x2, y1, y2), meaning infx(x) = x1, supx(x) = x2, infy(x) = y1, supy(x) = y2.
- Similarly, Region y has coordinates (x3, x4, y3, y4).
- And Region z has coordinates (x5, x6, y5, y6).

From x NW y, we know:
- x2 <= x3 (supx(x) <= infx(y))
- y4 <= y1 (supy(y) <= infy(x))

From y E z, we know:
- x6 <= x3 (supx(z) <= infx(y))
- y5 <= y3 (infy(z) <= infy(y))
- y4 <= y6 (supy(y) <= supy(z))

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z. For each cardinal direction relation, I need to check if it's consistent with the constraints I've just derived.

1. x N z:
   This requires:
   - x5 <= x1 and x2 <= x6 (x is vertically aligned with z)
   - y6 <= y1 (x is to the north of z)
   
   From the constraints, I have:
   - No direct comparison between x5 and x1, or x2 and x6. So, the first condition could be satisfied.
   - From y4 <= y1 and y4 <= y6, I can't derive a direct comparison between y6 and y1. So, the second condition could be satisfied.
   
   Therefore, x N z is a possibility.

2. x NE z:
   This requires:
   - x6 <= x1 (x is to the east of z)
   - y6 <= y1 (x is to the north of z)
   
   From the constraints, I have:
   - I know x6 <= x3 and x2 <= x3, but this doesn't give a direct comparison between x6 and x1. So, the first condition could be satisfied.
   - As noted earlier, the condition y6 <= y1 could be satisfied.
   
   Therefore, x NE z is a possibility.

3. x NW z:
   This requires:
   - x2 <= x5 (x is to the west of z)
   - y6 <= y1 (x is to the north of z)
   
   From the constraints, I have:
   - I know x2 <= x3 and x6 <= x3, but this doesn't give a direct comparison between x2 and x5. So, the first condition could be satisfied.
   - As noted earlier, the condition y6 <= y1 could be satisfied.
   
   Therefore, x NW z is a possibility.

4. x E z:
   This requires:
   - x6 <= x1 (x is to the east of z)
   - y5 <= y1 and y2 <= y6 (x is vertically within or equal to z)
   
   From the constraints, I have:
   - I know x6 <= x3 and x2 <= x3, but this doesn't give a direct comparison between x6 and x1. So, the first condition could be satisfied.
   - I know y5 <= y3 and y4 <= y1, but this doesn't give a direct comparison between y5 and y1. Also, I don't have a direct comparison between y2 and y6. So, the second condition could be satisfied.
   
   Therefore, x E z is a possibility.

5. x W z:
   This requires:
   - x2 <= x5 (x is to the west of z)
   - y5 <= y1 and y2 <= y6 (x is vertically within or equal to z)
   
   From the constraints, I have:
   - I know x2 <= x3 and x6 <= x3, but this doesn't give a direct comparison between x2 and x5. So, the first condition could be satisfied.
   - As noted earlier, the vertical conditions could be satisfied.
   
   Therefore, x W z is a possibility.

6. x SE z:
   This requires:
   - x6 <= x1 (x is to the east of z)
   - y2 <= y5 (x is to the south of z)
   
   From the constraints, I have:
   - I know x6 <= x3 and x2 <= x3, but this doesn't give a direct comparison between x6 and x1. So, the first condition could be satisfied.
   - I know y5 <= y3 and y4 <= y1, but this doesn't give a direct comparison between y2 and y5. So, the second condition could be satisfied.
   
   Therefore, x SE z is a possibility.

7. x SW z:
   This requires:
   - x2 <= x5 (x is to the west of z)
   - y2 <= y5 (x is to the south of z)
   
   From the constraints, I have:
   - I know x2 <= x3 and x6 <= x3, but this doesn't give a direct comparison between x2 and x5. So, the first condition could be satisfied.
   - As noted earlier, the condition y2 <= y5 could be satisfied.
   
   Therefore, x SW z is a possibility.

8. x S z:
   This requires:
   - x5 <= x1 and x2 <= x6 (x is vertically aligned with z)
   - y2 <= y5 (x is to the south of z)
   
   From the constraints, I have:
   - As noted earlier, the horizontal alignment condition could be satisfied.
   - As noted earlier, the condition y2 <= y5 could be satisfied.
   
   Therefore, x S z is a possibility.

9. x B z:
   This requires:
   - x5 <= x1 and x2 <= x6 (x is horizontally within or equal to z)
   - y5 <= y1 and y2 <= y6 (x is vertically within or equal to z)
   
   From the constraints, I have:
   - As noted earlier, the horizontal conditions could be satisfied.
   - As noted earlier, the vertical conditions could be satisfied.
   
   Therefore, x B z is a possibility.

Wait, this doesn't feel right. It seems like I'm saying every cardinal direction relation is possible, which can't be correct. Let's rethink. Maybe I need to be more careful about deriving relationships between the bounds.

Actually, I think the issue is I'm not considering all the constraints together.

Let's see what else we can infer from the constraints.

From x NW y, we have:
- x2 <= x3 (supx(x) <= infx(y))
- y4 <= y1 (supy(y) <= infy(x))

From y E z, we have:
- x6 <= x3 (supx(z) <= infx(y))
- y5 <= y3 (infy(z) <= infy(y))
- y4 <= y6 (supy(y) <= supy(z))

Additional deductions:
- From y4 <= y1 and y5 <= y3, we can't directly compare y5 and y1.
- From y4 <= y1 and y4 <= y6, we can't directly compare y6 and y1.
- From x2 <= x3 and x6 <= x3, we can't directly compare x2 and x6.

The key issue is that the constraints don't provide direct comparisons for many pairs of bounds. The NW and E relations are in different parts of the plane, so without further constraints, there's still quite a bit of freedom in the relative positions of x and z.

Ok, let's try again. I was working with:
- Let's say Region x has coordinates (x1, x2, y1, y2), meaning infx(x) = x1, supx(x) = x2, infy(x) = y1, supy(x) = y2.
- Similarly, Region y has coordinates (x3, x4, y3, y4).
- And Region z has coordinates (x5, x6, y5, y6).

From x NW y, we know:
- x2 <= x3 (supx(x) <= infx(y))
- y4 <= y1 (supy(y) <= infy(x))

From y E z, we know:
- x6 <= x3 (supx(z) <= infx(y))
- y5 <= y3 (infy(z) <= infy(y))
- y4 <= y6 (supy(y) <= supy(z))

The constraint x2 <= x3 means that x is to the west of y, and the constraint x6 <= x3 means that z is to the west of y. So both x and z are to the west of y. But this doesn't give us any direct comparison between x and z in the x-dimension.

The constraint y4 <= y1 means that x is to the north of y. And the constraints y5 <= y3 and y4 <= y6 mean that y is vertically within z. But again, this doesn't give us any direct comparison between x and z in the y-dimension.

Actually, let's draw a diagram to see if it helps.

Given the constraints:
- x NW y: x is to the northwest of y
- y E z: y is to the east of z

z       y
   x

Maybe this diagram is not completely accurate, but it helps to visualize the situation. 

From this diagram, we can see that:
1. x is definitely not SE of z (because x is NW of y, which is E of z).
2. x is definitely not S of z (again, because x is NW of y, which is E of z).
3. x is definitely not E of z (as both x and z are to the west of y, and for x to be E of z, x would need to be to the east of z, which is inconsistent).

Let's verify these intuitions with the formal constraints.

1. x is not SE of z:
   For x SE z, we need:
   - x6 <= x1 (x is to the east of z)
   - y2 <= y5 (x is to the south of z)
   
   But from the constraints, we have:
   - y4 <= y1 (supy(y) <= infy(x))
   - y5 <= y3 (infy(z) <= infy(y))
   
   If we combine these, we get y5 <= y3 < y4 <= y1, which means y5 < y1. This contradicts the condition y2 <= y5 for x SE z (since y2 < y1). So, x cannot be SE of z.

Wait, hang on. If y5 < y1, we can't derive a contradiction with y2 <= y5 because we don't know the relation between y2 and y1. All we know is that y1 is the lower y-coordinate of region x.

Let me think about this more carefully.

Ah I see a mistake I'm making. I was making an an implicit assumption about the bounds of a region. The full specification of a region in REG is not just the minimum bounding box, but rather a shape that is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This is a topological constraint. The minimum bounding box (described by infx, supx, infy, supy) is a rectangular region that contains the actual region.

Let's assume that regions x, y, and z are all exact rectangles, for simplicity's sake. In this case, the minimum bounding box is identical to the region itself.

Let's try a different approach. We'll consider the conditions for each cardinal direction relation between x and z, and check if they are consistent with the constraints.

The only constraints we have are:
- x2 <= x3 (x is to the west of y)
- y4 <= y1 (x is to the north of y)
- x6 <= x3 (z is to the west of y)
- y5 <= y3 (z extends below y)
- y4 <= y6 (z extends above y)

1. x N z:
   Conditions for x N z:
   - x5 <= x1 and x2 <= x6 (x is within z's x-range)
   - y6 <= y1 (x is above z)
   
   Given the constraint y4 <= y6, z extends above y. But the constraint y4 <= y1 just tells us that x is above y. We don't know if x is above the entire z or just the part of z that doesn't extend above y. So, x N z is possible.

2. x NE z:
   Conditions for x NE z:
   - x6 <= x1 (x is to the east of z)
   - y6 <= y1 (x is above z)
   
   From the constraints, we have x6 <= x3, which means z is to the west of y, and x2 <= x3, which means x is to the west of y. This doesn't give us a direct comparison between x6 and x1. So, x NE z is possible.

3. x E z:
   Conditions for x E z:
   - x6 <= x1 (x is to the east of z)
   - y5 <= y1 and y2 <= y6 (x is within z's y-range)
   
   From the constraints, we have x6 <= x3 and x2 <= x3, which means both z and x are to the west of y. This doesn't give us a direct comparison between x6 and x1. So, x E z is possible.

4. x SE z:
   Conditions for x SE z:
   - x6 <= x1 (x is to the east of z)
   - y2 <= y5 (x is below z)
   
   From the constraints, we have y4 <= y1 (x is above y) and y5 <= y3 (z extends below y). If y5 = y3, then y4 <= y1 and y5 = y3 < y4 together imply y5 < y1. For x SE z, we need y2 <= y5 (x is below z), which means y2 <= y5 < y1. But since y2 < y1 by definition (y1 is the lower bound of x's y-coordinate), this doesn't lead to a contradiction.

   Actually, the relation y5 = y3 is not a given; we only know y5 <= y3. So we can't conclude anything definitive here.

Actually, maybe we can make the constraints more explicit by considering the definitions of the cardinal directions more carefully. I was defining them in terms of the min bounding box coordinates, but I should be using the definitions provided.

let me try to be consistent with the definitions. These are:

- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

So, x NW y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

And y E z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends below or equals y at the bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends above or equals y at the top)

Let me check each possible cardinal direction relation between x and z.

1. x NW z:
   This requires:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
   
   We know:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
   
   There's no contradiction in the conditions for x NW z, so this is possible.

2. x N z:
   This requires:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within z's x-range)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
   
   We know:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
   
   There's no contradiction in the conditions for x N z, so this is possible.

Actually, hang on. I'm getting confused again because I'm trying to extend the conditions for the individual rations (S, SW, etc.) to combined regions. The problem should be a bit simpler if I just stick to the original 9 relations.

Alright, let's approach this differently. Let's determine if each of the 9 cardinal direction relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) between x and z is consistent with the constraints.

We know:
- x NW y means: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z means: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For clarity, I'll use the notation from the image: the four corners of a region's bounding box. For region x, these would be (x1, y1) (bottom-left) and (x2, y2) (top-right). Similarly for regions y and z.

So, x NW y means:
- x2 <= y1 (x is to the west of y)
- y2 <= x1 (x is to the north of y)

And y E z means:
- z2 <= y1 (y is to the east of z)
- z1 <= y1 (z extends below or equals y at the bottom)
- y2 <= z2 (z extends above or equals y at the top)

Now, let's check each of the 9 cardinal directions for the relation between x and z:

1. x B z:
   This requires: z1 <= x1, x2 <= z2, z3 <= x3, x4 <= z4.
   
   Wait, hang on. I got confused with the numbering. Let's use a different notation:
   
   For region x, the bounding box is (infx(x), infy(x)) (bottom-left) and (supx(x), supy(x)) (top-right).
   Similarly for regions y and z.
   
   Now, x NW y means:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
   
   And y E z means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends below or equals y at the bottom)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends above or equals y at the top)

   Let's check if these constraints allow x B z:
   - x B z requires: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y) and supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z), but these don't help us determine if supx(x) <= supx(z).
   
   Similarly, the other conditions for x B z can't be derived from the given constraints. So, x B z is possible.

I think I'm getting caught in the weeds too much. Instead of trying to check every condition, let me take a more direct approach.

From x NW y, we know:
- x is to the west and north of y.

From y E z, we know:
- y is to the east of z.
- y is within the y-range of z.

Using a diagram again:

```
    x
    
z   y
```

This diagram suggests that x could be:
- NW of z
- N of z
- W of z

Let's verify if other relations are possible as well.

For x NE z:
- x is to the east of z (infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x))
- x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x))

From the given constraints, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends above or equals y at the top)

From supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), we can't determine the relation between supx(x) and supx(z). So, x NE z is possible if supx(x) and supx(z) are positioned correctly.

Actually I think the right approch to keep this simple is:

Given the constraints:
- x NW y (x is to the northwest of y)
- y E z (y is to the east of z)

What can we infer about the positions of x, y, and z on the coordinate plane?

From x NW y, we know:
- x is to the west of y, meaning supx(x) <= infx(y).
- x is to the north of y, meaning supy(y) <= infy(x).

From y E z, we know:
- y is to the east of z, meaning supx(z) <= infx(y).
- y is within the y-range of z, meaning infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Given these constraints, let's think about the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. In the x-dimension:
   - From supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), we know both x and z are to the west of y.
   - But we can't determine the direct relationship between x and z in the x-dimension from these constraints.
   - So, x could be to the west, east, or overlap with z in the x-dimension.

2. In the y-dimension:
   - From supy(y) <= infy(x), we know x is to the north of y.
   - From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we know y is within the y-range of z.
   - Combining these, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
   - But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between infy(x) and supy(z), so we can't determine if x is entirely above z.
   - Similarly, we can't determine if x is below z or overlaps with z in the y-dimension.

Given these observations, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- NW (x is to the northwest of z)
- N (x is to the north of z)
- NE (x is to the northeast of z)
- W (x is to the west of z)
- B (x is within the bounding box of z)
- E (x is to the east of z)
- SW (x is to the southwest of z)
- S (x is to the south of z)
- SE (x is to the southeast of z)

Wait, that's all of them! That doesn't seem right.

Let's revisit the constraints more carefully.

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends below or equals y at the bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends above or equals y at the top)

Now, let's see if we can determine any constraints on the relative positions of x and z.

From supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), we know both x and z are to the west of y. But we can't determine the direct relationship between x and z in the x-dimension.

From supy(y) <= infy(x), we know x is to the north of y. And from infy(z) <= infy(y), we know z extends below or equals y at the bottom.

Combining these, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between infy(x) and infy(z).

Similarly, from supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we don't get a direct comparison between infy(x) and supy(z).

So, from the given constraints, we can't determine a specific cardinal direction relation between x and z.

However, let's think more intuitively about the problem. If:
- x is to the northwest of y,
- y is to the east of z,

Then it seems likely that x is not to the east or southeast of z, since both x and z are to the west of y.

Hm, let's try to approach this more methodically again. I've been going back and forth and it's been hard to make progress.

Let me try a different approach: considering specific examples or diagrams that satisfy the constraints, and then checking which cardinal directions are possible.

Given constraints:
- x NW y (x is to the northwest of y)
- y E z (y is to the east of z)

Let's imagine a coordinate plane and place the regions accordingly.

We can place z at (0, 0) and y at (3, 0), ensuring that y is to the east of z. Since y E z also requires that y is within the y-range of z, let's say z extends from (0, -1) to (2, 1). And y extends from (3, -0.5) to (4, 0.5). This satisfies y E z.

Now, we need to place x such that it's to the northwest of y. We can place x at (1, 2), ensuring it's to the west and north of y.

With these placements:
- z has a bounding box: (0, -1) to (2, 1).
- y has a bounding box: (3, -0.5) to (4, 0.5).
- x has a bounding box: (1, 2) to (2, 3).

Now, let's check the cardinal direction relation between x and z.

With respect to the x-dimension, x is within the x-range of z (since 0 <= 1 and 2 <= 2). With respect to the y-dimension, x is completely above z (since 1 < 2).

According to the cardinal direction definitions, x is N of z in this example. 

But we could also place x at, say, (-1, 2), which would make x NW of z.

Actually you know what, I think I've been overthinking. Let's break it down much more simply using a diagram. These relationships are

```
    x
    
z   y
```

From the diagram, it's clear that:
- x is to the west and north of y.
- y is to the east of z.

Given this layout, when we're asked about the possible relationships between x and z, we're essentially asking where x is relative to z.

Now, if we ignore any constraints for a moment and just consider the possibilities based on the layout:
- x could be to the northwest of z (if x is positioned far enough to the west).
- x could be to the north of z (if x is directly above z).
- x could be to the northeast of z (if x is positioned far enough to the east, but still west of y).
- x could be to the west of z (if x is directly to the west of z).
- x could be within the bounding box of z (if z is large enough).
- x could be to the east of z (if x is directly to the east of z, but still west of y).
- x could be to the southwest of z (if x is positioned far enough to the west and is lower than the top of z).
- x could be to the south of z (if x is directly below z).
- x could be to the southeast of z (if x is positioned far enough to the east, but still west of y, and is lower than the top of z).

Ah, but wait. There's a critical constraint I've been missing. From supy(y) <= infy(x), we know x is to the north of y. From infy(z) <= infy(y), we know z extends below or equals y at the bottom. This means the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y. But the top of y is below the bottom of x. So, the bottom of z is below the bottom of x.

But this doesn't tell us if x is completely above z (N), or northwest of z (NW), or northeast of z (NE), or west of z (W), or east of z (E), or within the bounding box of z (B). It only tells us that x is not completely below z.

So, the southeast (SE), south (S), and southwest (SW) cardinal direction relations between x and z are ruled out.

But I think we are also missing which I've missed again is the constraints from y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends below or equals y at the bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends above or equals y at the top)

Those, the constraint supy(y) <= supy(z) is important: it means the top of z is above or at the same level as the top of y. From supy(y) <= infy(x), we know x is to the north of y. This means the bottom of x is above the top of y. But the top of z is above the top of y. So, the bottom of x could be below the top of z, which means x might not be completely above z.

So, the north (N), northeast (NE), and northwest (NW) cardinal direction relations between x and z are not ruled out yet.

Similarly, the bounding box (B), west (W), and east (E) relations are not ruled out yet.

So, out of the 9 cardinal direction relations, we've ruled out:
- SE (southeast)
- S (south)
- SW (southwest)

The remaining 6 relations (NW, N, NE, W, B, E) are all possibilities based on the contraints. 

Acutally, wait. Let me reconsider the constraint supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z):

This means the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of y. From supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y), we know the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y.

Based on these constraints, both x and z are to the west of y. But this doesn't give us any direct comparison between the positions of x and z in the x-dimension.

So, x could still be to the east of z, or to the west of z, or overlap with z in the x-dimension.

This means the relations E (east), NE (northeast), and SE (southeast) between x and z are still possibilities, despite the constraint that both x and z are to the west of y.

Actually, sorry, I'm getting hung up in the details too much. Let's step back and think about the problem from a higher level.

Given the constraints:
- x NW y: x is to the northwest of y.
- y E z: y is to the east of z.

I need to determine the possible cardinal directions between x and z. Now, let me try to use a visual representation to make it clearer.

Given that x is to the northwest of y, and y is to the east of z, we can say:
- x is to the northwest of y.
- y is to the east of z.

Picture this on a coordinate plane: z is someowhere to the west of y, and x is somewhere to the northwest of y.

z is somewhere here:
```
   z
```

y is to the east of z:
```
   z     y
```

and x is to the northwest of y:
```
        x
   z     y
```

Looking at this diagram, we see that x is to the west of y, and z is also to the west of y. But we don't know exactly where x is relative to z. It could be to the north, northwest, northeast, west, east, or even within z's bounding box.

But we do know x is to the north of y, and y is within the y-range of z. This means x could be to the north, northeast, northwest, or east of z, but might not be completely to the south, southeast, or southwest of z.

Actually that's not quite right. Let me double check using the conditions again:
- x NW y means: supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y).
- y E z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z), infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends below or equals y at the bottom), and supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends above or equals y at the top).

From y E z, we know that z extends both below and above y. From x NW y, we know x is to the north of y. But since z extends above y, it's possible that x is not entirely above z.

So, x could be:
- NW of z (if x is to the west and north of z).
- N of z (if x is directly above z).
- NE of z (if x is to the east and north of z).
- W of z (if x is directly to the west of z).
- B (if x is within the bounding box of z).
- E of z (if x is directly to the east of z).

But, x cannot be:
- SW of z (x is to the north of y, which is within the y-range of z, so x can't be entirely to the south and west of z).
- S of z (again, x is to the north of y, so it can't be entirely to the south of z).
- SE of z (x is to the west of y, which is to the east of z, so x can't be to the southeast of z).

Wrong again! Let's trace through it one more time. If:
- x NW y: x is to the northwest of y.
- y E z: y is to the east of z.

Then:
1. x is to the west of y (supx(x) <= infx(y)).
2. x is to the north of y (supy(y) <= infy(x)).
3. y is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(y)).
4. z extends below or equals y at the bottom (infy(z) <= infy(y)).
5. z extends above or equals y at the top (supy(y) <= supy(z)).

Now, from 1 and 3, we can say that x and z are both to the west of y. But we don't know their relative positioning in the x-dimension.

From 2, 4, and 5, we know:
- x is to the north of y.
- z extends both below and above y.

When we combine these constraints, we can see that x could be:
- NW of z (if x is to the west and north of z).
- N of z (if x is directly above z).
- NE of z (if x is to the east and north of z).
- W of z (if x is directly to the west of z).
- E of z (if x is directly to the east of z).
- B within z (if x is inside z's bounding box).

Now, let's check if x can be SW, S, or SE of z:

SE of z: For x to be SE of z, x needs to be to the east and south of z. From our constraints:
- x is to the west of y (supx(x) <= infx(y)).
- y is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(y)).
So, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), which means both x and z are to the west of y. But this doesn't tell us their exact positions relative to each other. So, x could be to the east of z and still satisfy these constraints.

But another condition for x to be SE of z is that x is to the south of z. Given:
- x is to the north of y (supy(y) <= infy(x)).
- z extends below or equals y at the bottom (infy(z) <= infy(y)).
If we combine these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) < infy(x). This means the bottom of z is below the bottom of x. But for x to be SE of z, x should be to the south of z, which requires supy(x) <= infy(z) (the top of x is below the bottom of z). But this contradicts infy(z) < infy(x) (the bottom of z is below the bottom of x).

So, x cannot be SE of z based on the given constraints.

S of z: For x to be S of z, x needs to be directly below z. Using the same reasoning as for SE of z, we know infy(z) < infy(x), which means the bottom of z is below the bottom of x. But for x to be S of z, x should be to the south of z, which requires supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts infy(z) < infy(x). So, x cannot be S of z based on the given constraints.

SW of z: For x to be SW of z, x needs to be to the west and south of z. Using the same reasoning as for SE of z, we can see that x cannot be to the south of z given the constraints. So, x cannot be SW of z.

So, out of the 9 cardinal direction relations, only 6 (NW, N, NE, W, B, E) are possibilities for the relationship between x and z based on the given constraints.

Actually wait. I still think I'm getting this wrong. Let me double-check the reasoning for SW, S, and SE.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- x is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)).
- x is to the south of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)).

From our constraints, we have:
- x is to the west of y (supx(x) <= infx(y)).
- x is to the north of y (supy(y) <= infy(x)).
- y is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(y)).
- z extends below or equals y at the bottom (infy(z) <= infy(y)).
- z extends above or equals y at the top (supy(y) <= supy(z)).

For x to be to the east of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). Given supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y), we can have supx(z) <= infx(x) if z and x are positioned correctly. So, this condition is possible.

But for x to be to the south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). Given supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we have infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x). This means infy(z) < infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (since supy(x) > infy(x) by definition).

So, x cannot be SE of z based on the given constraints.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- x is aligned with z in the x-dimension (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)).
- x is to the south of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)).

Given the constraints, the first condition might be satisfied. But, as we've seen above, the second condition cannot be satisfied because we have infy(z) < infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, x cannot be S of z based on the given constraints.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- x is to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)).
- x is to the south of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)).

Given the constraints, the first condition might be satisfied. But, as we've seen above, the second condition cannot be satisfied.

So, x cannot be SW of z based on the given constraints.

Similarly, for x to be B of z, we need:
- x is within the x-range of z (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)).
- x is within the y-range of z (infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)).

Given the constraints, the first condition might be satisfied. The second condition requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so the first part (infy(z) <= infy(x)) is satisfied. But we don't have a direct constraint to ensure supy(x) <= supy(z).

Wait, actually I do think x can be in the B relation with z. We need to check if:
- x is within the x-range of z (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)).
- x is within the y-range of z (infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)).

From the constraints, we know:
- x is to the west of y (supx(x) <= infx(y)).
- x is to the north of y (supy(y) <= infy(x)).
- y is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(y)).
- z extends below or equals y at the bottom (infy(z) <= infy(y)).
- z extends above or equals y at the top (supy(y) <= supy(z)).

For x to be within the x-range of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Given the constraints, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y). This means both x and z are to the west of y, but we can't directly compare supx(x) and supx(z).

For x to be within the y-range of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we can infer infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) < infy(x). But we can't directly compare supy(x) and supy(z) from the constraints.

So, x could be in relation B with z, but we can't say for sure.

Similarly, for the other relations (NW, N, NE, W, E), we can't rule them out based on the constraints. 

But for SW, S, and SE, as we've established, x cannot be in these relations with z because x is to the north of y, and y is within the y-range of z, which means x is to the north of at least part of z.

Given my analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: NW, N, NE, W, E, B. The relations SW, S, and SE are not possible based on the given constraints.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what constraints are placed on the positions of regions x, z, and y based on the given relations.

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can determine:
1. x is to the west of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))
2. x is to the north of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
3. z is to the west of y (supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
4. z extends below or equal to y at the bottom (infy(z) ≤ infy(y))
5. z extends above or equal to y at the top (supy(y) ≤ supy(z))

Combining points 2, 4, and 5:
- Since x is north of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- And z extends below y (infy(z) ≤ infy(y))
- We can infer: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This means the bottom of x is above some part of z, making it impossible for x to be completely south of z. Therefore, the relations SW, S, and SE are ruled out.

For the x-dimension, both x and z are west of y, but we cannot determine their exact relative positions.

The possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, NE, W, E, B
