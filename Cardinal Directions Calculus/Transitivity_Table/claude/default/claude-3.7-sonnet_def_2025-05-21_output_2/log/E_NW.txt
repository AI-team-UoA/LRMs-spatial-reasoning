PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. Region x is E of region y:
   - This means x is to the East of y
   - According to the definition: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
   - In other words, x is completely to the right of y (no overlap in x-coordinates) and vertically, x is within the y-range or partially overlapping.

2. Region y is NW of region z:
   - This means y is to the Northwest of z
   - According to the definition: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
   - In other words, y is completely to the left of z (no overlap in x-coordinates) and completely above z (no overlap in y-coordinates).

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

From the information above:
- x is to the right of y
- y is to the left of z
- y is above z

The x-coordinates:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)

We can't directly determine a relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z) from these constraints.

The y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

Combining these:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means x is definitely above z (or at least, the bottom of x is above the top of z). However, the relative horizontal positioning of x and z isn't completely constrained.

Given these constraints, what cardinal direction relations are possible for x relative to z?

1. North (N): If x is directly above z (with some x-overlap).
2. Northeast (NE): If x is above and to the right of z.
3. East (E): If x is directly to the right of z (with some y-overlap).
4. Northwest (NW): If x is above and to the left of z.
5. Southeast (SE): If x is below and to the right of z.
6. South (S): If x is directly below z (with some x-overlap).
7. Southwest (SW): If x is below and to the left of z.
8. West (W): If x is directly to the left of z (with some y-overlap).
9. Bounding box (B): If z contains x.

Now, let's analyze each:

N: Possible. If x is directly above z with some x-overlap, and if x is to the right of y, it's possible for x to be N of z.

NE: Possible. If x is to the right of z and above z, it satisfies the constraints.

E: Possible. If x is to the right of z with some y-overlap, it satisfies the constraints.

NW: Not possible. If x is NW of z, it means x is to the left of z. But x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z, so x cannot be to the left of z.

SE: Not possible. If x is SE of z, it means x is below z. But we established that x is above z.

S: Not possible. If x is S of z, it means x is below z. But we established that x is above z.

SW: Not possible. If x is SW of z, it means x is to the left of z and below z. But x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z, so x cannot be to the left of z. Additionally, x is above z.

W: Not possible. If x is W of z, it means x is to the left of z. But x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z, so x cannot be to the left of z.

B: Not possible. If z bounds x, it means x is inside z. But x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z, so x cannot be inside z.

Actually, I'm not sure about some of my reasoning. Let me double-check. 

We know:
- x is E of y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)

From the constraints, we can't directly determine if x is to the left or right of z.

For the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

Combining these:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means the top of z is below the bottom of y, and the bottom of y is below or at the same level as the bottom of x. This implies that the top of z is below the bottom of x, or x is above z.

Now, let's re-analyze the possible relations:

N: Possible. If x is directly above z with x-overlap.

NE: Possible. If x is to the right of z and above z.

E: Possible. If x is to the right of z with y-overlap. But wait, we said x is above z? Let me think more.

Actually, E is not possible because x is above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), which contradicts the definition of E where there should be y-coordinate overlap.

NW: Could be possible if x is to the left of z and above z. But is this consistent with our constraints?

From x E y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of y.
From y NW z, we have supx(y) <= infx(z), which means z is to the right of y.

But this doesn't tell us the relationship between x and z in the x-dimension. x could be to the left or right of z.

So, NW is possible if x is to the left of z and above z.

SE, S, SW, W: Not possible because x is above z.

B: Not possible because x is above z.

Wait, I need to think more carefully about this. Let's check the constraints again.

We know:
- x is E of y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

For the x-coordinates:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (z is to the right of y)

These constraints tell us that both x and z are to the right of y, but they don't specify the relationship between x and z in the x-dimension. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or even overlapping with z in the x-dimension.

For the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x is within y's y-range or overlapping)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), we can infer that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y).

But this doesn't definitively tell us the relationship between x and z in the y-dimension. We know z is below y, but x could be within y's y-range.

Actually, from infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of y is below or at the same level as the bottom of x) and supy(z) <= infy(y) (the top of z is below the bottom of y), we can infer that supy(z) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x).

This means x is above z.

Actually, let me draw this out to better understand the constraints.

Given constraints:
- Region x is E of region y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- Region y is NW of region z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let me visualize:

1. x is E of y:
   ```
   +------+  +-----+
   |      |  |     |
   |  y   |  |  x  |
   |      |  |     |
   +------+  +-----+
   ```

2. y is NW of z:
   ```
   +------+
   |      |
   |  y   |
   |      |
   +------+
          +------+
          |      |
          |  z   |
          |      |
          +------+
   ```

Combined:
   ```
   +------+  +-----+
   |      |  |     |
   |  y   |  |  x  |
   |      |  |     |
   +------+  +-----+
          +------+
          |      |
          |  z   |
          |      |
          +------+
   ```

Given this visualization, it becomes clear that x can be:

1. N of z: If x is directly above z with x-coordinate overlap.
2. NE of z: If x is to the right and above z.
3. E of z: If x is to the right of z with y-coordinate overlap.
4. NW of z: If x is to the left and above z.

Wait, I need to be careful. Let's double-check the constraints:

- Region x is E of region y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- Region y is NW of region z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (z is to the right of y)

We don't have a direct relationship between x and z in the x-dimension.

For the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-range is contained within or overlapping with y's y-range)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)

This confirms that x is above z, so the possible relations are N, NE, NW.

But hang on, x is E of y, which means x is to the right of y. And y is NW of z, which means y is to the left of z. Does that constrain the x-position of x relative to z?

From x E y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of y.
From y NW z, we have supx(y) <= infx(z), which means z is to the right of y.

But these constraints don't directly tell us the relationship between x and z in the x-dimension. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or even overlapping with z in the x-dimension.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N: If x is directly above z with x-coordinate overlap.
- NE: If x is to the right and above z.
- NW: If x is to the left and above z.

Wait, let's refine. For E, we have:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

Applying this to "x is E of y", we get:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of y is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y)

For NW, we have:

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

Applying this to "y is NW of z", we get:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (the top of z is below the bottom of y)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- x is to the right of y
- z is to the right of y
- x's y-range is within y's y-range
- z is below y

We know x is to the right of y and z is also to the right of y. But this doesn't determine the relationship between x and z in the x-dimension.

Given that x is within y's y-range and z is below y, we can say that x and z don't overlap in the y-dimension. Specifically, x is above z.

Now, I need to update the possible relations between x and z:
- N: If x is directly above z with x-coordinate overlap.
- NE: If x is to the right and above z.
- NW: If x is to the left and above z.

Actually, let me go back to my visualization to make sure I'm clear.

1. x is E of y:
   ```
   +------+  +-----+
   |      |  |     |
   |  y   |  |  x  |
   |      |  |     |
   +------+  +-----+
   ```

2. y is NW of z:
   ```
   +------+
   |      |
   |  y   |
   |      |
   +------+
          +------+
          |      |
          |  z   |
          |      |
          +------+
   ```

Combined:
   ```
   +------+  +-----+
   |      |  |     |
   |  y   |  |  x  |
   |      |  |     |
   +------+  +-----+
          +------+
          |      |
          |  z   |
          |      |
          +------+
   ```

I can now see the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. N: If x is directly above z.
2. NE: If x is to the right and above z.
3. NW: If x is to the left and above z.

But wait, let's re-evaluate "x is E of y".

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

For "x is E of y":
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of y is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y)

For our visualization, let's restrict ourselves to the case where x is strictly to the east of y, and y is strictly to the northwest of z:

1. x is strictly E of y:
   ```
   +------+       +-----+
   |      |       |     |
   |  y   |       |  x  |
   |      |       |     |
   +------+       +-----+
   ```

2. y is strictly NW of z:
   ```
   +------+
   |      |
   |  y   |
   |      |
   +------+
              +------+
              |      |
              |  z   |
              |      |
              +------+
   ```

3. Combined:
   ```
   +------+       +-----+
   |      |       |     |
   |  y   |       |  x  |
   |      |       |     |
   +------+       +-----+
              +------+
              |      |
              |  z   |
              |      |
              +------+
   ```

From this visualization, it seems x can be:
1. N of z: If x is directly above z with x-coordinate overlap.
2. NE of z: If x is to the right and above z.

But can x be NW of z? Let's see:

For x to be NW of z:
- x should be to the left of z, which means supx(x) <= infx(z)
- x should be above z, which means supy(z) <= infy(x)

We already know that x is above z from our constraints. But for x to be to the left of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).

Given that x is to the right of y (supx(y) <= infx(x)) and z is to the right of y (supx(y) <= infx(z)), can x be to the left of z?

It's possible. For instance, if x is slightly to the right of y but still to the left of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N: If x is directly above z with x-coordinate overlap.
- NE: If x is to the right and above z.
- NW: If x is to the left and above z.

Actually, let's also consider "E" as a possibility.

For x to be E of z:
- x should be to the right of z, which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- x's y-range should overlap with z's y-range, which means infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z) or infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

But from our constraints, we know x is above z, which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the requirement for E, which is that there should be y-coordinate overlap. Thus, x cannot be E of z.

Actually, let me re-check the definition of the "E" relation to be sure:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

For "x is E of z", this would mean:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z)

But from our constraints:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)

This contradicts the third condition for "x is E of z", which is supy(x) <= supy(z). If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then the top of x cannot be below or at the same level as the top of z.

So, x cannot be E of z.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N: If x is directly above z with x-coordinate overlap.
- NE: If x is to the right and above z.
- NW: If x is to the left and above z.

Actually, let me try to generalize the constraint further to be sure.

Given constraints:
- Region x is E of region y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- Region y is NW of region z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let me try to find the possible relations between x and z, one by one, based on the definitions.

1. B (bounding box): a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
   For x B z, we would need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   From our constraints, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
   If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then supy(x) <= supy(z) cannot be true. Hence, x cannot be B of z.

2. S (south): a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
   For x S z, we would need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   From our constraints, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
   If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then supy(x) <= infy(z) cannot be true. Hence, x cannot be S of z.

3. SW (southwest): a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
   For x SW z, we would need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   From our constraints, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
   If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then supy(x) cannot be below or at the same level as the bottom of z. Hence, x cannot be SW of z.

4. W (west): a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
   For x W z, we would need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   From our constraints, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
   If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then supy(x) <= supy(z) cannot be true. Hence, x cannot be W of z.

5. NW (northwest): a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
   For x NW z, we would need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   From our constraints, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
   So, the second condition is satisfied. But we need to check if supx(x) <= infx(z) can be true given our constraints.
   From "x is E of y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
   From "y is NW of z", we have supx(y) <= infx(z).
   These constraints don't allow us to determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) definitively. They could satisfy supx(x) <= infx(z), or they might not. Hence, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

6. N (north): a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
   For x N z, we would need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   From our constraints, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
   So, the first condition is satisfied. But we need to check if the other two conditions can be true given our constraints.
   The constraints don't determine the relationships between infx(z) and infx(x) or between supx(x) and supx(z) definitively. They could satisfy the conditions, or they might not. Hence, N is a possible relation between x and z.

7. NE (northeast): a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
   For x NE z, we would need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   From our constraints, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
   So, the second condition is satisfied. But we need to check if supx(z) <= infx(x) can be true given our constraints.
   The constraints don't determine the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x) definitively. It could satisfy supx(z) <= infx(x), or it might not. Hence, NE is a possible relation between x and z.

8. E (east): a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
   For x E z, we would need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   From our constraints, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
   If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then supy(x) <= supy(z) cannot be true. Hence, x cannot be E of z.

9. SE (southeast): a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
   For x SE z, we would need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   From our constraints, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
   If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then supy(x) cannot be below or at the same level as the bottom of z (given that a region has a non-zero height). Hence, x cannot be SE of z.

Let me double-check my reasoning:

For x to be NW of z:
- x should be to the left of z, which means supx(x) <= infx(z)
- x should be above z, which means supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which satisfies the second condition. For the first condition, our constraints don't directly determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). It's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, which means NW is a possible relation.

For x to be N of z:
- x should be directly above z with x-coordinate overlap, which means supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which satisfies the first condition. For the other two conditions, our constraints don't directly determine the relationships between infx(z) and infx(x) or between supx(x) and supx(z). It's possible for them to be true, which means N is a possible relation.

For x to be NE of z:
- x should be to the right of z, which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- x should be above z, which means supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which satisfies the second condition. For the first condition, our constraints don't directly determine the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). It's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, which means NE is a possible relation.

Let me also check E. For x to be E of z:
- x should be to the right of z, which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- x's y-range should overlap with z's y-range, which means infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z) or infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) or infy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(x) or infx(x) <= supy(z) <= supy(x)

From our constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement for y-coordinate overlap. Hence, x cannot be E of z.

Actually I think I'm over-complicating this. Let's step back. Here are our constraints:
- Region x is E of region y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- Region y is NW of region z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's derive what we can:
From the first constraint, we learn:
- x is to the right of y
- x and y have some overlap in the y-dimension

From the second constraint, we learn:
- y is to the left of z
- y is above z

Now, I want to find the possible relations between x and z.

From the constraints, I can say:
- x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z. This doesn't directly tell me if x is to the left or right of z.
- x has some overlap with y in the y-dimension, and y is above z. Since y is above z and x overlaps with y in the y-dimension, x is at or above y's bottom, which is above z. This means x is above z.

Given that x is above z, the possible relations are N, NE, and NW. We need to check if these relations are consistent with our constraints.

For x to be N of z:
- x should be directly above z with x-coordinate overlap. Given that x is above z, this is possible.

For x to be NE of z:
- x should be to the right of z and above z. Given that x is above z, this is possible.

For x to be NW of z:
- x should be to the left of z and above z. Given that x is above z, this is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

Actually, let's double-check by logically analyzing the constraints:

We're told that x is E of y and y is NW of z.

From x E y, we have:
- x is to the right of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- x overlaps with y in the y-dimension: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y NW z, we have:
- y is to the left of z: supx(y) <= infx(z)
- y is above z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these:
- x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z. But this doesn't directly tell us if x is to the left or right of z.
- x overlaps with y in the y-dimension, and y is above z. Since supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), we have supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is above z.

Given that x is above z but we're not sure about the x-dimension, x can be N, NE, or NW of z.

Actually, let me also check if E is a possibility.

For x to be E of z:
- x is to the right of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- x overlaps with z in the y-dimension: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement for y-coordinate overlap. Hence, x cannot be E of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW. I'm confident in this answer.

Actually, let me double check. For NW, do we have possible worlds where x is to the left of z and above it? Given that x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z, it seems that x would be to the right of z. But I need to think about it more.

From x is E of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of y.
From y is NW of z, we have supx(y) <= infx(z), which means z is to the right of y.

So, both x and z are to the right of y. But this doesn't tell us the relative position of x and z. x can be to the left of z, to the right of z, or even overlapping with z in the x-dimension.

For NW, x needs to be to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) and above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)). From our constraints, we've already seen that x is above z. But is it possible for x to be to the left of z, given that both x and z are to the right of y?

Yes, it's possible. For instance, if y, x, and z are arranged as follows:
```
   y    x
        z
```
Here, x is to the right of y, z is to the right of y, and x is to the left of z. This scenario is consistent with our constraints.

So, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

Similarly, N and NE are also possible. For N, x would be directly above z with x-coordinate overlap. For NE, x would be to the right of z and above it.

The possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW, and I'm confident in this answer.

Actually, let me scrutinize NW a bit more by following a specific example:

Let's say y's bounding box is (0, 0) to (2, 2), x's bounding box is (3, 1) to (4, 2), and z's bounding box is (3, -1) to (5, -0.5).

In this case, x is E of y:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3
- infy(y) = 0 <= infy(x) = 1
- supy(x) = 2 <= supy(y) = 2

And y is NW of z:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(z) = 3
- supy(z) = -0.5 <= infy(y) = 0

Now, the relation between x and z:
- infx(x) = 3 and infx(z) = 3, supx(x) = 4 and supx(z) = 5. This means x and z have overlap in the x-dimension.
- infy(x) = 1 and supy(z) = -0.5. This means x is above z.

Given the x-coordinate overlap and that x is above z, the relation between x and z is N.

Now, if we adjust z's bounding box to (6, -1) to (7, -0.5), x would be to the left of z and above it, making the relation NW.

If we adjust z's bounding box to (1, -1) to (2, -0.5), x would be to the right of z and above it, making the relation NE.

So, depending on the specific positions of x and z, the relation can be N, NE, or NW.

Wait, I might have misunderstood something. Let me double check the definitions of cardinal direction relations.

A single-tile cardinal direction relation B (bounding box), S (South), SW (South West), W (West), NW (North West), N (North), NE (North East), E (East) and SE (South East) is defined as follows:

B: a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
S: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
SW: a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
W: a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
NW: a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
N: a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
NE: a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
E: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
SE: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

I think these are in line with what I've been reasoning with. Let's continue.

So, given the constraints:
- Region x is E of region y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- Region y is NW of region z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(y)

The possible relations between x and z are:
- N: x is directly above z with x-coordinate overlap.
- NE: x is to the right of z and above z.
- NW: x is to the left of z and above z.

Let's recheck these:

For N, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so the first condition is met. The other conditions can be true for certain positions of x and z, but the constraints don't determine this definitively.

For NE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so the second condition is met. The first condition can be true for certain positions of x and z.

For NW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so the second condition is met. The first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), means x is to the left of z.

Given that x is to the right of y, and z is to the right of y, can x be to the left of z? Let's check.

We have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).

If infx(z) < infx(x), then z starts to the left of x.
If infx(x) < infx(z), then x starts to the left of z.

Neither of these is determined by our constraints. Similarly, for the right edges, if supx(z) < supx(x), then z ends to the left of x. If supx(x) < supx(z), then x ends to the left of z. Again, neither is determined by our constraints.

The only definitive statement we can make is that both x and z are to the right of y. But we can't say which is further to the right based on our constraints.

So, x can be to the left of z, meaning NW is a possible relation.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW. I think I've thoroughly analyzed all possibilities, and I'm confident in this answer.

Actually, I think I may have made a mistake in my understanding of NW. Let's clarify.

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

For "x is NW of z", this would mean:
- The rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z.
- The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x.

Given that x is to the right of y and z is to the right of y, is it possible for x to be to the left of z? Yes, it's entirely possible. Both x and z are to the right of y, but their relative positions to each other aren't constrained by this. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or somewhere in between.

Let's consider a specific example:
Let y be at position (0, 0) with size 1x1.
Let x be at position (2, 0) with size 1x1.
Let z be at position (3, -2) with size 1x1.

In this case, x is to the right of y (E of y), y is to the left and above z (NW of z), and x is to the left of z (but not necessarily NW, as there's also the y-coordinate to consider).

Given that x is to the right of y and z is to the right of y, both x and z are to the right of y. But the constraints don't specify the relationship between x and z in terms of their x-coordinates. Hence, it's possible for x to be to the left of z.

Now, regarding the y-coordinates, we've already seen that x is above z. This is consistent with the second condition for NW, which is supy(z) <= infy(x).

So, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

Wait, let me rethink. For x to be NW of z:
- The x-coordinate of the rightmost point of x is less than or equal to the x-coordinate of the leftmost point of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
- The y-coordinate of the topmost point of z is less than or equal to the y-coordinate of the bottommost point of x: supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints, we've established that x is above z, satisfying the second condition. But for the first condition, we need x to be to the left of z.

Given the constraints:
- x is to the right of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- z is to the right of y: supx(y) <= infx(z)

These tell us that both x and z are to the right of y. But this doesn't specify if x is to the left of z, to the right of z, or somewhere in between. In fact, all of these arrangements are possible.

For x to be to the left of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). This means the rightmost point of x is at or to the left of the leftmost point of z. This arrangement is consistent with both x and z being to the right of y.

So, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

Let's recap my answer.

Given the constraints:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

The possible relations between x and z are:
- N: x is directly above z with x-coordinate overlap.
- NE: x is to the right of z and above z.
- NW: x is to the left of z and above z.

I'm confident in this answer after thorough analysis.

Actually, wait, let me check if there are any other possible relations.

For x to be W of z:
- x is to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
- x overlaps with z in the y-dimension: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement for y-coordinate overlap. Hence, x cannot be W of z.

For x to be E of z:
- x is to the right of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- x overlaps with z in the y-dimension: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement for y-coordinate overlap. Hence, x cannot be E of z.

For x to be SW of z:
- x is to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
- x is below z: supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then x cannot be below z. Hence, x cannot be SW of z.

For x to be S of z:
- x is below z: supy(x) <= infy(z)
- x overlaps with z in the x-dimension: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then x cannot be below z. Hence, x cannot be S of z.

For x to be SE of z:
- x is to the right of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- x is below z: supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then x cannot be below z. Hence, x cannot be SE of z.

For x to be B of z:
- x is contained within z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). If the top of z is below the bottom of x, then supy(x) <= supy(z) cannot be true. Hence, x cannot be B of z.

I've checked all the relations, and the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW. I'm confident in this answer.

Actually, let's directly map to the definitions to be sure.

Constraints:
- x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x.

Now, let's check each relation:

1. B(x, z): For this, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= supy(z) for B. Hence, x cannot be B of z.

2. S(x, z): For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for S. Hence, x cannot be S of z.

3. SW(x, z): For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
   From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for SW. Hence, x cannot be SW of z.

4. W(x, z): For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= supy(z) for W. Hence, x cannot be W of z.

5. NW(x, z): For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
   From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so the second condition is satisfied. The first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), is not determined by our constraints. It can be true for certain positions of x and z. Hence, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

6. N(x, z): For this, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so the first condition is satisfied. The other two conditions are not determined by our constraints. They can be true for certain positions of x and z. Hence, N is a possible relation between x and z.

7. NE(x, z): For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
   From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so the second condition is satisfied. The first condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), is not determined by our constraints. It can be true for certain positions of x and z. Hence, NE is a possible relation between x and z.

8. E(x, z): For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= supy(z) for E. Hence, x cannot be E of z.

9. SE(x, z): For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
   From our constraints, we know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for SE. Hence, x cannot be SE of z.

After checking all relations, the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW. I'm confident in this answer.

Let me double check my reasoning:

For N of z, I need to check:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've established that the first constraint is true. Let's double check whether the others could potentially be true.

From "x is E of y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
From "y is NW of z", we have supx(y) <= infx(z).

These don't tell us directly if infx(z) <= infx(x). It's possible for both infx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) <= infx(z). Similarly, we don't have direct constraints on supx(x) and supx(z).

Given the constraints, it's possible for infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) to be true. Hence, N is a possible relation between x and z.

For NE of z, I need to check:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've established that the second constraint is true. For the first constraint, we don't have direct information from our given constraints. But it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x) to be true. Hence, NE is a possible relation between x and z.

For NW of z, I need to check:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've established that the second constraint is true. Now, is it possible for supx(x) <= infx(z) given our constraints?

From "x is E of y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
From "y is NW of z", we have supx(y) <= infx(z).

These tell us that both infx(x) and infx(z) are to the right of supx(y). But it doesn't directly tell us which is to the right of the other.

Regarding "x is to the right of y" and "z is to the right of y", let's think of a spatial arrangement: First place y, then place both x and z to the right of y. Such an arrangement allows for various relative positions of x and z. x can be to the left of z, to the right of z, or even overlapping with z in the x-dimension.

So, it's possible for x to be to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) given our constraints. Hence, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

Wait, let's be sure about NW for one second. For NW, I need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've established that the second constraint is true given our initial constraints.

For the first constraint, we have:
- x is to the right of y, which means supx(y) <= infx(x)
- z is to the right of y, which means supx(y) <= infx(z)

Visually, we're saying:
```
        <---- supx(y)
                    <---- infx(x)  (from x is E of y)
                    <---- infx(z)  (from y is NW of z)
```

From this, we can't directly infer the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). Also, supx(x) and infx(z) don't have a deterministic relationship.

Let me try a different approach. For NW, supx(x) <= infx(z) means that "x is to the left of z". Is it possible for x to be to the left of z given our constraints?

Our constraints tell us that both x and z are to the right of y, but they don't specify the relative positions of x and z. It's possible for x to be to the left of z, to the right of z, or even overlapping with z in the x-dimension.

So, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

Spatial reasoning can be challenging with pure logic.

Given the constraints:
- x is E of y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(y)

The possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

I'm confident in this after thorough analysis.

So the possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, and NW.

ANSWER:

Looking at the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of x is at or above bottom of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x is at or below top of y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (z is to the right of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

From these constraints, I can determine:
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z
- Both x and z are to the right of y, but their relative horizontal positioning is not constrained

Therefore, the possible relations are:

N, NE, NW
