PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's use the definitions provided to work this out.

We have that region x is S of region y, which means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

We also have that region y is B of region z, which means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's determine what we can say about the relationship between x and z.

First, let's consider the y-coordinates:
We know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

This means supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z). So supy(x) <= infy(z). 

Next, let's consider the x-coordinates:
We know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

This means infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).

We also know:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

This means supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).

So, for the relation between x and z, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (not necessarily)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

Actually, I made a mistake. We can't conclude that infx(z) <= infx(x). We know that infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), but the transitivity doesn't work here because the inequality signs are in the wrong direction. So we don't have a constraint on the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x).

Let's revisit:

We know:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

This means, x could be S of z, or it could be SW of z, or it could be SE of z, depending on the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z), and between supx(x) and infx(z).

Let's consider the possible cases:

Case 1: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
In this case, the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.
Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), this means x S z.

Case 2: infx(x) < infx(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z)
In this case, the x-projection of x is completely to the left of the x-projection of z.
Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), this means x SW z.

Case 3: supx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
In this case, the x-projection of x is completely to the right of the x-projection of z.
Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), this means x SE z.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Let's think about the bounding box of each region. We have:
- Region x: [infx(x), supx(x)] × [infy(x), supy(x)]
- Region y: [infx(y), supx(y)] × [infy(y), supy(y)]
- Region z: [infx(z), supx(z)] × [infy(z), supy(z)]

From the given relations:
- x S y: This means that x is below y, with possibly some x-overlap.
- y B z: This means that y is contained within the bounding box of z.

So, x is below y, and y is inside the bounding box of z. Hence, x must be below the bounding box of z. Depending on the relative x-positions, x can be S, SW, or SE of z.

Actually, let me carefully analyze this again more carefully, taking care of the formal definitions.

We have:
x S y means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

y B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom edge is above or at z's bottom edge)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top edge is below or at z's top edge)

From the above, we can infer:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but we can't establish a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible for supy(x) to be <= infy(z) or for infy(z) < supy(x).

Actually, let's think about this more carefully. We have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

If infy(z) <= supy(x), then we'd have infy(z) <= supy(x) <= infy(y), which is consistent with the constraints. But if supy(x) < infy(z), then we'd have supy(x) < infy(z) <= infy(y), which is also consistent. So we don't have a fixed constraint on the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

This means that x could be at the same y-level as z, below z, or even overlap with z in the y-direction.

Actually, no, I made a mistake in the previous analysis. Let's be careful.

We have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

If supy(x) < infy(z), then supy(x) < infy(z) <= infy(y), which is consistent. But if infy(z) <= supy(x), then we'd have infy(z) <= supy(x) <= infy(y), which requires supy(x) = infy(y) and infy(z) = infy(y) for consistency. This is a very specific case and isn't generally true. So, in general, we can say supy(x) < infy(z), which implies x is below z.

No, I'm still making a mistake. Let's approach it differently.

We have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

These two inequalities don't directly give us a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible for supy(x) to be less than, equal to, or greater than infy(z).

Actually, this gets quite complex. Let's visualize this in a different way. Since the given relations are x S y and y B z, we can think of the possible arrangements where these conditions hold.

If y is in the bounding box of z, and x is S (south) of y, then x can be:
1. S of z: This happens when infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
2. SW of z: This happens when supx(x) <= infx(z).
3. SE of z: This happens when supx(z) <= infx(x).

Let's actually derive this systematically.

We have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

Now, if supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is below z.
But if infy(z) < supy(x), then we'd have infy(z) < supy(x) <= infy(y), which means infy(z) < infy(y). This is consistent with y B z. Thus, it's possible for x to overlap with z in the y-direction.

Actually though, let me think about the implications carefully. If x S y and y B z, then perhaps I can draw a picture to help understand the constraints.

y is inside the bounding box of z. This means the bounding box of z extends beyond the bounding box of y in all directions.

x is south of y, which means x's bounding box is entirely below y's.

So, x is below y, and y is within the bounding box of z. This means x can be:
1. Below z (S of z): If the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.
2. Below and to the left of z (SW of z): If the x-projection of x is to the left of the x-projection of z.
3. Below and to the right of z (SE of z): If the x-projection of x is to the right of the x-projection of z.
4. It's also possible for x to be B of z: If x's bounding box is inside z's bounding box.

Actually, let me try to do this more carefully.

x S y means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

y B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom edge is above or at z's bottom edge)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top edge is below or at z's top edge)

From the constraints above, we have:
1. infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
2. supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
3. supy(x) <= infy(y)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z)

From 1 and 2, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means the x-projection of x can be anywhere from completely inside the x-projection of z to partially overlapping with it.

From 3, 4, and 5, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means the y-projection of x is below the y-projection of y, and the y-projection of y is contained within the y-projection of z. But we don't have a definitive relationship between the y-projections of x and z.

It seems like there are several possibilities for the relation between x and z based on the given constraints:

1. x S z: This would require supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) from the above analysis. However, we don't have a definitive relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). But it's a possibility.

2. x SW z: This would require supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z). We don't have a definitive relationship for either condition from the given constraints. But it's a possibility.

3. x SE z: This would require supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x). We've established supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless supx(x) = supx(z) = infx(x), which is a very specific case). So, in general, x cannot be SE of z.

No, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.

Let's establish what we know for sure from the given conditions:

1. x S y implies:
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

2. y B z implies:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom edge is above or at z's bottom edge)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top edge is below or at z's top edge)

Given these, we can derive the following:

1. For the x-coordinate:
   - From x S y, we have infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - Therefore, infx(z) <= infx(x) (transitive property)

   - From x S y, we have supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - From y B z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - Therefore, supx(x) <= supx(z) (transitive property)

   So, in terms of x-coordinates, the relative position of x to z is: x is either completely inside the x-projection of z, or x lies partially to the right of the left edge of z.

2. For the y-coordinate:
   - From x S y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y)
   - From y B z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - These don't give us a definitive relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) directly.

   However, if we consider the transitive properties:
   - If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is strictly below z.
   - If infy(z) < supy(x), then the y-projection of x overlaps with the y-projection of z.

   Given the nature of the constraints (x S y and y B z), it's reasonable to consider both cases.

Now, let's check for possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. x S z: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Supy(x) <= infy(z) is a possibility. So, x S z is a possible relation.

2. x SW z: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z). We've established supx(x) <= supx(z), but we don't know the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x SW z is a possible relation.

3. x W z: This requires infx(z) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We don't have constraints to ensure supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x W z is a possible relation if some additional constraints are satisfied.

4. x NW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) given the constraints. So, x NW z is not a possible relation.

5. x N z: This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). However, the constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts with the given constraints. So, x N z is not a possible relation.

6. x NE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x NE z is not a possible relation.

7. x E z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x E z is not a possible relation.

8. x SE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x SE z is not a possible relation.

9. x B z: This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), but the other two conditions need to be checked based on the specific arrangements.

Actually, you know what, I realize that I've been making a mistake the whole time. I've been working a S incorrectly, thinking that infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). But according to the definitions:

a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) <= infy(b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)

So, x S y means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

This matches what I have been working with I think, I just had myself confused. Let me ensure I'm using the correct definitions for all relations.

a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is below b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a) (a's left edge is to the right of or at b's left edge)
- supx(a) <= supx(b) (a's right edge is to the left of or at b's right edge)

a SW b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is to the left of b)
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is below b)

a W b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is to the left of b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) (a's bottom edge is above or at b's bottom edge)
- supy(a) <= supy(b) (a's top edge is below or at b's top edge)

a NW b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is to the left of b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is above b)

a N b if and only if:
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is above b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a) (a's left edge is to the right of or at b's left edge)
- supx(a) <= supx(b) (a's right edge is to the left of or at b's right edge)

a NE b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the right of b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is above b)

a E b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the right of b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) (a's bottom edge is above or at b's bottom edge)
- supy(a) <= supy(b) (a's top edge is below or at b's top edge)

a SE b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the right of b)
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is below b)

a B b if and only if:
- infx(b) <= infx(a) (a's left edge is to the right of or at b's left edge)
- supx(a) <= supx(b) (a's right edge is to the left of or at b's right edge)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) (a's bottom edge is above or at b's bottom edge)
- supy(a) <= supy(b) (a's top edge is below or at b's top edge)

Let's go through the possibilities again.

x S y implies:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

y B z implies:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom edge is above or at z's bottom edge)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top edge is below or at z's top edge)

From the above constraints, we have:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but we can't immediately deduce the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It could be supy(x) <= infy(z) or infy(z) < supy(x).
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), so we have infx(z) <= infx(x). This means the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z.
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), so we have supx(x) <= supx(z). This means the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of z.

Now, let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. x S z: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Supy(x) <= infy(z) is a possibility, so x S z is a possible relation.

2. x SW z: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z). We've established supx(x) <= supx(z), but we don't know the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x SW z is a possible relation.

3. x W z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We don't have definitive constraints for the first two conditions, so x W z could be a possible relation under specific arrangements.

4. x NW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Given that x is S of y, and y is B of z, it's hard to establish supy(z) <= infy(x). In fact, given the nature of the constraints, it's more likely that x is below or at a similar y-level as z, not above it. So, x NW z doesn't seem like a reasonable possibility.

5. x N z: This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). However, given that x is S of y and y is contained within the bounding box of z, it's unlikely for x to be N of z. So, x N z doesn't seem like a reasonable possibility.

6. x NE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Given that supx(x) <= supx(z) (from our earlier analysis), it contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x NE z is not a possible relation.

7. x E z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Given that supx(x) <= supx(z) (from our earlier analysis), it contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x E z is not a possible relation.

8. x SE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that supx(x) <= supx(z) (from our earlier analysis), it contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x SE z is not a possible relation.

9. x B z: This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) from our earlier analysis. For the other two conditions, we'd need to check specific arrangements. But x B z could be a possibility.

Actually wait. Let me reason more clearly here. Again.

x S y.
y B z.

Let's reconsider the S region y for more clarity. If x is in the South, S region of y, then it means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is below y's bounding box]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [the left edge of x is to the right of or at y's left edge]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [the right edge of x is to the left of or at y's right edge]

And if y is in the bounding box, B region of z, then it means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [the left edge of y is to the right of or at z's left edge]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [the right edge of y is to the left of or at z's right edge]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [the bottom of y is above or at z's bottom]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [the top of y is below or at z's top]

From these, we know:
- The x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.
- The y-projection of y is contained within the y-projection of z.
- The x-projection of x overlaps with the x-projection of y, with x's left edge being to the right of or at y's left edge, and x's right edge being to the left of or at y's right edge.
- The y-projection of x is below the y-projection of y, with the top of x being below or at the bottom of y.

Now, given that the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z and the x-projection of x and y overlap in the way described, the x-projection of x can have various relationships with the x-projection of z. It could be:
1. Contained within the x-projection of z.
2. Overlap with the x-projection of z in a way that the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z, and the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of z. This is just saying that the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.
3. Overlap with the x-projection of z in a way that the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z. This means x is to the left of z.

Given that the y-projection of y is contained within the y-projection of z and the y-projection of x is below the y-projection of y, the y-projection of x can have various relationships with the y-projection of z:
1. The y-projection of x could be below the y-projection of z.
2. The y-projection of x could overlap with the y-projection of z, but with the top of x still below or at the bottom of y.

Now, we can consider the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. x S z: This would require the x-projection of x to be contained within the x-projection of z, and the y-projection of x to be below the y-projection of z. Given the constraints, this is possible.

2. x SW z: This would require the x-projection of x to be to the left of the x-projection of z, and the y-projection of x to be below the y-projection of z. Given the constraints, this is possible if the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z.

3. x SE z: This would require the x-projection of x to be to the right of the x-projection of z, and the y-projection of x to be below the y-projection of z. Given the constraints, this doesn't seem possible because the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y, and the right edge of y is to the left of or at the right edge of z. This means the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of z, which contradicts the requirement for x to be to the right of z.

Actually, x SE z actually is possible. Let me check. 

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x]
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [x is below z]

We have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [from x S y]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [from y B z]

So, infx(z) <= infx(x). This doesn't contradict supx(z) <= infx(x) if we have supx(z) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). However, this would mean that the x-projection of z has zero or negative width, which doesn't make sense for a region. So, I maintain that x SE z is not possible.

Wait, it could still be possible. If we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [from x S y]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [from y B z]

We get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). So, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). This could be satisfied if supx(z) == infx(x) or supx(z) < infx(x).

Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me draw out the picture.

Imagine x is south of y, and y is contained with the bounding box of z. This means the the left edge of y is to the right of or at the left edge of z, and the right edge of y is to the left of or at the right edge of z.

From x S y, the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y, and the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y. 

Could x be to the right of z? Let's think about it: the left edge of x is to the right of or at left edge of y, which is to the right of or at the left edge of z. So, the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z. For x to be SE of z, the right edge of z would need to be to the left of the left edge of x, meaning supx(z) < infx(x). But we've just established that infx(x) is to the right of or at the left edge of z, meaning infx(z) <= infx(x). This doesn't directly contradict supx(z) < infx(x).

Hmm, I think I'm getting confused by the notation. Let me try to reason this through in a different way.

Imagine we have the x-axis coordinates for our regions. Let's denote the left edge of region a as a_left and the right edge as a_right. Similarly for regions b and c.

If a is S of b, then a is below b, with b_left <= a_left and a_right <= b_right. If b is B of c, then b is inside c's bounding box, meaning c_left <= b_left, b_right <= c_right, c_bottom <= b_bottom, and b_top <= c_top.

Now, if a is below b and b is inside c's bounding box, then a could be below c (a is S of c), to the left and below c (a is SW of c), or to the right and below c (a is SE of c). For a to be SE of c, we'd need the right edge of c to be to the left of the left edge of a (c_right < a_left). But from a is S of b and b is B of c, we have c_left <= b_left <= a_left and a_right <= b_right <= c_right. This means a_left is to the right of or at the left edge of c, and a_right is to the left of or at the right edge of c. This contradicts the condition for a SE c (c_right < a_left). So, a can't be SE of c.

Actually, I'm getting confusing notation. Let me set up specific example with specific values. Imagine we have regions with coordinates as follows:
- a = x = [4, 6] × [1, 2] (So infx(a) = 4, supx(a) = 6, infy(a) = 1, supy(a) = 2)
- b = y = [3, 7] × [3, 5] (So infx(b) = 3, supx(b) = 7, infy(b) = 3, supy(b) = 5)
- c = z = [2, 8] × [2, 6] (So infx(c) = 2, supx(c) = 8, infy(c) = 2, supy(c) = 6)

Let's check if a S b:
- supy(a) <= infy(b)? 2 <= 3, Yes.
- infx(b) <= infx(a)? 3 <= 4, Yes.
- supx(a) <= supx(b)? 6 <= 7, Yes.
So, a S b is satisfied.

Let's check if b B c:
- infx(c) <= infx(b)? 2 <= 3, Yes.
- supx(b) <= supx(c)? 7 <= 8, Yes.
- infy(c) <= infy(b)? 2 <= 3, Yes.
- supy(b) <= supy(c)? 5 <= 6, Yes.
So, b B c is satisfied.

Now, let's check the possible relationships between a and c:

Is a S c?
- supy(a) <= infy(c)? 2 <= 2, Yes.
- infx(c) <= infx(a)? 2 <= 4, Yes.
- supx(a) <= supx(c)? 6 <= 8, Yes.
So, a S c can be satisfied.

Is a SW c?
- supy(a) <= infy(c)? 2 <= 2, Yes.
- supx(a) <= infx(c)? 6 <= 2, No.
So, a SW c is not satisfied in this example.

Is a B c?
- infx(c) <= infx(a)? 2 <= 4, Yes.
- supx(a) <= supx(c)? 6 <= 8, Yes.
- infy(c) <= infy(a)? 2 <= 1, No.
So, a B c is not satisfied in this example.

In this example, we found that a is S of c.

Let me try another example to test if a could be SW of c:
- a = x = [1, 2] × [1, 2] (So infx(a) = 1, supx(a) = 2, infy(a) = 1, supy(a) = 2)
- b = y = [2, 3] × [3, 5] (So infx(b) = 2, supx(b) = 3, infy(b) = 3, supy(b) = 5)
- c = z = [3, 4] × [2, 6] (So infx(c) = 3, supx(c) = 4, infy(c) = 2, supy(c) = 6)

Let's check if a S b:
- supy(a) <= infy(b)? 2 <= 3, Yes.
- infx(b) <= infx(a)? 2 <= 1, No. Oops.

Let me correct that. For a S b, we need infx(b) <= infx(a), but in my example, infx(b) = 2 and infx(a) = 1, so 2 <= 1 is not satisfied. Let me adjust:
- a = x = [2, 2.5] × [1, 2] (So infx(a) = 2, supx(a) = 2.5, infy(a) = 1, supy(a) = 2)
- b = y = [2, 3] × [3, 5] (So infx(b) = 2, supx(b) = 3, infy(b) = 3, supy(b) = 5)
- c = z = [1, 4] × [2, 6] (So infx(c) = 1, supx(c) = 4, infy(c) = 2, supy(c) = 6)

Let's check if a S b:
- supy(a) <= infy(b)? 2 <= 3, Yes.
- infx(b) <= infx(a)? 2 <= 2, Yes.
- supx(a) <= supx(b)? 2.5 <= 3, Yes.
So, a S b is satisfied.

Let's check if b B c:
- infx(c) <= infx(b)? 1 <= 2, Yes.
- supx(b) <= supx(c)? 3 <= 4, Yes.
- infy(c) <= infy(b)? 2 <= 3, Yes.
- supy(b) <= supy(c)? 5 <= 6, Yes.
So, b B c is satisfied.

Now, let's check if a SW c:
- supy(a) <= infy(c)? 2 <= 2, Yes.
- supx(a) <= infx(c)? 2.5 <= 1, No.

I made a mistake. For SW, I need supx(a) <= infx(c). But 2.5 <= 1 is not satisfied. Let me adjust the example again.

- a = x = [0, 0.5] × [1, 2] (So infx(a) = 0, supx(a) = 0.5, infy(a) = 1, supy(a) = 2)
- b = y = [0, 3] × [3, 5] (So infx(b) = 0, supx(b) = 3, infy(b) = 3, supy(b) = 5)
- c = z = [1, 4] × [2, 6] (So infx(c) = 1, supx(c) = 4, infy(c) = 2, supy(c) = 6)

Wait, I'm making a mistake. For a S b, we need infx(b) <= infx(a), which means a starts to the right of b. But then using trasitivity, we'd get infx(c) <= infx(b) <= infx(a), which means a starts to the right of c. This contradicts a being SW of c, which would require a to be to the left of c.

I'm confused. Let's go back to definition:

a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) <= infy(b) [a is below b]
- infx(b) <= infx(a) [the left edge of a is to the right of or at the left edge of b]
- supx(a) <= supx(b) [the right edge of a is to the left of or at the right edge of b]

So, for x S y, we'd have infx(y) <= infx(x), which means the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y. And for y B z, we'd have infx(z) <= infx(y), which means the left edge of y is to the right of or at the left edge of z. Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z), which means the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z. But we just established infx(z) <= infx(x), which means the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z. If the left edge of x is to the right of the left edge of z, then the right edge of x (which is further to the right) cannot be to the left of the left edge of z. This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).

Therefore, x cannot be SW of z.

With a similar logic for SE: For x to be SE of z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), which means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. But we also have supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z), giving supx(x) <= supx(z). This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). Therefore, x cannot be SE of z.

Alright, so x can be S of z. Can x be B of z?

For x B z, we'd need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) [the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z]
- supx(x) <= supx(z) [the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) [the bottom of x is above or at the bottom of z]
- supy(x) <= supy(z) [the top of x is below or at the top of z]

We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) from our earlier analysis. For the other conditions, we'd need to check specific arrangements.

From x S y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y). From y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). So, infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), giving supy(x) <= supy(z). But we still don't have a definitive relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).

If infy(z) <= infy(x), then x can be B of z. But if infy(x) < infy(z), then x would be below z, making it S of z.

So, depending on the specific arrangements, x can be either S of z or B of z.

Actually, hold on, let's revisit the S relation. For x S y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y), which means the top of x is below or at the bottom of y. This means x and y don't overlap in the y-direction. For x to be B of z, we'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which means the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z. If x and y don't overlap in the y-direction and y is contained within the bounding box of z, it's hard to see how x can be within the bounding box of z.

Let me think about this geometrically:

y is inside the bounding box of z. This means the bounding box of z extends beyond the bounding box of y in all directions, or coincides with it in some.

x is south of y, which means x is below y with no overlap in the y-direction. The left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y, and the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y.

Given these constraints, x is outside the bounding box of y in the y-direction, being below it. For x to be inside the bounding box of z, the bottom edge of z would have to be below the bottom edge of y, and in fact, below the bottom edge of x. While this isn't impossible given the constraints y B z (which only says that the bottom of y is above or at the bottom of z), it would require a specific arrangement where z's bottom edge extends well below y's.

But actually, being more precise from y B z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means the y-projection of y is contained within the y-projection of z. From x S y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y), which means the top of x is below or at the bottom of y. Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z). But for x to be B of z, we'd also need infy(z) <= infy(x). From the constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't have a direct relationship between infy(y) and infy(x), so we can't determine whether infy(z) <= infy(x).

So, it's possible for x to be B of z if infy(z) <= infy(x), but not that all arrangements that satisfy the constraints will have this property.

So far we have that x could be S z or x could be B z, assuming that some other relationships also hold. But these aren't guaranteed just from the constraints. Let's check W.

For x W z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) [x is to the left of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) [the bottom of x is above or at the bottom of z]
- supy(x) <= supy(z) [the top of x is below or at the top of z]

We've established infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) from the constraints, which means the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z. This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (unless supx(x) = infx(x) = infx(z), which is a very specific case). So, in general, x W z is not a possible relation. Same logic for x NW z, x N z, x NE z, and x E z.

So our final list should be that the possible directions are:

x S z
x B z

Let me double-check that I'm not missing anything:
1. x S z: Possible, as we've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z) can be satisfied in some arrangements.
2. x SW z: Not possible, as we've shown a contradiction in the x-direction, where infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z) would require infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z), which is a very specific case and not a general possibility.
3. x W z: Not possible, for a similar reason as x SW z.
4. x NW z: Not possible, for reasons similar to x W z.
5. x N z: Not possible, as x is south of y, which is contained within the bounding box of z, making it unlikely for x to be north of z.
6. x NE z: Not possible, for reasons similar to x E z.
7. x E z: Not possible, as we have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (a requirement for x E z).
8. x SE z: Not possible, for a similar reason as x E z.
9. x B z: Possible, but only in some specific arrangements where infy(z) <= infy(x), and not guaranteed for all arrangements that satisfy the constraints.

Actually, I think I can simplify this whole reasoning by taking more of a schematic approach, and just thinking about the images I would draw.

If y is in the Bounding box of z, then we can say that z bounds, or fully contains, y. If x is South of y, then x is below y. So what are the possible relationships between x and z? Since z fully bounds y, and x is below y, there's 2 places for x relative to z:
1. x is outside the bounding box of z, and below it. This would make x S z.
2. x is inside the bounding box of z, still below y, but still inside z's boundaries. Then x is B z.

So the possible relations are x S z and x B z.

Actually wait, I think I need to be more precise about the bounding box. The bounding box B does not mean "fully contains." It means the region is inside the minimum bounding box. So the region y can be at the bottom of the region z, for example. And in that case, the region x can be below the region z.

I think another common mistake I made is to assume that South means "bounding boxes don't overlap." South does not mean there's a gap between the bounding boxes. It means one bounding box is below the other, but they can actually touch.

Given these corrections, let me re-analyze the situation:

If y is in the Bounding box (B) of z, it means the bounding box of y is contained within the bounding box of z. If x is South (S) of y, it means the bounding box of x is below the bounding box of y, with potentially some overlap in the x-direction.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. x could be S of z: This would mean the bounding box of x is below the bounding box of z. Given that y is within the bounding box of z and x is below y, this is a possibility.
2. x could be B of z: This would mean the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of z. This would be the case if, for example, z extends lower than y, and x's bounding box is entirely within z's.

Wait a moment. Let me try to be more clear. We're given the constraints x S y and y B z.

From x S y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y), which means the top of x is below or at the bottom of y. The left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y, and the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y.

From y B z, we have the bounding box of y contained within the bounding box of z. This means the left edge of y is to the right of or at the left edge of z, and the right edge of y is to the left of or at the right edge of z. The bottom of y is above or at the bottom of z, and the top of y is below or at the top of z.

Given these, we can say:
- The left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y, which is in turn to the right of or at the left edge of z. So, the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z.
- The right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y, which is in turn to the left of or at the right edge of z. So, the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of z.
- The top of x is below or at the bottom of y.

Now, the relationship between x and z depends on the position of the bottom of z:
- If the bottom of z is below the bottom of x, then the bounding box of x would be contained within the bounding box of z, making x B z.
- If the bottom of z is above the bottom of x, then the bounding box of x would be partially below the bounding box of z, making x S z.

So, the possible relations are x S z and x B z, depending on the specific positions of the regions.

Actually, I've talked myself in a circle. Let me reason about this in a different way. In my schematic, I visualize the bounding box of y inside teh bounding box of z. This relationship implies that infy(z) <= infy(y), i.e., the bottom of y is above or at the bottom of z. Maybe the bounding box of y extends to the bottom of the bounding box of z, but it's possible that infy(z) < infy(y).

From x S y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y), which means the top of x is below or at the bottom of y. Combined with the above, we don't have a precise relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), or between supy(x) and infy(z).

If the top of x is below the bottom of z, then x S z. But if the top of x is at or above the bottom of z, then x could be B z, S z, or even SW z or SE z, depending on the x-coordinates.

Actually, wait, there's another constraint from the definitions of S and B. For x S y, the x-projection of x overlaps with the x-projection of y in a certain way: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).

Combining this with y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). This means the x-projection of x overlaps with or is contained within the x-projection of z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

This rules out x SW z (which requires supx(x) <= infx(z)) and x SE z (which requires supx(z) <= infx(x)), as well as many other relations like x W z, x NW z, x N z, x NE z, and x E z, which similarly place x outside or partial overlapping with the x-projection of z.

Ok, I've now convinced myself, we have 2 possibilities:
- x S z: This would be the case if the top of x is below the bottom of z.
- x B z: This would be the case if the top of x is at or above the bottom of z, and the bottom of x is below the bottom of y but not below the bottom of z.

Actually, I'm still not clear, so let me try another approach. Let's visualize with some diagrams:

x S y means x is south of y. Imagine y as a region and x as a region below it. The x-projections overlaps with the x-projection of y, with the left edge of x to the right (or equal) to the left edge of y, and the right edge of x to the left (or equal) to the right edge of y.

y B z means y is contained within the bounding box of z. This means the bounding box of z extends beyond the bounding box of y in all directions (or coincides with it in some).

Now, given x S y (x is south of y) and y B z (y is contained within the bounding box of z), what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

I think that x can be S of z if the bottom edge of z is equal to the bottom edge of y, which means the top edge of x is below or equal to the bottom edge of z.

But if the bottom edge of z is below the bottom edge of y, and specifically, if the bottom edge of z is below the bottom edge of x, then x would be B of z (contained within the bounding box of z).

So, the possible relations are x S z or x B z, depending on the specific positioning of the regions.

Wait a moment. Let me be super explicit about checking all possible directions.

From the given constraints x S y and y B z, we can derive the following:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is below y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [the left edge of y is to the right of or at the left edge of z]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [the right edge of y is to the left of or at the right edge of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [the bottom of y is above or at the bottom of z]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [the top of y is below or at the top of z]

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) implies infx(z) <= infx(x) [the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) implies supx(x) <= supx(z) [the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of z]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). 

Now, let's check every possible cardinal direction relation:

1. x S z: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x S z holds. This is possible.

2. x SW z: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z). We've established supx(x) <= supx(z). For supx(x) <= infx(z), we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which implies supx(x) <= infx(x). For a region, the left edge (inf_x) is less than or equal to the right edge (sup_x). If we have supx(x) == infx(x), that's a degenerate case (x is a single line). If we have supx(x) < infx(x), that's not valid. Because we require the regions to be proper, x SW z is not a valid configuration.

3. x W z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). For the same reason as x SW z, this is not valid.

4. x NW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). For the same reason as x SW z, this is not valid.

5. x N z: This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). For supy(z) <= infy(x), we'd need supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). But given that x S y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y), which implies infy(x) < infy(y). So, supy(z) <= infy(x) seems contradictory with the constraints. Therefore, x N z is not valid.

6. x NE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). For supx(z) <= infx(x), we'd need supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which implies infx(x) <= supx(x). This is trivially satisfied for regions, but given the transitive property, we'd have supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which implies supx(z) == infx(x) == supx(x). This is a degenerate case where x and z are both reduced to a single vertical line. In general, x NE z is not valid.

7. x E z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). For the same reason as x NE z, this is not valid.

8. x SE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). For the same reason as x NE z, this is not valid.

9. x B z: This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x B z holds. This is possible given our constraints.

So, the valid cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- x S z (if supy(x) <= infy(z))
- x B z (if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))

Actually, I think that we need to be super careful about the constraints.

x S y means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

In short, x's bounding box is below y's bounding box in the y-direction, and the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of y.

y B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

In short, y's bounding box is within z's bounding box.

With these, we can deduce:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z.
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of z.
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y),
