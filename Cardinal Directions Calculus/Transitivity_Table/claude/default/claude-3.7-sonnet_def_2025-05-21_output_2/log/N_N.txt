PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

The question is asking about the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that:
1. Region x is N (North) of region y
2. Region y is N (North) of region z

Let me analyze what it means for region x to be N of region y:
- x N y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

Similarly, for region y to be N of region z:
- y N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, which means I need to determine which of the 9 relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) could hold between x and z.

Let's analyze this step by step:

From x N y, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y N z, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's attempt to derive the constraints on x and z:

Regarding y-coordinates:
- From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y), we can derive supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
- This means supy(z) <= infy(x), which is consistent with relations: N, NE, NW

Regarding x-coordinates:
- From infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which doesn't eliminate any of N, NE, NW

- From supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we get supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- This means supx(x) <= supx(z), which doesn't eliminate any of N, NE, NW

So based on these constraints, we have:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (consistent with N, NE, NW)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (doesn't eliminate any of N, NE, NW)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (doesn't eliminate any of N, NE, NW)

Let's check each of N, NE, NW to see if they're possible:

For N:
- We need supy(z) <= infy(x), which we have
- We need infx(z) <= infx(x), which we have
- We need supx(x) <= supx(z), which we have

So N is a possible relation between x and z.

For NE:
- We need supy(z) <= infy(x), which we have
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x), which is not implied by our constraints
  In fact, we know supx(x) <= supx(z), which means NE is only possible if supx(x) = supx(z) and this equality point is also = infx(x)
  This is a very specific case and might not be considered in general.

For NW:
- We need supy(z) <= infy(x), which we have
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z), which is not implied and might contradict our constraints
  We know infx(z) <= infx(x), which means NW is only possible if infx(z) = infx(x)
  Again, this is a very specific case.

Hmm, let me rethink this. I need to be more precise. Let's analyze the possible relations by considering the relative positions of the bounding boxes.

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is vertically above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (y extends at least as far left as x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (y extends at least as far right as x)

From y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is vertically above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends at least as far left as y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as y)

Now, for the relation between x and z:

Regarding vertical positioning:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
- This means supy(z) <= infy(x), which ensures x is above z
- This is consistent with N, NE, NW

Regarding horizontal positioning:
1. The left boundary:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - This means infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - This allows for several possibilities: N, NE (if infx(z) = infx(x)), and potentially others

2. The right boundary:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - This means supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - This allows for several possibilities: N, NW (if supx(x) = supx(z)), and potentially others

Let's check each relation:

For N(x, z):
- We need supy(z) <= infy(x), which we have
- We need infx(z) <= infx(x), which we have
- We need supx(x) <= supx(z), which we have
So N is a possible relation.

For NE(x, z):
- We need supy(z) <= infy(x), which we have
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x)
  - From our constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - For NE to be possible, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) unless x is a degenerate case (a vertical line). So, generally, NE is not a possible relation.

For NW(x, z):
- We need supy(z) <= infy(x), which we have
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z)
  - From our constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - For NW to be possible, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) unless x is a degenerate case (a vertical line). So, generally, NW is not a possible relation.

For B(x, z):
- We need infx(z) <= infx(x), which we have
- We need supx(x) <= supx(z), which we have
- We need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
  - However, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z) unless x and z are disjoint in the y-direction. So B is not a possible relation.

Let me continue checking the remaining relations:

For E(x, z):
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x)
  - This contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) unless x is a degenerate case. So E is not a possible relation.

For W(x, z):
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z)
  - This contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) unless x is a degenerate case. So W is not a possible relation.

For S(x, z):
- We need supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - This contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) unless x and z are disjoint in the y-direction. So S is not a possible relation.

For SE(x, z):
- We need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x)
  - Both of these contradict our derived constraints. So SE is not a possible relation.

For SW(x, z):
- We need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z)
  - Both of these contradict our derived constraints. So SW is not a possible relation.

Let me reconsider my approach, as I'm unsure about the validity of these analyses. Let's actually try to visualize the regions to understand the geometry better.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is N of region z

This means:
- x is above y
- y is above z

In a simplified manner, this places x at the top, y in the middle, and z at the bottom. 

Now, when considering the possible relations between x and z, we know that x is above z because x is above y and y is above z. This immediately suggests N as a possible relation.

However, we need to consider the horizontal overlap as well. 

Let's say:
- y is centered (horizontally) below x
- z is to the right of where y is

In this case, x might be to the NW of z.

Let's try another setup:
- y is centered (horizontally) below x
- z is to the left of where y is

In this case, x might be to the NE of z.

So, it seems like N, NE, and NW are the possible relations between x and z.

However, I need to check this more formally to be confident.

Let's think about the constraints from the definitions:

For N:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): We've shown this holds.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): These constraints are on the horizontal overlap. If z is much wider than x, then x can still be N of z. But if z is narrower or shifted, then x might be NE or NW of z.

For NE:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): We've shown this holds.
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This means z is completely to the left of x horizontally. This can happen if z is shifted left compared to y.

For NW:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): We've shown this holds.
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This means x is completely to the left of z horizontally. This can happen if z is shifted right compared to y.

Let's approach this more systematically:

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y N z, we have:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

For the relation between x and z, we've established supy(z) <= infy(x), which is consistent with x being in the N, NE, or NW direction of z.

For N:
- We need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). 
- From our constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
- But we also know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
- Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
- Thus, both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are satisfied, making N a possible relation.

For NE:
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x).
- From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= supx(z) and infx(y) <= infx(x).
- However, these don't determine the relation between supx(z) and infx(x). If z is sufficiently shifted to the left, then NE is possible. Otherwise, it's not.

For NW:
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z).
- From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= supx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
- However, these don't determine the relation between supx(x) and infx(z). If z is sufficiently shifted to the right, then NW is possible. Otherwise, it's not.

Given these analyses, it seems like N is always a possible relation between x and z, while NE and NW might be possible depending on the specific configurations of the regions.

Actually, on second thought:

For NE to be possible, we need supx(z) <= infx(x).
From our constraints, we know supx(y) <= supx(z) and infx(y) <= infx(x).
If y and z have the same horizontal extents and y and x have the same horizontal extents, but z is shifted far to the left, then supx(z) could be less than infx(x), making NE a possible relation.

For NW to be possible, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= supx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
If y and x have the same horizontal extents and y and z have the same horizontal extents, but z is shifted far to the right, then supx(x) could be less than infx(z), making NW a possible relation.

Ok, so N, NE, and NW are all possible relations between x and z, depending on the specific configurations of the regions.

Hmm, I'm still not fully convinced about NE and NW. Let's think more carefully.

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (this means the left boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (this means the right boundary of x is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (this means the left boundary of z is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (this means the right boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of z)

For NE to be possible, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). This means the right boundary of z is to the left of the left boundary of x. 

Let's see if we can construct a scenario where this holds. 
Given our constraints:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- We don't have direct constraints on supx(z) and infx(x).

It seems possible that if z is shifted far to the left and x is shifted far to the right, then supx(z) might be to the left of infx(x), making NE a possible relation.

For NW to be possible, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). This means the right boundary of x is to the left of the left boundary of z.

Given our constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- We don't have direct constraints on supx(x) and infx(z).

It seems possible that if x is shifted far to the left and z is shifted far to the right, then supx(x) might be to the left of infx(z), making NW a possible relation.

Actually, let's build some concrete examples to verify:

Example for NE:
Let's say:
- Region y has boundaries: [1, 3] on the x-axis, [1, 3] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so it has boundaries: [2, 2.5] on the x-axis, [4, 6] on the y-axis. (Note that infx(y) <= infx(x) means 1 <= 2, and supx(x) <= supx(y) means 2.5 <= 3, which hold)
- Region z is S of y, so it has boundaries: [0, 0.5] on the x-axis, [0, 0.5] on the y-axis. (Note that infx(z) <= infx(y) means 0 <= 1, and supx(y) <= supx(z) means 3 <= 0.5, which contradicts)

Hmm, that doesn't work.

Let's try again for NE:
Let's say:
- Region y has boundaries: [1, 3] on the x-axis, [1, 3] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so it has boundaries: [2, 2.5] on the x-axis, [4, 6] on the y-axis. (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))
- Region z is S of y, so it has boundaries: [0, 0.5] on the x-axis, [-1, 0] on the y-axis. (This satisfies supy(z) <= infy(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y))

But we also need supx(y) <= supx(z), which means 3 <= 0.5, which is a contradiction.

Let me try a different approach. Given the conditions:
- x N y
- y N z

We have the constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

For N(x, z), we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (Satisfied by transitivity)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (Satisfied by transitivity)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (Satisfied by transitivity)

So N is always a valid relation.

For NE(x, z), we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (Satisfied by transitivity)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

For the last condition, we have:
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)

It's not clear from these if supx(z) <= infx(x). However, it's possible that z is shifted far to the left (but still with supx(y) <= supx(z)) and x is shifted far to the right (but still with infx(y) <= infx(x)), such that supx(z) <= infx(x).

Let's set up a scenario:
- y has boundaries [2, 3] on the x-axis, [2, 3] on the y-axis.
- x (which is N of y) has boundaries [2.5, 3.5] on the x-axis, [4, 5] on the y-axis. (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x) means 2 <= 2.5, and supx(x) <= supx(y) means 3.5 <= 3, which is a contradiction).

Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here. Let's try again:

For x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (y is below x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right boundary of x is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of y)

This means that x is above y, but horizontally, x is contained within the projection of y onto the x-axis.

For y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of z is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of z)

This means that y is above z, but horizontally, y is contained within the projection of z onto the x-axis.

Given these, x is above z (by transitivity), and horizontally, x's projection onto the x-axis might overlap with z's projection, or it might not.

Let's consider some scenarios:

Scenario 1: x, y, and z all have the same horizontal projection.
In this case, x N z is the relation.

Scenario 2: x is shifted to the right of z, such that there's no horizontal overlap.
For this to happen:
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x) (for NE)
- From x N y, we know infx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y N z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z)
- Combining, we get infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- But this doesn't determine the relation between supx(z) and infx(x)
- It's possible that z is shifted far enough to the right such that supx(z) <= infx(x), making NE a possible relation.

Scenario 3: x is shifted to the left of z, such that there's no horizontal overlap.
For this to happen:
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z) (for NW)
- From x N y, we know supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y N z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y)
- Combining, we get supx(x) <= supx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
- But this doesn't determine the relation between supx(x) and infx(z)
- It's possible that z is shifted far enough to the right such that supx(x) <= infx(z), making NW a possible relation.

Alright, so I believe N, NE, and NW are possible relations between x and z. Let me try to construct specific examples to verify.

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 4] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [3, 4] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis. (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x) means 2 <= 3, and supx(x) <= supx(y) means 4 <= 4, which is fine)
- Region z is S of y, so z has boundaries: [0, 2] on the x-axis, [-1, 1] on the y-axis. (This satisfies infx(z) <= infx(y) means 0 <= 2, and supx(y) <= supx(z) means 4 <= 2, which is a contradiction)

Hmm, still not working.

Wait, I believe there's a confusion in my interpretation. Let's clarify:

For single-tile cardinal direction relation S:
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

This means a is to the south of b, but horizontally, a's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of b onto the x-axis.

For y N z, it means y is to the north of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of z is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of z)

OK so if we have:
y N z, it means z is to the south of y, but horizontally, y's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z onto the x-axis.

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 4] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [3, 3.5] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis. (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x) means 2 <= 3, and supx(x) <= supx(y) means 3.5 <= 4, which is fine)
- Region z is S of y, so z has boundaries: [1, 5] on the x-axis, [-1, 1] on the y-axis. (This satisfies supy(z) <= infy(y) means 1 <= 2, infx(z) <= infx(y) means 1 <= 2, and supx(y) <= supx(z) means 4 <= 5, which is fine)

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)? 1 <= 5, so this is satisfied. Consistent with N, NE, NW.
- infx(z) <= infx(x)? 1 <= 3, so this is satisfied. Consistent with N, but not NE.
- supx(x) <= supx(z)? 3.5 <= 5, so this is satisfied. Consistent with N, but not NW.
- supx(z) <= infx(x)? 5 <= 3, which is not satisfied. So NE is not consistent.
- supx(x) <= infx(z)? 3.5 <= 1, which is not satisfied. So NW is not consistent.

So, in this example, x N z is the relation, but not x NE z or x NW z.

Let me try to construct an example where x NE z is the relation.

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 4] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [3, 3.5] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis. (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))
- Region z has to be such that y N z, so z has to have boundaries: [a, b] on the x-axis, [c, d] on the y-axis, such that d <= 2 (z is below y), a <= 2 (the left boundary of z is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of y), and 4 <= b (the right boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of z).
- Additionally, for x NE z, we need c <= 5 (z is below x), 3 >= b (z is to the left of x), which means b <= 3.

But we also need 4 <= b from y N z. So, b needs to satisfy both 4 <= b and b <= 3, which is a contradiction.

It seems like x NE z is not a valid relation.

Let me try to construct an example where x NW z is the relation.

Example for NW:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 4] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [3, 3.5] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis. (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))
- Region z has to be such that y N z, so z has to have boundaries: [a, b] on the x-axis, [c, d] on the y-axis, such that d <= 2 (z is below y), a <= 2 (the left boundary of z is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of y), and 4 <= b (the right boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of z).
- Additionally, for x NW z, we need c <= 5 (z is below x), 3.5 <= a (z is to the right of x), which means a >= 3.5.

But we also need a <= 2 from y N z. So, a needs to satisfy both a <= 2 and a >= 3.5, which is a contradiction.

It seems like x NW z is also not a valid relation.

Hmm, let's try again more carefully.

We start from the constraints established:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (y is below x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right boundary of x is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of y)

These are met as long as, horizontally, x's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of y onto the x-axis, and vertically, y's upper boundary is below or at the same level as x's lower boundary.

Similarly, for y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of z is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of z)

These are met as long as, horizontally, y's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z onto the x-axis, and vertically, z's upper boundary is below or at the same level as y's lower boundary.

Given these, by transitivity, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which is consistent with N, NE, and NW. But we need to check the horizontal constraints for these relations.

For N, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From our constraints:
infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
Transitively, infx(z) <= infx(x), which is the first condition for N.

Also:
supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)
supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)
Transitively, supx(x) <= supx(z), which is the second condition for N.

So, N is a valid relation.

For NE, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is satisfied by transitivity) and supx(z) <= infx(x).

From our constraints:
supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)
infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
These don't directly tell us about the relation between supx(z) and infx(x). 

Let's think about it graphically: If z is very wide (its projection on the x-axis extends far to the left and right of y's projection), and x is shifted far to the right (while still being within the horizontal projection of y), it's possible that supx(z) is to the left of infx(x). If this is the case, then x NE z is a possible relation.

Similarly, for NW, if z is very wide and x is shifted far to the left (while still being within the horizontal projection of y), it's possible that supx(x) is to the left of infx(z), making x NW z a possible relation.

Actually, I realize the problem with my earlier examples: I was trying to construct a relation where x NE z or x NW z is true, but I was considering examples where y's projection onto the x-axis contained x's projection, which is a very constrained case.

Let's try again with a more general case:

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 4] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [3, 3.5] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis. (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))
- Region z has to be such that y N z. Let's say z has boundaries: [0, 5] on the x-axis, [-1, 1] on the y-axis. This satisfies supy(z) <= infy(y) (1 <= 2), infx(z) <= infx(y) (0 <= 2), and supx(y) <= supx(z) (4 <= 5).

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)? 1 <= 5, so this is satisfied. Consistent with N, NE, NW.
- infx(z) <= infx(x)? 0 <= 3, so this is satisfied. Consistent with N, but not NE.
- supx(x) <= supx(z)? 3.5 <= 5, so this is satisfied. Consistent with N, but not NW.
- supx(z) <= infx(x)? 5 <= 3, which is not satisfied. So NE is not consistent.
- supx(x) <= infx(z)? 3.5 <= 0, which is not satisfied. So NW is not consistent.

OK so for this specific z, it does seem like the relation is N. However, let me try a different z:

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 4] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [3, 3.5] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis. (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))
- Region z, such that y N z, has boundaries: [0, 2.5] on the x-axis, [-1, 1] on the y-axis. This satisfies supy(z) <= infy(y) (1 <= 2), infx(z) <= infx(y) (0 <= 2), and supx(y) <= supx(z) is 4 <= 2.5, which is a contradiction.

Ah, there's my error. For y N z, we need supx(y) <= supx(z). I was thinking earlier that y's projection onto the x-axis should be contained within z's projection, but that's not correct. What we need is:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of z is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of z)

Let's revisit the definition. y N z means y is north of z, which means z is south of y. This means:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is vertically below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(y) (horizontally, z's projection is contained within y's projection)

Wait, no, that's incorrect. The definition provided gives the constraint for a N b, not a S b. So, y N z means:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of z is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of z)

I think my confusion stemmed from my understanding of the constraints.

For y N z, we want:
- z is below y.
- Horizontally, y's left boundary is to the right of or at the same position as z's left boundary (or conversely: z's left boundary is to the left of or aligned with y's left boundary).
- Horizontally, y's right boundary is to the left of or at the same position as z's right boundary (or conversely: z's right boundary is to the right of or aligned with y's right boundary).

Essentially, y's horizontal projection is contained within the horizontal projection of z.

Let me retry:

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 4] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [3, 3.5] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis. (This satisfies y being below x, and x's horizontal projection being contained within y's horizontal projection)
- Region z, such that y N z, has boundaries: [1, 6] on the x-axis, [-1, 1] on the y-axis. This satisfies z being below y, and y's horizontal projection being contained within z's horizontal projection.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)? 1 <= 5, so z is below x.
- infx(z) <= infx(x)? 1 <= 3, so this is satisfied. Consistent with N, but not NE.
- supx(x) <= supx(z)? 3.5 <= 6, so this is satisfied. Consistent with N, but not NW.
- supx(z) <= infx(x)? 6 <= 3, which is not satisfied. So NE is not consistent.
- supx(x) <= infx(z)? 3.5 <= 1, which is not satisfied. So NW is not consistent.

However, I believe this is because z's horizontal projection extends too far to the right.

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 4] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [3, 3.5] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis.
- Region z, such that y N z, has boundaries: [1, 2.5] on the x-axis, [-1, 1] on the y-axis. This doesn't satisfy y N z, because supx(y) <= supx(z) would mean 4 <= 2.5, which is a contradiction.

Hmm, I see the logical problem. Since y's horizontal projection needs to be contained within z's horizontal projection for y N z, and x's horizontal projection needs to be contained within y's horizontal projection for x N y, by transitivity, x's horizontal projection is contained within z's horizontal projection. This would mean x is always N of z, and not NE or NW.

Actually, I think I misstated the single-tile cardinal direction relation S (and hence N).

Let's revisit the definition:
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

This means a is to the south of b, but horizontally, a's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of b onto the x-axis. Similarly, for a N b, it means a is to the north of b, but horizontally, a's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of b onto the x-axis.

Given:
- x N y: This means x is to the north of y, but horizontally, x's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of y onto the x-axis.
- y N z: This means y is to the north of z, but horizontally, y's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z onto the x-axis.

By transitivity, x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)). Horizontally, x's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of y onto the x-axis, and y's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z onto the x-axis. This transitively means that x's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z onto the x-axis.

Given these, the relation between x and z is N, not NE or NW.

But wait, there's an issue here. The constraint for x N y is infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). This means the left boundary of x is to the right of or aligned with the left boundary of y, and the right boundary of x is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of y. 

Similarly, for y N z, infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). 

Combining these:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

So, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which satisfies the horizontal constraints for x N z. This means that x's horizontal projection can be contained within z's horizontal projection, which is the requirement for x N z (not x NE z or x NW z).

Let me think about whether it's possible for x to be NE or NW of z.

For x NE z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is below x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (z is to the left of x)

Given our constraints:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), so the first condition is met.
- For the second condition, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
- But this doesn't directly tell us if supx(z) <= infx(x).
- If z is narrow and x is shifted far to the right, it's possible that z's right boundary is to the left of x's left boundary, making x NE z a possible relation.

Let's construct an example in this manner:

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 4] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [5, 6] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x): 2 <= 5, supx(x) <= supx(y): 6 !<= 4... This doesn't work. Let me try again).

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 6] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [5, 6] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x): 2 <= 5, supx(x) <= supx(y): 6 <= 6, and supy(y) <= infy(x): 4 <= 5. So, x is N of y).
- Region z is such that y N z. Let's say z has boundaries: [0, 4] on the x-axis, [0, 1] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies infx(z) <= infx(y): 0 <= 2, supx(y) <= supx(z): 6 !<= 4. Again, this doesn't work. Let me try one more time).

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [2, 6] on the x-axis, [2, 4] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [5, 6] on the x-axis, [5, 6] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies the conditions for x N y).
- Region z is such that y N z. Let's say z has boundaries: [0, 7] on the x-axis, [0, 1] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies infx(z) <= infx(y): 0 <= 2, supx(y) <= supx(z): 6 <= 7, and supy(z) <= infy(y): 1 <= 2. So, y is N of z).

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)? 1 <= 5, so z is below x.
- Is x NE z? We need supx(z) <= infx(x): 7 <= 5, which is not true. So, x is not NE of z.
- Is x NW z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z): 6 <= 0, which is not true. So, x is not NW of z.
- Is x N z? We need infx(z) <= infx(x): 0 <= 5, which is true, and supx(x) <= supx(z): 6 <= 7, which is true. So, x is N of z.

It seems like the relation is always x N z. Let's think about why:

For x N y and y N z, we have:
- x's horizontal projection is contained within y's horizontal projection.
- y's horizontal projection is contained within z's horizontal projection.
- By transitivity, x's horizontal projection is contained within z's horizontal projection.
- Hence, x N z.

Given that NE and NW require x (or at least, its horizontal projections) to be completely to the right or left of z, which conflicts with x's horizontal projection being contained within z's horizontal projection, NE and NW are not possible relations.

So, the answer is: N. Just N.

Actually, let me consider if there are any other possible relations apart from N, NE, and NW.

For x E z (east of z), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (z is to the left of x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertically, x's projection is contained within z's projection)

Given our constraints, we know z is below x, which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the requirement for E, which needs x's vertical projection to be contained within z's vertical projection. So, E is not a possible relation.

For x SE z (south-east of z), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (z is to the left of x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

Given our constraints, we know z is below x, which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the requirement for SE, which needs x to be below z. So, SE is not a possible relation.

For x S z (south of z), we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (horizontally, x's projection is contained within z's projection)

Given our constraints, we know z is below x, which contradicts the requirement for S, which needs x to be below z. So, S is not a possible relation.

For x SW z (south-west of z), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

Given our constraints, we know z is below x, which contradicts the requirement for SW, which needs x to be below z. So, SW is not a possible relation.

For x W z (west of z), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertically, x's projection is contained within z's projection)

Given our constraints, we know z is below x, which contradicts the requirement for W, which needs x's vertical projection to be contained within z's vertical projection. So, W is not a possible relation.

For x B z (bounding box), we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
  (Essentially, x is contained within z's minimum bounding box)

Given our constraints, we know z is below x, which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the requirement for B, which needs x's vertical projection to be contained within z's vertical projection. So, B is not a possible relation.

Wait, after thinking a bit more, I'm not sure I've got it right, so let me take a step back.

Starting from scratch, let's reconsider the definition of N and the conditions of the problem.

For x N y, we need:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (y is below x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right boundary of x is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of y)

Essentially, y is to the south of x, but horizontally, x's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of y onto the x-axis.

For y N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of z is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the right boundary of z)

Essentially, z is to the south of y, but horizontally, y's projection onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z onto the x-axis.

Given these, by transitivity, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which is consistent with x being to the north of z. However, the horizontal constraints for N, NE, and NW need to be checked.

For x N z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
Transitivity gives us infx(z) <= infx(x), satisfying the first condition for N.

Also:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)
Transitivity gives us supx(x) <= supx(z), satisfying the second condition for N.

So, x N z is indeed a valid relation, stemming directly from the transitivity of our constraints.

For x NE z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is below x, which is true by transitivity)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (z is to the left of x)

For x NW z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is below x, which is true by transitivity)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

For x NE z, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) from x N y and supx(y) <= supx(z) from y N z, but no direct constraint on supx(z) and infx(x). 

For x NW z, we have supx(x) <= supx(y) from x N y and infx(z) <= infx(y) from y N z, but no direct constraint on supx(x) and infx(z).

it's clear that x NE z and x NW z are not generally guaranteed from our constraints. However, the question is asking about "possible" relations, not "guaranteed" relations.

Let's construct examples to test if x NE z or x NW z are possible.

For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). Let's try to design a scenario:
1. y has a wide horizontal projection.
2. x is narrow and is positioned to the right side of y's horizontal projection.
3. z is narrow and is positioned to the left side of y's horizontal projection.
4. This might make it such that z's right boundary is to the left of x's left boundary, fulfilling the condition supx(z) <= infx(x).

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [3, 9] on the x-axis, [3, 5] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [7, 8] on the x-axis, [6, 8] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x): 3 <= 7, supx(x) <= supx(y): 8 <= 9, and supy(y) <= infy(x): 5 <= 6.)
- Region z is such that y N z. Let's say z has boundaries: [1, 6] on the x-axis, [1, 2] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies infx(z) <= infx(y): 1 <= 3, supx(y) <= supx(z): 9 !<= 6, which is not true. Let me revise.)

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [3, 9] on the x-axis, [3, 5] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [7, 8] on the x-axis, [6, 8] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies the conditions for x N y).
- Region z is such that y N z. Let's say z has boundaries: [1, 10] on the x-axis, [1, 2] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies infx(z) <= infx(y): 1 <= 3, supx(y) <= supx(z): 9 <= 10, and supy(z) <= infy(y): 2 <= 3. So, y is N of z).

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)? 2 <= 6, so z is below x.
- Is x NE z? We need supx(z) <= infx(x): 10 <= 7, which is not true. So, x is not NE of z.
- Is x NW z? We need supx(x) <= infx(z): 8 <= 1, which is not true. So, x is not NW of z.
- Is x N z? We need infx(z) <= infx(x): 1 <= 7, which is true, and supx(x) <= supx(z): 8 <= 10, which is true. So, x is N of z.

Let me try to refine my example for NE a bit more:

Example for NE:
- Region y has boundaries: [3, 9] on the x-axis, [3, 5] on the y-axis.
- Region x is N of y, so x has boundaries: [7, 8] on the x-axis, [6, 8] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies the conditions for x N y).
- Region z is such that y N z. Let's say z has boundaries: [1, 6] on the x-axis, [1, 2] on the y-axis.
  (This satisfies supy(z) <= infy(y): 2 <= 3, but supx(y) <= supx(z): 9 <= 6 is not satisfied).

I'm running into the same issue. Due to the constraint supx(y) <= supx(z) from y N z, z's horizontal projection extends at least as far as y's horizontal projection to the right. And since y's horizontal projection contains x's horizontal projection (from x N y), z's horizontal projection must also contain x's horizontal projection, making the NE relation impossible.

Similarly, the constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) from y N z means z's horizontal projection extends at least as far as y's horizontal projection to the left. And since y's horizontal projection contains x's horizontal projection (from x N y), z's horizontal projection must also contain x's horizontal projection, making the NW relation impossible as well.

So, I believe that only N is a possible relation between x and z.

To check one more time, let's revisit the conditions:

For x N y, we need:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (y is below x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's horizontal projection is contained within y's horizontal projection)

For y N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's horizontal projection is contained within z's horizontal projection)

From these, by transitivity, we get:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is below x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's horizontal projection is contained within z's horizontal projection)

This exactly defines x N z. So, the relation between x and z is only N.

Therefore, the answer to the question "If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is just N.

ANSWER:

N is the only possible relation between region x and region z.

When region x is N of region y, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or aligned with y's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or aligned with y's right boundary)

When region y is N of region z, we know:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left boundary is to the right of or aligned with z's left boundary)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right boundary is to the left of or aligned with z's right boundary)

By transitivity:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or aligned with z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or aligned with z's right boundary)

These constraints exactly satisfy the definition of N (North), making it the only possible relation between x and z.
