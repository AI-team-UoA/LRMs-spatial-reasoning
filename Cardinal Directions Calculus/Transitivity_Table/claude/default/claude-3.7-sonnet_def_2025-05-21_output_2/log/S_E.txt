PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We know that:
- Region x is S (South) of region y, meaning x S y.
- Region y is E (East) of region z, meaning y E z.

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions of S and E:

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Now, let's apply these definitions to our scenario:

- x S y means: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y E z means: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these conditions, let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

From x S y, we have:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y E z, we have:
4. supx(z) <= infx(y)
5. infy(z) <= infy(y)
6. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's see what we can deduce about the position of x relative to z:

Using 2 and 4, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, supx(z) <= infx(x), which is one of the conditions for relations E, NE, and SE between x and z.

Using 5 and 1, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
There's no direct inference from these two conditions alone.

Using 6 and inequality 1, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
So, supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now, let's try to be more systematic and check which of the nine possible relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) can exist between x and z based on the conditions we've deduced.

We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which is one of the conditions for relations E, NE, and SE.

We also know that supy(x) <= supy(z), so x cannot be N, NW, or NE of z (since these relations require supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z)).

Given that supx(z) <= infx(x), x cannot be W, NW, SW, or B of z (these relations require infx(x) <= supx(z)).

Let's systematically check each relation:

1. x N z: This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we've deduced that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

2. x NE z: This requires supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x). We've established supx(z) <= infx(x), but not supy(z) <= infy(x). In fact, we've deduced supy(x) <= supy(z), which is in the opposite direction. So, x cannot be NE of z (as already noted above).

3. x E z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We haven't made any direct deduction about infy(z) in relation to infy(x). 

So, x E z is a possibility, provided infy(z) <= infy(x). This condition says that the lower y-bound of z is not above the lower y-bound of x, which makes sense for x to be directly east of z.

4. x SE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've established supx(z) <= infx(x), but we haven't made a direct deduction about supy(x) in relation to infy(z).

So, x SE z is a possibility, provided supy(x) <= infy(z). This condition says that the upper y-bound of x is below the lower y-bound of z, which makes sense for x to be southeast of z.

5. x S z: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've deduced that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

6. x SW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've deduced that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. x W z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've deduced that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

8. x NW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've deduced that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be NW of z.

9. x B z: This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've deduced that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be B (inside the bounding box) of z.

Let's double-check our analysis for x E z and x SE z.

For x E z, we need:
a. supx(z) <= infx(x) (This is deduced from our original conditions.)
b. infy(z) <= infy(x) (We haven't directly inferred this, but it's possible.)
c. supy(x) <= supy(z) (This is deduced from our original conditions.)

For x SE z, we need:
a. supx(z) <= infx(x) (This is deduced from our original conditions.)
b. supy(x) <= infy(z) (We haven't directly inferred this, but it's possible.)

I just realized that I haven't checked the S relation properly. Let me re-check for x S z.

For x S z, we need:
a. supy(x) <= infy(z) (We haven't directly inferred this, but it's possible.)
b. infx(z) <= infx(x) (This can be derived from supx(z) <= infx(x), assuming z is a well-formed region.)
c. supx(x) <= supx(z) (This isn't a direct inference from our original conditions.)

Let's re-evaluate. We know:
- Region x is S of region y, meaning x S y.
- Region y is E of region z, meaning y E z.

From these, we've deduced that supx(z) <= infx(x).

Actually, I think I have been over-constraining the problem. Let me re-think the relationships and see what's physically possible.

Given that x is south of y and y is east of z, the relative positions can be visualized as follows:

```
    z --- y
           |
           |
           x
```

So, x is southeast of z. But there could be other possibilities too, for instance, x could be directly east of z if it's far enough to the east:

```
    z --- y
          /
         /
        x
```

Let me manually check each of the nine cardinal directions:

1. x N z: This means x is north of z. Given the diagram, this seems impossible since x is below y and y is to the right of z.

2. x NE z: This means x is northeast of z. Given the diagram, this seems unlikely unless x is very far to the right.

3. x E z: This means x is directly east of z. This is possible if x is far enough to the right, such that its projection on the y-axis overlaps with z's.

4. x SE z: This means x is southeast of z. This is the most natural arrangement given the constraints.

5. x S z: This means x is directly south of z. This is possible if x is right below z.

6. x SW z: This means x is southwest of z. Given that x is south of y and y is east of z, it's difficult for x to be southwest of z. It would mean x is to the left of z, which seems unlikely.

7. x W z: This means x is directly west of z. Given the constraints, this seems impossible.

8. x NW z: This means x is northwest of z. Given the constraints, this seems impossible.

9. x B z: This means x is within the bounding box of z. Given the constraints, this seems impossible.

Wait, I need to be more precise. Let's really understand what the definitions of S and E tell us.

x S y means:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y) (The top of x is below the bottom of y.)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) (The left edge of y is to the left of the left edge of x.)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) (The right edge of x is to the left of the right edge of y.)

y E z means:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (The right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of y.)
2. infy(z) <= infy(y) (The bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y.)
3. supy(y) <= supy(z) (The top of y is below or at the same level as the top of z.)

Now, from these, what can we deduce about the relationship between x and z?

From 1 of x S y and 1 of y E z, we know that supy(x) <= infy(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y). These don't directly tell us anything about the relative positions of x and z.

From 1 of x S y and 2 of y E z, we know that supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). Transitivity doesn't apply here, so we can't directly deduce anything.

From 1 of x S y and 3 of y E z, we know that supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). By transitivity, we can say supy(x) <= supy(z). This means the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z.

From 2 of x S y and 1 of y E z, we know that infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(y). By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(x). This means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. This is a key constraint that suggests x is to the east, southeast, or northeast of z.

From 2 of x S y and the other conditions of y E z, there's no direct inference.

From 3 of x S y and the other conditions of y E z, there's no direct inference.

alright, based on these deductions, we have:
1. supy(x) <= supy(z) (This is from deduction 3 above.)
2. supx(z) <= infx(x) (This is from deduction 4 above.)

These two conditions alone don't uniquely determine the cardinal direction relation between x and z. To do so, we need to know the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), and the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). Let's explore the possibilities:

1. If infy(x) <= infy(z), then with supy(x) <= supy(z), it would suggest that x can be to the east of z (provided infy(z) <= supy(x)) or southeast of z (provided supy(x) <= infy(z)).

2. If infy(z) <= infy(x), then with supy(x) <= supy(z), it would suggest that x can be to the east of z (provided infy(z) <= supy(x)) or southeast of z (provided supy(x) <= infy(z)), just like in the first case.

Actually, the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) doesn't uniquely determine the cardinal direction. We need to understand the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z):

1. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then with supx(z) <= infx(x), it suggests that x is southeast of z.

2. If infy(z) <= supy(x), then with supy(x) <= supy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x), it suggests that x is to the east of z.

Let's check other direction relations using the deduced constraints:

For x S z, we need:
a. supy(x) <= infy(z) (Possible)
b. infx(z) <= infx(x) (This can be derived from supx(z) <= infx(x), assuming z is a well-formed region.)
c. supx(x) <= supx(z) (Not guaranteed from our deductions, but possible in certain configurations.)

For x S z to hold, both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) must be true. These are not directly inferable from our original constraints. 

Let's also check x E z.

For x E z, we need:
a. supx(z) <= infx(x) (This is deduced from our original conditions.)
b. infy(z) <= infy(x) (Not directly inferred, but possible.)
c. supy(x) <= supy(z) (This is deduced from our original conditions.)

For x E z to hold, condition b, which is infy(z) <= infy(x), also needs to be satisfied. This condition is not directly inferable from our original constraints, but it's certainly possible.

Finally, let's check the constraint for x SE z.

For x SE z, we need:
a. supx(z) <= infx(x) (This is deduced from our original conditions.)
b. supy(x) <= infy(z) (Not directly inferred, but possible.)

For x SE z to hold, condition b, which is supy(x) <= infy(z), also needs to be satisfied. This condition is not directly inferable from our original constraints, but it's certainly possible.

Ok, let me try yet another approach. Let's go to basics and use the constraint regions. 

From the definition it seems like regions are subsets of R^2 (the 2D plane). So we can draw points (x, y) to represent the locations.

When regions x is S of region y, there's a constraint on their mutual locations: The top (supy) of x is below or at the same level as the bottom (infy) of y. There're also constraints on their left and right boundaries. But given the specific configuration, we can easily think of examples where region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, and try to infer the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's draw a simple example to verify:
- Region z might be a box with corners (0, 0), (1, 1)
- Region y might be a box with corners (2, 0), (3, 1)
- Region x might be a box with corners (2, -1), (3, -0.5)

In this instance, x is south of y and y is east of z. And the relation between x and z is SE, because x is to the southeast of z.

But we can move region x around and see if other relations are possible. 

If we move region x to have corners (0, -1), (1, -0.5), then x is still to the south of y (it's directly below z now), and the relation between x and z is S.

If we move region x to have corners (2, -0.5), (3, 0), then x is still to the south of y (it's slightly overlapping with y in the y-axis), and the relation between x and z is SE (because it's to the southeast of z).

Actually, I just realized that my drawing isn't right. Let's redraw:
- Region z might be a box with corners (0, 0), (1, 1)
- Region y might be a box with corners (2, 0), (3, 1)
- Region x might be a box with corners (2, -1), (3, -0.5)

Now x S y because the top of x (-0.5) is below the bottom of y (0), and the left edge of y (2) is not to the right of the left edge of x (2), and the right edge of x (3) is not to the right of the right edge of y (3).

Also, y E z because the right of z (1) is to the left of the left of y (2), and the bottom of z (0) is not above the bottom of y (0), and the top of y (1) is not above the top of z (1).

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
Clearly, the right of z (1) is to the left of the left of x (2), which satisfies the condition for x being East, NE, or SE of z. But since the top of x (-0.5) is below the bottom of z (0), we conclude that x is SE of z.

But if we try to move x, we can get different relations. Let's move x to (0, -1) to (1, -0.5):
- The top of x (-0.5) is below the bottom of z (0), which satisfies the condition for x being South, SW, or SE of z.
- The left edge of z (0) is not to the right of the left edge of x (0), and the right edge of x (1) is not to the right of the right edge of z (1), which satisfies the additional condition for x being South of z.

So, in this case, x is S of z.

Let's try one more example. Move x to (2, 0.5) to (3, 0.8):
- The right of z (1) is to the left of the left of x (2), which satisfies the condition for x being East, NE, or SE of z.
- The bottom of z (0) is not above the bottom of x (0.5), and the top of x (0.8) is not above the top of z (1), which satisfies the additional condition for x being East of z.

So, in this case, x is E of z.

I'm pretty sure that these are all the possible relations, given the constraints. Here's the reason:

- From the constraint that x is S of y, we have that the top of x is below the bottom of y.
- From the constraint that y is E of z, we have that the right of z is to the left of the left of y.

Given these, it's always the case that the right of z is to the left of the left of x (because the left of x is either to the right of or at the same position as the left of y). This immediately rules out the possibility of x being N, NW, W, SW, or B in relation to z.

So the only possibilities are NE, E, or SE. But the first constraint (top of x is below the bottom of y) and the constraint that the bottom of z is not above the bottom of y make it unlikely that x is NE of z. Because if it were, the top of x would be above the bottom of z, which would imply that the bottom of y is also above the bottom of z (contradicting the constraint of y being E of z). I think this is a bit of a stretch, so and want to be careful. Let me verify this reasoning:

If x is NE of z, then the bottom of z would be below or at the same level as the top of x. But if the bottom of z is below the top of x, and the top of x is below the bottom of y (from x S y), then the bottom of z is below the bottom of y. This isn't impossible, but it feels like an edge case.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Based on our drawing exercises, we've established that the possible relations between x and z can be:
1. S (South)
2. SE (South East)
3. E (East)

Let's double-check by systematically examining all 9 relations. 

First, we already know that the right of z is to the left of the left of x (supx(z) <= infx(x)). This alone rules out N, NW, W, SW, and B relations, because all of these would require the left of x to be to the left of the right of z.

Now, for NE: 
- NE requires that the top of z is below the bottom of x.
- However, from x S y, we know that the top of x is below the bottom of y.
- From y E z, we know that the top of y is at or below the top of z.
- These combined imply that the top of x is below the top of z, which contradicts the condition for x being NE of z.

Actually, no. Let me clarify the reasoning about NE.

For x NE z, we need:
1. The top of z (supy(z)) is below or at the same level as the bottom of x (infy(x)).
2. The right of z (supx(z)) is to the left of or at the same position as the left of x (infx(x)).

From x S y, we know that the top of x (supy(x)) is below or at the same level as the bottom of y (infy(y)).

From y E z, we know that the bottom of z (infy(z)) is below or at the same level as the bottom of y (infy(y)) and the top of y (supy(y)) is below or at the same level as the top of z (supy(z)).

So, transitively, we know that the top of x (supy(x)) is below or at the same level as the bottom of y (infy(y)). But we don't have any direct relationship between the bottom of x (infy(x)) and the top of z (supy(z)).

This means that while we've ruled out N, NW, W, SW, and B, we can't yet rule out NE based on the constraints we have. In fact, it's possible that x is to the northeast of z, provided that the bottom of x is above the top of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be:
1. NE (North East)
2. E (East)
3. SE (South East)
4. S (South)

Wait a second. Let me revisit our drawings to check the NE possibility.
- Region z might be a box with corners (0, 0), (1, 1)
- Region y might be a box with corners (2, 0), (3, 1)

For x to be NE of z, the bottom of x (infy(x)) should be above the top of z (supy(z)), which is 1. And the left of x (infx(x)) should be to the right of the right of z (supx(z)), which is 1.

So, let's place x at (2, 1.5) to (3, 2).

With this, the top of x (2) is above the bottom of y (0), which contradicts the constraint that x is S of y (which requires the top of x to be below the bottom of y).

So, it seems like x can't be NE of z while still maintaining the constraint that x is S of y.

Ok, I see. The reason why NE can be ruled out is because the constraint:

From x S y, we know that the top of x (supy(x)) is below or at the same level as the bottom of y (infy(y)).
From y E z, we know that the bottom of y (infy(y)) is below or at the same level as the top of z (supy(z)).

So, transitively, the top of x (supy(x)) is below or at the same level as the top of z (supy(z)).

This is exactly the opposite of what's needed for x to be NE of z, which requires the bottom of x (infy(x)) to be above the top of z (supy(z)).

Given that infy(x) <= supy(x) (by definition of a region), if supy(x) <= supy(z), then infy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the requirement for x to be NE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be:
1. E (East)
2. SE (South East)
3. S (South)

One more possibility I want to check. For completeness, let's consider the relation where x is SOUTH (S) of z.
- For x S z, we need the top of x (supy(x)) to be below the bottom of z (infy(z)), the left of z (infx(z)) to be to the left of the left of x (infx(x)), and the right of x (supx(x)) to be to the left of the right of z (supx(z)).

From x S y, we know that the top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)).
From y E z, we know that the bottom of y (infy(y)) is below or at the same level as the top of z (supy(z)).

Transitively, the top of x (supy(x)) is below the top of z (supy(z)). But this doesn't guarantee that the top of x is below the bottom of z.

However, I think S is still a possible configuration. The constraint from y E z says that the bottom of y is below or at the same level as the top of z, it doesn't constrain the relationships between the bottom of y and the bottom of z. So, it's possible that the bottom of z is above the bottom of y, which would make it possible for the top of x (which is below the bottom of y) to also be below the bottom of z.

From a more physically intuitive perspective: Imagine z at (0, 0) to (1, 1) and y at (2, 0) to (3, 1). Now, place x at (0.5, -1) to (0.8, -0.5). In this configuration, x is S of y (because the top of x at -0.5 is below the bottom of y at 0) and y is E of z (because the right of z at 1 is to the left of the left of y at 2). And the relation between x and z is S, because the top of x at -0.5 is below the bottom of z at 0, and the left of z at 0 is to the left of the left of x at 0.5, and the right of x at 0.8 is to the left of the right of z at 1.

Alright, let me check again:
- Constraint 1: x S y, which means the top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)), the left of y (infx(y)) is not to the right of the left of x (infx(x)), and the right of x (supx(x)) is not to the right of the right of y (supx(y)).
- Constraint 2: y E z, which means the right of z (supx(z)) is to the left of the left of y (infx(y)), the bottom of z (infy(z)) is not above the bottom of y (infy(y)), and the top of y (supy(y)) is not above the top of z (supy(z)).

From Constraint 1, we get the top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)).
From Constraint 2, we get the right of z (supx(z)) is to the left of the left of y (infx(y)).

Transitively, the right of z (supx(z)) is to the left of the left of x (infx(x)), which means x can't be N, NW, W, SW, or B in relation to z.

What's the possibility of x being NE of z?
For x NE z, we need the bottom of x (infy(x)) to be above the top of z (supy(z)).
From our constraints, we know that the top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)) and the top of y (supy(y)) is not above the top of z (supy(z)).
These don't directly give us a relation between the bottom of x and the top of z, so we can't rule out NE based on these alone.

Let's take another angle. From Constraint 1, we have the top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)).
From Constraint 2, we have the bottom of z (infy(z)) is not above the bottom of y (infy(y)).
If the bottom of z is below the bottom of y, and the top of x is below the bottom of y, then it's possible for the top of x to be below the bottom of z, which is a condition for x to be S or SW or SE of z.

But if the bottom of z is at the same level as the bottom of y, and the top of x is below the bottom of y, then the top of x is also below the bottom of z, which again is a condition for x to be S or SW or SE of z.

So, it seems like the relation between x and z could be S, SW, or SE. But we already ruled out SW because the right of z is to the left of the left of x. So, the relation could be S or SE.

What's the possibility of x being E of z?
For x E z, we need the right of z (supx(z)) to be to the left of the left of x (infx(x)), the bottom of z (infy(z)) to be not above the bottom of x (infy(x)), and the top of x (supy(x)) to be not above the top of z (supy(z)).
We've already established that the right of z is to the left of the left of x. From our constraints, we know that the top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)) and the top of y (supy(y)) is not above the top of z (supy(z)).
Transitively, the top of x (supy(x)) is below the top of y (supy(y)), which is not above the top of z (supy(z)). So, the top of x is below the top of z, which satisfies one of the conditions for x E z.
We haven't directly derived a relation between the bottom of z and the bottom of x, but it's possible that the bottom of z is not above the bottom of x, satisfying the other condition for x E z.

So, E is also a possible relation.

In conclusion, from our analysis, the possible relations between x and z can be:
1. E (East)
2. SE (South East)
3. S (South)

Hmm, I suppose I'm overthinking the NE possibility. Let's be sure.

For x NE z, we need the bottom of x (infy(x)) to be above the top of z (supy(z)).

Here are the relevant constraints:
- From x S y, we know that the top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)).
- From y E z, we know that the top of y (supy(y)) is not above the top of z (supy(z)).

For x to be NE of z, we need the bottom of x to be above the top of z. But we know that the top of x is below the bottom of y. Since the bottom of x is below the top of x (by definition of a region), the bottom of x is also below the bottom of y.

Now, the relation between the bottom of y and the top of z isn't directly constrained. However, given that the top of y is not above the top of z, it's unclear if the bottom of y is above, below, or at the same level as the top of z.

If the bottom of y is below the top of z, then the bottom of x is also below the top of z (since the bottom of x is below the bottom of y). This would contradict the requirement for x to be NE of z.
a
But if the bottom of y is above the top of z, then we don't have a direct constraint on the relation between the bottom of x and the top of z. It's possible that the bottom of x is still below the top of z.

Let's try to visualize this:
- Region z might be a box with corners (0, 0), (1, 1)
- Region y might be a box with corners (2, 2), (3, 3) (This is different from before, but it's a valid configuration where y is E of z.)
- Now, place x at (2, 1.5), (3, 1.9). In this configuration, x is S of y (because the top of x at 1.9 is below the bottom of y at 2) and y is E of z (because the right of z at 1 is to the left of the left of y at 2). And the relation between x and z is NE, because the bottom of x at 1.5 is above the top of z at 1, and the left of x at 2 is to the right of the right of z at 1.

This is a valid configuration that is consistent with the constraints, and the relation between x and z is NE. So, NE is indeed a possibility.

Let me check the possibility of x being NE of z using the constraints:
- From x S y, we know that the top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)).
- From y E z, we know that the bottom of z (infy(z)) is not above the bottom of y (infy(y)), and the top of y (supy(y)) is not above the top of z (supy(z)).

If the bottom of y is above the top of z, then the top of x is below the bottom of y. In this case, the relation between the top of x and the top of z isn't directly constrained. It's possible for the bottom of x to be above the top of z, which would make x NE of z.

Wait, I think I've been making a subtle mistake. The condition for y E z includes "the bottom of z (infy(z)) is not above the bottom of y (infy(y))". But this is different from saying "the bottom of y is not below the bottom of z". The correct interpretation is that infy(z) <= infy(y), which means the bottom of z is either below or at the same level as the bottom of y.

So, given this, can x be NE of z?
For x NE z, we need the bottom of x (infy(x)) to be above the top of z (supy(z)).
From our constraints, we know:
- The top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)) (from x S y).
- The bottom of z (infy(z)) is not above the bottom of y (infy(y)) (from y E z).
- The top of y (supy(y)) is not above the top of z (supy(z)) (from y E z).

I think x can indeed be NE of z. Let me try again with a concrete example:
- Region z might be a box with corners (0, 0), (1, 1).
- Region y might be a box with corners (2, 0.5), (3, 1). In this configuration, y is E of z.
- Now, place x at (2, 0.1), (3, 0.4). In this configuration, x is S of y. 

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
The bottom of x (0.1) is above the bottom of z (0), and the top of x (0.4) is below the top of z (1). The left of x (2) is to the right of the right of z (1). This makes x E of z, not NE.

Let's make y higher:
- Region z might be a box with corners (0, 0), (1, 1).
- Region y might be a box with corners (2, 2), (3, 3). In this configuration, y is E of z.
- Now, place x at (2, 1.5), (3, 1.9). In this configuration, x is S of y. 

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
The bottom of x (1.5) is above the top of z (1), which makes x NE of z. This satisfies the condition for x to be NE of z, and it's consistent with the constraints.

So, to be clear:
- For y E z, we have: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).
- If we have a case where infy(y) > supy(z) (the bottom of y is above the top of z), then the third condition, supy(y) <= supy(z), is trivially satisfied. This is because an interpretation of supy(y) <= supy(z) as saying that the top of y is not above the top of z.

Given this, I have established that x being NE of z is a possible relation. Let's check the rest of the relations one by one:

For x N z, we need the top of z (supy(z)) to be below the bottom of x (infy(x)).
From our constraints, we know:
- The top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)) (from x S y).
- The bottom of z (infy(z)) is not above the bottom of y (infy(y)) (from y E z).
- The top of y (supy(y)) is not above the top of z (supy(z)) (from y E z).

For x N z, the left of z should also be to the left of the left of x and the right of x should be to the left of the right of z. But from our constraints, we know that the right of z is to the left of the left of y. And, plausibly, the left of y is to the left of the left of x. This contradiction means x can't be N of z.

Actually, wait. The condition for x S y also included the constraint "the left of y (infx(y)) is not to the right of the left of x (infx(x))". This is also a bit of a cryptic way of saying infx(y) <= infx(x). That is, the left edge of y is to the left of the left edge of x. Ok, that's what I had been assuming.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be:
1. NE (North East) (only if the bottom of y is above the top of z)
2. E (East)
3. SE (South East)
4. S (South)

However, I feel like I'm overlooking the conditions for S (x S z). Let me just double check more carefully.
For x S z, we need:
1. The top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of z (infy(z)). And that seems possible. From x S y, we know that supy(x) <= infy(y). From y E z, we know that infy(z) <= infy(y). So transitively, supy(x) <= infy(z), not necessarily strictly below.
2. The left of z (infx(z)) is not to the right of the left of x (infx(x)). That is, infx(z) <= infx(x). From x S y, we have infx(y) <= infx(x). But from y E z, we know that supx(z) <= infx(y).
3. The right of x (supx(x)) is not to the right of the right of z (supx(z)). That is, supx(x) <= supx(z). From x S y, we have supx(x) <= supx(y). But from y E z, there's no direct relation between supx(y) and supx(z).

Hmm, I don't think we have enough constraints to make a definite decision on whether x S z is a possibility. Let me try a concrete example and see:
- Region z might be a box with corners (0, 0), (3, 1).
- Region y might be a box with corners (4, 0), (5, 1). In this configuration, y is E of z.
- Now, place x at (1, -1), (2, -0.5). In this configuration, x is S of y. And the relation between x and z is S, because the top of x (-0.5) is below the bottom of z (0), the left of z (0) is to the left of the left of x (1), and the right of x (2) is to the left of the right of z (3).

But actually, the constraints for y E z is not necessarily as I imagained them. Let me check specifically what the constraints really are:
For y E z, we need:
1. The right of z (supx(z)) is to the left of the left of y (infx(y)). That is, supx(z) <= infx(y).
2. The bottom of z (infy(z)) is not above the bottom of y (infy(y)). That is, infy(z) <= infy(y).
3. The top of y (supy(y)) is not above the top of z (supy(z)). That is, supy(y) <= supy(z).

And from constraints (1) and (3), we can see that the regions could look like this:
```
         z
      /-----\
     |       |
     |       |       y
     |       |    /-----\
     |       |    |     |
      \-----/     |     |
                   \---/
```

But constraints (1) and (2) and (3) could also look like this, e.g., if the bottom of z (infy(z)) is below the bottom of y (infy(y)) and the top of y (supy(y)) is below the top of z (supy(z)):
```
              z
           /-----\
          |       |
   y      |       |
/-----\   |       |
|     |   |       |
 \---/     \-----/
```

and the constraint is still satisified if the regions are at the same height on the bottom, and the top of y reaches the same height as the top of z.
```
   y            z
/-----\      /-----\
|     |      |     |
|     |      |     |
|     |      |     |
 \---/        \---/
```

The only sure thing from the constraints is that the right of z (supx(z)) is to the left of the left of y (infx(y)), which ensures that they don't overlap in the x-axis. And from the constraint that x is to the south of y we can also place x differently, satisfying different spatial relations with respect to z.

Hmm, I think I'm overthinking things. Probably it's easier to just draw the configuration and reason in concrete fashion.

Let's set y at (2, 0), (3, 1). Then we can place z at (0, 0), (1, 1) or at (0, -1), (1, 0).

- If z is at (0, 0), (1, 1), then the following are some possible locations for x:

1. x at (0, -1), (1, -0.5). This would make x S of z.
2. x at (2, -1), (3, -0.5). This would make x SE of z.
3. x at (2, 0.5), (3, 0.9). This would make x E of z.

- If z is at (0, -1), (1, 0), then:

1. x can still be S of z, if it's placed at (0, -2), (1, -1.5).
2. x can also be SE of z, if it's placed at (2, -2), (3, -1.5).
3. x can be E of z, if it's placed at (2, -1), (3, -0.5).
4. But now, x can also be NE of z, if it's placed at (2, 0.1), (3, 0.5) (since the bottom of x at 0.1 is above the top of z at 0).

This confirms our findings. The possible relations between x and z can be:
1. NE (North East) (only if the bottom of y is above the top of z)
2. E (East)
3. SE (South East)
4. S (South)

Hmm, now actually I realize that the "benchmark" definition of the relations isn't quite the same the intuitive notion. Let's check the definition more.

For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
From our constraints, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)

For x S z, we need:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, we know that supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This means that both supy(x) and infy(z) are below infy(y). However, we don't have a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), but it's also possible that infy(z) < supy(x). So, this is not necessarily satisfied.
2. infx(z) <= infx(x). We know that supx(z) <= infx(y) (the right of z is to the left of the left of y) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left of y is to the left of the left of x). By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(z) <= supx(z) (by definition of a region), we have infx(z) <= infx(x). This condition is satisfied if the regions are wellformed.
3. supx(x) <= supx(z). We don't have any constraints that directly relate these.

So, x S z is a possibility if the first and third conditions are met.

For x SE z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x). This is satisfied based on the reasoning above.
2. supy(x) <= infy(z). As discussed above, this is possible but not guaranteed.

So, x SE z is a possibility if the second condition is met.

For x E z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x). This is satisfied based on the reasoning above.
2. infy(z) <= infy(x). We know that infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't have a direct relation between infy(y) and infy(x).
3. supy(x) <= supy(z). We know that supy(x) <= infy(y), but we don't have a direct relation between infy(y) and supy(z).

So, x E z is a possibility if the second and third conditions are met.

For x NE z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x). This is satisfied based on the reasoning above.
2. supy(z) <= infy(x). We know that supy(x) <= infy(y), but we don't have a direct relation between supy(z) and infy(x).

So, x NE z is a possibility if the second condition is met.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z, given that x S y and y E z, can be:
1. NE (North East) (if conditions for NE are met)
2. E (East) (if conditions for E are met)
3. SE (South East) (if conditions for SE are met)
4. S (South) (if conditions for S are met)

I've been hesitant because I've been trying to determine which of these are the guaranteed relations. But I think the qustion is actually asking about which of these are even possible relations.

And, as we've shown through concrete examples and reasoning, all of the relations NE, E, SE, and S are possible relations between x and z, given that x S y and y E z.

Let me verify with a few more concrete examples:

For NE:
- y at (2, 2), (3, 3)
- z at (0, 0), (1, 1)
- x at (2, 1.2), (3, 1.8)
The top of x (1.8) is below the bottom of y (2), and the right of z (1) is to the left of the left of y (2). The bottom of x (1.2) is above the top of z (1), which makes x NE of z.

For E:
- y at (2, 0), (3, 1)
- z at (0, 0), (1, 1)
- x at (2, 0.2), (3, 0.8)
The top of x (0.8) is below the bottom of y (0), and the right of z (1) is to the left of the left of y (2). The bottom of x (0.2) is above the bottom of z (0), and the top of x (0.8) is below the top of z (1), which makes x E of z.

For SE:
- y at (2, 0), (3, 1)
- z at (0, 0), (1, 1)
- x at (2, -1), (3, -0.5)
The top of x (-0.5) is below the bottom of y (0), and the right of z (1) is to the left of the left of y (2). The top of x (-0.5) is below the bottom of z (0), which makes x SE of z.

For S:
- y at (2, 0), (3, 1)
- z at (0, -1), (1, 0)
- x at (0, -2), (1, -1.5)
The top of x (-1.5) is below the bottom of y (0), and the right of z (1) is to the left of the left of y (2). The top of x (-1.5) is below the bottom of z (-1), the left of z (0) is to the left of the left of x (0), and the right of x (1) is not to the right of the right of z (1), which makes x S of z.

So, all four relations (NE, E, SE, S) are possible.

Actually, I want to double-check all of this by writing the possible configurations in a general form.

If x S y, then:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

If y E z, then:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y)
2. infy(z) <= infy(y)
3. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's check the possible relations between x and z by systematically computing the possible configurations given these constraints.

Let's denote the coordinates of the corners of the regions:
- z has top-left (z_tl_x, z_tl_y) and bottom-right (z_br_x, z_br_y)
- y has top-left (y_tl_x, y_tl_y) and bottom-right (y_br_x, y_br_y)
- x has top-left (x_tl_x, x_tl_y) and bottom-right (x_br_x, x_br_y)

In terms of the functions used in the definitions, these correspond to:
- For z: infx(z) = z_tl_x, supx(z) = z_br_x, infy(z) = z_br_y, supy(z) = z_tl_y
- For y: infx(y) = y_tl_x, supx(y) = y_br_x, infy(y) = y_br_y, supy(y) = y_tl_y
- For x: infx(x) = x_tl_x, supx(x) = x_br_x, infy(x) = x_br_y, supy(x) = x_tl_y

The constraints for x S y become:
1. x_tl_y <= y_br_y
2. y_tl_x <= x_tl_x
3. x_br_x <= y_br_x

The constraints for y E z become:
1. z_br_x <= y_tl_x
2. z_br_y <= y_br_y
3. y_tl_y <= z_tl_y

Now, for the relation between x and z. Let's check NE:
For x NE z, we need:
1. z_br_x <= x_tl_x
2. z_tl_y <= x_br_y

For z_br_x <= x_tl_x, can be achieved. From y E z, we have z_br_x <= y_tl_x. From x S y, we have y_tl_x <= x_tl_x. Transitively, z_br_x <= x_tl_x.

For z_tl_y <= x_br_y, not necessarily satisfied. From the constraints, we know x_tl_y <= y_br_y, y_br_y <= z_br_y, and y_tl_y <= z_tl_y. None of these give us a direct relation between z_tl_y and x_br_y.

But it's possible to have z_tl_y <= x_br_y while still maintaining the constraints. For instance, we can have:
- z with top-left (0, 0) and bottom-right (1, 1)
- y with top-left (2, 2) and bottom-right (3, 3)
- x with top-left (2, 1.5) and bottom-right (3, 1.9)

So, NE is a possible relation.

Let's check E:
For x E z, we need:
1. z_br_x <= x_tl_x
2. z_br_y <= x_br_y
3. x_tl_y <= z_tl_y

We've already seen from the NE check that z_br_x <= x_tl_x can be satisfied. The other two conditions are not directly guaranteed from our constraints, but they can be achieved.

For z_br_y <= x_br_y, no direct guarantee from the constraints. But it's possible to have this.

For x_tl_y <= z_tl_y, we can get a partial chain from our constraints: x_tl_y <= y_br_y (from x S y) and y_tl_y <= z_tl_y (from y E z). But we don't have a direct relation between y_br_y and y_tl_y.

But it's possible to have both z_br_y <= x_br_y and x_tl_y <= z_tl_y while still maintaining the constraints. For instance, we can have:
- z with top-left (0, 0) and bottom-right (1, 1)
- y with top-left (2, 0) and bottom-right (3, 1)
- x with top-left (2, 0.2) and bottom-right (3, 0.8)

So, E is a possible relation.

Let's check SE:
For x SE z, we need:
1. z_br_x <= x_tl_x
2. x_tl_y <= z_br_y

We've already seen from the NE check that z_br_x <= x_tl_x can be satisfied. 

For x_tl_y <= z_br_y, we can use the chain: x_tl_y <= y_br_y (from x S y) and z_br_y <= y_br_y (from y E z). This would be transitive if the inequality was in the same direction. However, the inequality for the second relationship is in the opposite direction.

But it's possible to have x_tl_y <= z_br_y while still maintaining the constraints. For instance, we can have:
- z with top-left (0, 0) and bottom-right (1, 1)
- y with top-left (2, 0) and bottom-right (3, 1)
- x with top-left (2, -1) and bottom-right (3, -0.5)

So, SE is a possible relation.

Let's check S:
For x S z, we need:
1. x_tl_y <= z_br_y
2. z_tl_x <= x_tl_x
3. x_br_x <= z_br_x

For x_tl_y <= z_br_y, this can be achieved as shown in the SE check.

For z_tl_x <= x_tl_x, this isn't directly guaranteed from our constraints. From y E z, we have z_br_x <= y_tl_x, which gives us z_tl_x <= z_br_x <= y_tl_x. From x S y, we have y_tl_x <= x_tl_x. Transitively, z_tl_x <= x_tl_x. Actually this is guaranteed.

For x_br_x <= z_br_x, this isn't directly guaranteed from our constraints. But they might be achievable.

But it's possible to have all three conditions satisfied while still maintaining the constraints. For instance, we can have:
- z with top-left (0, -1) and bottom-right (3, 0)
- y with top-left (4, 0) and bottom-right (5, 1)
- x with top-left (1, -2) and bottom-right (2, -1.5)

So, S is a possible relation.

In conclusion, with the constraints that x S y and y E z, the possible relations between x and z can be NE, E, SE, and S.

Actually, hm, let's check S a bit more carefully. We need to check other cardinal directions too. For S, If z has top-left (0, -1) and bottom-right (3, 0), and y has top-left (4, 0) and bottom-right (5, 1), then to satisfy the S constraint, we need:
1. x_tl_y <= z_br_y, which means x_tl_y <= 0.
2. z_tl_x <= x_tl_x, which means 0 <= x_tl_x.
3. x_br_x <= z_br_x, which means x_br_x <= 3.

And to satisfy x S y, we need:
1. x_tl_y <= y_br_y, which means x_tl_y <= 1.
2. y_tl_x <= x_tl_x, which means 4 <= x_tl_x.
3. x_br_x <= y_br_x, which means x_br_x <= 5.

But these are in conflict: condition 2 for x S z says 0 <= x_tl_x, while condition 2 for x S y says 4 <= x_tl_x. They can't both be satisfied. So actually, x can't be S of z.

Wait, actually I've been a bit careless in how I'm defining the regions. Let me clarify the terminology:

1. infx(region) is the minimum x-coordinate of the region.
2. supx(region) is the maximum x-coordinate of the region.
3. infy(region) is the minimum y-coordinate of the region.
4. supy(region) is the maximum y-coordinate of the region.

So, if we have a rectangular region with top-left (a, d) and bottom-right (b, c), then infx(region) = a, supx(region) = b, infy(region) = c, and supy(region) = d.

Using this clarification, let's redress the issue. I will also be more careful in this final attempt.

If x S y, then:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

If y E z, then:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y)
2. infy(z) <= infy(y)
3. supy(y) <= supy(z)

From (1) of x S y and (2) of y E z, I can do a transitive inference: supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). 

Wait, then I still can't infer anything about supy(x) relative to infy(z).

From (2) of x S y and (1) of y E z, I can also do a transitive inference: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(y). So, supx(z) <= infx(x).

This second inference guarantees that x is to the east of z in some capacity (either NE, E, or SE).

But there are no constraints that definitively placne x in the north or south of z, so NE, E, and SE are all possibilities.

What about S?

For x S z, we need:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z)

From the constraints x S y and y E z, we've deduced that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the third condition for x S z, which requires supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, x cannot be S of z.

In conclusion, with the constraints that x S y and y E z, the possible relations between x and z can be NE, E, and SE.

Actually, I'm going to verify one more time.

If x S y, then supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).
If y E z, then supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

For the relation between x and z:
1. For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
2. For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
3. For x E z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
4. For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From the original constraints, we can deduce that supx(z) <= infx(x). This confirms that x can't be to the west of z in any capacity. 

For x S z, one of the conditions is supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (since a region's minimum x-coordinate, infx, is always less than or equal to its maximum x-coordinate, supx). So, x can't be S of z.

For x SE z, the conditions are supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition isn't directly deducible from the original constraints, but it's possible.

For x E z, the conditions are supx(z
