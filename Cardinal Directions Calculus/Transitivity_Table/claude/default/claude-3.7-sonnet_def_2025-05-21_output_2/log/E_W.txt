PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step by using the definitions of cardinal direction relations.

We know that:
1. x E y: This means that supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
2. y W z: This means that supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let's try to figure out what constraints these two relations put on the relationship between x and z.

From x E y, we know that region x is to the east of region y. This means that x is completely to the right of y on the x-axis (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)), and y's y-extent contains x's y-extent (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).

From y W z, we know that region y is to the west of region z. This means that y is completely to the left of z on the x-axis (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), and z's y-extent contains y's y-extent (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

First, let's consider the x-axis constraints:
- From x E y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

From these, we can't directly compare infx(x) and infx(z). So x could be to the left, to the right, or aligned with z on the x-axis.

Next, let's consider the y-axis constraints:
- From x E y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these, we get:
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means that z's y-extent contains x's y-extent, i.e., infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Now, let's consider all possible cases for the relationship between x and z on the x-axis:

1. If infx(x) > supx(z), then x is completely to the right of z on the x-axis. Combined with the y-axis constraints, this would make x E z.

2. If infx(z) > supx(x), then x is completely to the left of z on the x-axis. Combined with the y-axis constraints, this would make x W z.

3. If there's an overlap on the x-axis (neither of the above conditions is met), and given the y-axis constraints, x could be in any of the following relations with z: B, N, S, W, E, NW, SW, NE, SE.

However, because of the constraints from x E y and y W z, not all of these are possible.

Let's continue analyzing: since y is west of z, y is completely to the left of z. And since x is east of y, x is completely to the right of y.

So, on the x-axis, we have:
- Region y is positioned to the left of both regions x and z.
- But the relationship between regions x and z on the x-axis is not directly constrained.

I think I need to clarify my earlier reasoning. Let's break it down more carefully:

From x E y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

We can't directly determine the relationship between x and z on the x-axis. So, x could be to the left, to the right, or overlapping with z on the x-axis.

Now, for the y-axis:
From x E y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These inequalities tell us that on the y-axis, x's range is contained within z's range.

Given these constraints, let's determine all the possible relations between x and z:

1. If supx(z) < infx(x), then x would be E of z.
2. If supx(x) < infx(z), then x would be W of z.
3. If infx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(z) <= supx(x) (i.e., there's an overlap on the x-axis), and given the y-axis constraints, x could be B of z.

Wait, I'm not considering all possibilities correctly. Let me reconsider by going back to the original definitions:

- x E y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y W z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From x E y, we have region x positioned to the right of region y on the x-axis. From y W z, we have region y positioned to the left of region z on the x-axis.

We can conclude that on the x-axis:
- y is to the left of z (from y W z)
- x is to the right of y (from x E y)

But without additional constraints, we can't directly determine the relationship between x and z on the x-axis.

For the y-axis:
From x E y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Which gives us:
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means that on the y-axis, z's extent fully contains y's extent, which in turn fully contains x's extent.

Now, let's determine all possible relations between x and z:

1. If supx(z) < infx(x), then x would be E of z because x is completely to the right of z on the x-axis, and on the y-axis, x's extent is fully contained within z's extent.

2. If supx(x) < infx(z), then x would be W of z. But this contradicts what we know. Because y is to the left of z, and x is to the right of y, it's not possible for x to be to the left of z. So, this relation is not possible.

3. If there's an overlap on the x-axis, then based on our constraints for the y-axis, the relation could be B, NW, N, SW, or S.

Actually, let's be more precise in our reasoning. Let me outline the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. If x is completely to the east of z (supx(z) < infx(x)), and given the y-axis constraints (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), then x E z.

2. If x and z overlap on the x-axis:
   a. If x is inside z's bounding box on the x-axis (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), and given the y-axis constraints, then x B z.
   b. If x starts to the left of z and ends to the right of z on the x-axis (infx(x) < infx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z)), considering the y-axis constraints, this is not possible because it would place x in a more arbitrary relationship with y.
   c. If x starts to the left of z and ends within z on the x-axis (infx(x) < infx(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), this is also not directly derivable from our given constraints.
   d. If x starts within z and ends to the right of z on the x-axis (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) > supx(z)), then, considering the y-axis constraints, x E z would still be the applicable relation.

I think I've been making a mistake in my analysis. Let me rethink this problem. The key issue is that cardinal direction relations are defined in terms of bounding boxes of regions. So, we need to be careful about the exact constraints provided by the given relations.

Let's revisit the problem:

Region x is E of region y, and region y is W of region z.

From these, we can derive the following constraints:

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y on the x-axis)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's minimum on the y-axis is less than or equal to x's minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's maximum on the y-axis is less than or equal to y's maximum)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's minimum on the y-axis is less than or equal to y's minimum)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's maximum on the y-axis is less than or equal to z's maximum)

Combining these constraints:

For the x-axis:
- y is to the left of both x and z.
- We can't directly determine the relationship between x and z on the x-axis based on these constraints.

For the y-axis:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
- This means z's y-extent contains y's y-extent, which contains x's y-extent.

Now, let's determine all the possible relations between x and z:

For x E z to be true, we'd need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's minimum on the y-axis is less than or equal to x's minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's maximum on the y-axis is less than or equal to z's maximum)

From our derived constraints, the second and third conditions for x E z are satisfied. The first condition, however, isn't determined directly. But it could be satisfied, making x E z a possible relation.

For x W z to be true, we'd need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's minimum on the y-axis is less than or equal to x's minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's maximum on the y-axis is less than or equal to z's maximum)

The second and third conditions are satisfied from our derived constraints. But the first condition, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), would imply that x is to the left of z. We know that y is to the left of z, and x is to the right of y. It's still possible for x to be to the left of z (if the regions are positioned in such a way that y, x, and z are positioned from left to right), but without any further constraints, we can't directly determine this.

For x B z to be true, we'd need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's minimum on the x-axis is less than or equal to x's minimum)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's maximum on the x-axis is less than or equal to z's maximum)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's minimum on the y-axis is less than or equal to x's minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's maximum on the y-axis is less than or equal to z's maximum)

The last two conditions are satisfied from our derived constraints. The first two conditions would mean that x's x-extent is contained within z's x-extent. This is not directly determined from our given relations, but it's a possible configuration.

For x N z to be true, we'd need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z on the y-axis)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's minimum on the x-axis is less than or equal to x's minimum)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's maximum on the x-axis is less than or equal to z's maximum)

But this contradicts our derived constraint that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so x N z is not possible.

Wait, I'm approaching this wrong again. Let's be more clear about the constraints and the possible relations:

From x E y and y W z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y on the x-axis)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's minimum on the y-axis is less than or equal to x's minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's maximum on the y-axis is less than or equal to y's maximum)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's minimum on the y-axis is less than or equal to y's minimum)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's maximum on the y-axis is less than or equal to z's maximum)

From these, we can derive:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (z's y-minimum ≤ y's y-minimum ≤ x's y-minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-maximum ≤ y's y-maximum ≤ z's y-maximum)

On the x-axis, we know that y is to the left of both x and z. But the relationship between x and z on the x-axis isn't directly determined.

With these constraints, let's go through all possible cardinal direction relations to determine which ones are compatible:

1. B (bounding box): For x B z, we need z's bounding box to contain x's bounding box. The y-axis constraints are compatible (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), but on the x-axis, we'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which aren't directly determined. So, x B z is possible.

2. N (North): For x N z, we need x to be above z on the y-axis (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) and their x-bounds to overlap in a specific way. But our derived constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) doesn't guarantee supy(z) ≤ infy(x). In fact, the constraints suggest otherwise. So, x N z is not possible.

3. S (South): Similarly, for x S z, we'd need x to be below z on the y-axis (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), which again isn't compatible with our derived constraints. So, x S z is not possible.

4. E (East): For x E z, we need x to be to the right of z on the x-axis (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and their y-bounds to overlap in a specific way. The y-bounds part is compatible with our derived constraints. The x-axis constraint isn't directly determined but is a possible configuration. So, x E z is possible.

5. W (West): For x W z, we need x to be to the left of z on the x-axis (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and their y-bounds to overlap in a specific way. The y-bounds part is compatible with our derived constraints. But for the x-axis, if y is to the left of z and x is to the right of y, can x still be to the left of z? Yes, it's possible if the regions are arranged in such a way. So, x W z is possible too.

6. NE (North East): For x NE z, we need x to be to the right of z on the x-axis (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and above z on the y-axis (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). The x-axis part can be satisfied, but the y-axis part contradicts our derived constraints. So, x NE z is not possible.

7. NW (North West): For x NW z, we need x to be to the left of z on the x-axis (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and above z on the y-axis (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). The y-axis part contradicts our derived constraints. So, x NW z is not possible.

8. SE (South East): For x SE z, we need x to be to the right of z on the x-axis (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and below z on the y-axis (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)). The y-axis part again contradicts our derived constraints. So, x SE z is not possible.

9. SW (South West): Similar to SE, the y-axis constraint for SW contradicts our derived constraints. So, x SW z is not possible.

From this analysis, it seems that the possible relations between x and z given the constraints are B, E, and W. But I'm not entirely sure about the W relation. Let me double-check my logic:

From x E y and y W z, we have y to the left of both x and z. If x is to the left of z, then the arrangement would be y, then x, then z from left to right. But we're told that x is to the right of y. This doesn't necessarily exclude the possibility of x W z, but it seems like the most natural arrangement would have x to the right of z, making the E relation more likely. But without further constraints, we can't rule out the W relation.

Actually, I think I was mistaken. Given our derived constraints, it's not possible for x to be to the left of z (i.e., x W z) if x is to the right of y and y is to the left of z.

Let's trace through this: From x E y, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x). From y W z, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(z). But we can't directly determine the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z) from these. So, both configurations: x to the left of z and x to the right of z, could be compatible with the given relations.

Wait, I think I'm continuing to make errors in my reasoning. Let's reason through this problem from the beginning.

We're told:
1. x E y: This means region x is to the east of region y, so x is completely to the right of y on the x-axis and y's y-extent contains x's y-extent.
2. y W z: This means region y is to the west of region z, so y is completely to the left of z on the x-axis and z's y-extent contains y's y-extent.

From these, we can't directly infer the cardinal direction relation between x and z without any additional information. The regions could be arranged in various ways that satisfy the given relations.

For x E z to be true, x would need to be completely to the right of z on the x-axis and z's y-extent would need to contain x's y-extent. We know that x is to the right of y and y is to the left of z, but we don't know the exact positions. So, x E z is a possibility, but not a guarantee.

Similarly, for x W z to be true, x would need to be completely to the left of z on the x-axis and z's y-extent would need to contain x's y-extent. Given that x is to the right of y and y is to the left of z, it's not immediately clear if x can be to the left of z.

Let's try to reason more carefully. From x E y, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x). From y W z, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(z). This gives us:
supx(y) ≤ min(infx(x), infx(z))

This doesn't tell us anything about the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or about the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

For the y-axis: From x E y, we have infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y). From y W z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This gives us:
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

So, z's y-extent contains y's y-extent, which contains x's y-extent.

Let me draw a possible arrangement to help clarify:

```
    z   
  y   x
```

In this arrangement, x is to the right of y, y is to the left of z, and x is to the "southeast" of z. But there are other possible arrangements too:

```
z
  y
    x
```

In this arrangement, x is to the right of y, y is to the left of z, and x is to the "east" of z.

Wait, the arrangement in the first drawing would be the SE relation, which I determined isn't possible based on our constraints. Let me reconsider...

Ah, I think I see where my reasoning went wrong. The y-axis in geometry typically has positive values going up. If I draw it out:

```
^
|
+---->
```

So, for the SE relation, we would need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x's y-maximum is less than or equal to z's y-minimum, meaning x is below z)

The first condition is a possibility given our constraints, but the second condition contradicts our derived constraint: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x's y-minimum is greater than or equal to z's y-minimum, not less than.

Actually, I believe I was approaching this problem correctly earlier. Let's see if I can clarify things by examining the specific constraints imposed by each cardinal direction relation.

From our given relations:
- x E y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we've derived:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let's examine the constraints imposed by each cardinal direction relation for x R z (where R is a cardinal direction):

1. x B z: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - The last two conditions are already satisfied by our derived constraints.
   - The first two conditions could be satisfied, but they're not directly determined from our given relations.
   - So, x B z is a possibility.

2. x N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - The condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
   - So, x N z is not possible.

3. x S z: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - The condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts our derived constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   - So, x S z is not possible.

4. x E z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - The last two conditions are already satisfied by our derived constraints.
   - The first condition is not directly determined, but it's a possibility.
   - So, x E z is a possibility.

5. x W z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - The last two conditions are already satisfied by our derived constraints.
   - The first condition, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), would mean x is completely to the left of z.
   - We know that x is to the right of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) and y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).
   - It's possible for x to be to the left of z even if x is to the right of y and y is to the left of z, as long as x and z's positions on the x-axis are appropriate.
   - So, x W z is a possibility.

6. x NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - The second condition, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
   - So, x NE z is not possible.

7. x NW z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - Again, the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts our derived constraint.
   - So, x NW z is not possible.

8. x SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts our derived constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   - So, x SE z is not possible.

9. x SW z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) again contradicts our derived constraint.
   - So, x SW z is not possible.

Based on the above analysis, the possible relations between x and z given the constraints are B, E, and W.

Actually, wait. Let me double-check the W relation. If x is to the right of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) and y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), can x still be to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z))?

Let's see if these constraints can be satisfied simultaneously:
supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

Yes, these can be satisfied, for instance if the regions are positioned like:
```
      z
  y x
```
Where y is to the left, x is in the middle, and z is to the right.

But wait, for x W z, we'd need x to be completely to the left of z. If z is to the right, then x would need to be completely to the left of z, which contradicts the earlier arrangement.

Ok, I think I was right in my initial assessment. Let me approach this problem methodically.

If x E y and y W z, then:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)

From these, we can derive a relationship: supx(y) ≤ min(infx(x), infx(z)). But that doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between x and z on the x-axis.

For the y-axis, we derived:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Which means z's y-extent contains y's y-extent, which contains x's y-extent.

For x W z to be true, we'd need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which would mean x is completely to the left of z. We know that x is to the right of y and y is to the left of z. Let's test if all these constraints can be satisfied simultaneously:

- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (for x W z)

The first two constraints are already given. The third is what we want to test. One arrangement that satisfies these is:
```
   x  z
y
```
Where y's x-extent is completely to the left of both x and z, and x's x-extent is completely to the left of z's.

Another arrangement could be:
```
    z
y x
```
Where again, y's x-extent is completely to the left of both x and z, and x's x-extent is completely to the left of z's.

So, it is possible for x W z to be true.

Now, for x E z to be true, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which would mean x is completely to the right of z. Again, let's test if these constraints can be satisfied simultaneously:

- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (for x E z)

The first two constraints are already given. The third is what we're testing. One arrangement that satisfies these is:
```
    x
  z
y
```
Where y's x-extent is completely to the left of both z and x, and z's x-extent is completely to the left of x's.

Another arrangement could be:
```
      x
y z
```
Where again, y's x-extent is completely to the left of both z and x, and z's x-extent is completely to the left of x's.

So, it is possible for x E z to be true.

Lastly, for x B z to be true, we'd need z's bounding box to contain x's bounding box. This means:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's x-minimum ≤ x's x-minimum)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-maximum ≤ z's x-maximum)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's y-minimum ≤ x's y-minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-maximum ≤ z's y-maximum)

We've already derived that infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), so the y-axis constraints for x B z are satisfied. For the x-axis, the arrangement could be:
```
   z
  y x
```
Where y's x-extent is to the left of both x and z, and x's x-extent is contained within z's.

So, x B z is also a possible relation.

Given all the above, the possible relations between x and z are B, E, and W.

Ok, I think I need to be extremely careful with the logic here. Let's double-check the W relation once more:

For x W z to be true, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's minimum on the y-axis is less than or equal to x's minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's maximum on the y-axis is less than or equal to z's maximum)

The last two conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints. The question is whether supx(x) ≤ infx(z) can hold, given that:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)

From the above, we know that both x and z start to the right of y's end. But without further constraints, we can't determine if x is to the left of z, to the right of z, or if they overlap on the x-axis. So, it's possible for x W z to be true.

Hmm, there's another angle to consider. For x W z to be true, we need x to be completely to the left of z on the x-axis, meaning supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Let's combine our constraints:

From x E y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

For x W z to be true, we'd need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

From supx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(y) < supx(x), which means y is to the left of x or at most overlaps with x partially on the x-axis.

From y W z, we know that y is completely to the left of z on the x-axis.

If x is to the right of y, and y is completely to the left of z, then it's possible for x to be completely to the left of z?

Wait, let me draw it out:

```
     z
  y x
```

Here, x is to the right of y, and both are below z. Y is completely to the left of z. And while x is to the right of y, it's also completely to the left of z on the x-axis, meaning x W z is true.

But, there's a simpler way to test this. Let's assign specific values to the bounds of the regions:

infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 2
infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7
infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4

These values satisfy our conditions:
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 3 (x is to the right of y on the x-axis)
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 5 (y is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supx(x) = 4 ≤ infx(z) = 5 (x is to the left of z on the x-axis, which is what we need for x W z)

So, x W z is a possible relationship.

Similarly, for x E z to be true, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's minimum on the y-axis is less than or equal to x's minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's maximum on the y-axis is less than or equal to z's maximum)

The last two conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints. We need to test if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) can hold given our known constraints.

Let's assign specific values to test this:

infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 2
infx(z) = 3, supx(z) = 5
infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 8

These values satisfy our conditions:
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 6 (x is to the right of y on the x-axis)
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 3 (y is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supx(z) = 5 ≤ infx(x) = 6 (x is to the right of z on the x-axis, which is what we need for x E z)

So, x E z is also a possible relationship.

For x B z to be true, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's x-minimum ≤ x's x-minimum)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-maximum ≤ z's x-maximum)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's y-minimum ≤ x's y-minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-maximum ≤ z's y-maximum)

The last two conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints. Let's test if the first two can be satisfied:

Let's assign specific values:

infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 2
infx(z) = 3, supx(z) = 8
infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 6

These values satisfy our conditions:
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 4 (x is to the right of y on the x-axis)
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 3 (y is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- infx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(x) = 4 (z's x-minimum ≤ x's x-minimum)
- supx(x) = 6 ≤ supx(z) = 8 (x's x-maximum ≤ z's x-maximum)

So, x B z is also a possible relationship.

Given all the above, the possible relations between x and z are B, E, and W.

Actually, I think due to our constraints on the y-axis, a lot of the cardinal direction relations will also be possible.

Let's check if x NE z could be possible. For this, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the x-axis)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z on the y-axis)

The first condition can be satisfied as we've shown. But the second condition contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then it's not possible for supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

Let's check x NW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z on the y-axis)

The first condition can be satisfied, but the second contradicts our derived constraint. So, x NW z is not possible.

Let's check x SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z on the y-axis)

The first condition can be satisfied, but the second contradicts our derived constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x). If infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then it's not possible for supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x SE z is not possible.

Finally, let's check x SW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z on the y-axis)

Again, the first condition can be satisfied, but the second contradicts our derived constraint. So, x SW z is not possible.

Let's check x N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z on the y-axis)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's x-minimum ≤ x's x-minimum)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-maximum ≤ z's x-maximum)

The last two conditions can be satisfied, but the first contradicts our derived constraint. So, x N z is not possible.

Lastly, let's check x S z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z on the y-axis)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's x-minimum ≤ x's x-minimum)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-maximum ≤ z's x-maximum)

The last two conditions can be satisfied, but the first contradicts our derived constraint. So, x S z is not possible.

Based on all the above checks, the possible relations between x and z given our constraints are B, E, and W.

I think I'm going to double-check the W relation one more time, as I want to be certain.

For x W z to be true, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x's x-maximum ≤ z's x-minimum)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's y-minimum ≤ x's y-minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-maximum ≤ z's y-maximum)

The last two conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints.

Given our constraints:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)

We need to determine if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) can be satisfied along with these.

If supx(y) ≤ infx(x), then for certain values x can be entirely to the right of y.
If supx(y) ≤ infx(z), then for certain values z can be entirely to the right of y.

But now it depends on the relative positions of x and z. They can be arranged such that x is to the left of z, or such that x overlaps with z, or such that x is to the right of z, all while keeping both of them to the right of y.

Here's a specific arrangement that satisfies our constraints and has x W z:

```
     z
  y x
```

With values:
- y: (0, 2) on the x-axis
- x: (3, 4) on the x-axis
- z: (5, 7) on the x-axis

These values satisfy:
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 3 (from x E y)
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 5 (from y W z)
- supx(x) = 4 ≤ infx(z) = 5 (for x W z)

So x W z is a possible relation.

Given all the checks I've done, the possible relations between x and z based on the given constraints are B, E, and W.

Actually wait, I just realized there's one more thing I need to check. For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's x-minimum ≤ x's x-minimum)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-maximum ≤ z's x-maximum)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's y-minimum ≤ x's y-minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-maximum ≤ z's y-maximum)

I've already shown that all of these conditions can be satisfied with specific values, making x B z a possible relation.

And for completeness, let's check the B relation one more time with a concrete example:

With values:
- y: (0, 2) on the x-axis
- x: (4, 6) on the x-axis
- z: (3, 8) on the x-axis

These values satisfy:
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 4 (from x E y)
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 3 (from y W z)
- infx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(x) = 4 (for the first condition of x B z)
- supx(x) = 6 ≤ supx(z) = 8 (for the second condition of x B z)

And on the y-axis, we have:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (z's y-minimum ≤ y's y-minimum ≤ x's y-minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-maximum ≤ y's y-maximum ≤ z's y-maximum)

These satisfy the remaining conditions for x B z.

Given all of the above, the possible relations between x and z based on the given constraints are B, E, and W.

In summary, for the constraints "x E y" and "y W z", I found out that the possible relations between x and z are:
- x B z
- x E z
- x W z

Let me double-check my logic for the E relation too:

For x E z to be true, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's x-maximum ≤ x's x-minimum)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's y-minimum ≤ x's y-minimum)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-maximum ≤ z's y-maximum)

The last two conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints. We need to determine if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) can be satisfied in addition.

Given our constraints:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)

We already know that both x and z are to the right of y. But, as with the W relation, the relative positions of x and z can vary.

Let's consider a specific arrangement:

```
      x
  y z
```

With values:
- y: (0, 2) on the x-axis
- z: (3, 5) on the x-axis
- x: (6, 8) on the x-axis

These values satisfy:
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 6 (from x E y)
- supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 3 (from y W z)
- supx(z) = 5 ≤ infx(x) = 6 (for x E z)

So x E z is a possible relation.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z based on the constraints "x E y" and "y W z" are B, E, and W.

So my final answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are: B, E, W.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

B, E, W

This is because:

1. From "x E y": we know supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
2. From "y W z": we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, we can derive for the y-axis:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For the x-axis, we know y is to the left of both x and z, but the relationship between x and z isn't directly determined.

Therefore:
- B is possible (x inside z's bounding box)
- E is possible (x entirely to the east of z)
- W is possible (x entirely to the west of z)

The other cardinal directions aren't possible because they all violate the y-axis constraints we derived.
