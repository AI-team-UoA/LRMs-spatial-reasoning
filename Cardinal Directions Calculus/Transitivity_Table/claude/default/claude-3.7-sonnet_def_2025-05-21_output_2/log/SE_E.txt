PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that x is SE of y, which means that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).

We also know that y is E of z, which means supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's analyze the x-coordinates. We have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x SE y]
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [from y E z]

By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). So, supx(z) <= infx(x).

This means that x is either E, NE, or SE of z, as these are the only relations where the x-coordinate of x is strictly to the east of the x-coordinate of z.

Now, let's analyze the y-coordinates. We have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [from y E z]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [from y E z]

From the first two inequalities, we can say supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but we can't directly relate supy(x) and infy(z).

Let's consider all possible cases:

1. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z.
2. If infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.
3. If supy(z) <= supy(x), then we have more cases to consider:
   a. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NE of z.
   b. If infy(x) <= supy(z), then it gets more complex...

Actually, I notice that I've been reasoning too complexly. Let me simplify.

We know x is SE of y, which means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

And y is E of z, which means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [y is to the east of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z) [y's y-coordinates are contained within z's]

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) [by transitivity]
  This means x is to the east of z.

Now, for the y-coordinates, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [from y E z]

We can't directly determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from the given constraints. But we can have three cases:

1. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z.
2. If infy(z) < supy(x) AND infy(x) <= supy(z), then x overlaps with z in the y-direction, which means x is E of z.
3. If supy(z) < infy(x), then x is NE of z.

Let me visualize these cases to confirm.

Case 1: x is SE of z.
```
   z
     \
      y
        \
         x
```

Case 2: x is E of z.
```
   z---
     \  |
      y |
        \|
         x
```

Case 3: x is NE of z.
```
         x
        /|
      y |
     /  |
   z---
```

Actually, let me double-check by looking at the constraints provided for these regions:

For x SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of z]
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [x is to the south of z]

For x E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z) [x's y-coordinates are contained within z's]

For x NE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(x) [x is to the north of z]

From our earlier reasoning, we showed that supx(z) <= infx(x), meaning x is to the east of z. This is consistent with x being SE, E, or NE of z.

For the y-coordinates, we had:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [from y E z]

These constraints don't give us a clear relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between infy(x) and supy(z). Therefore, all three cases I mentioned earlier (x SE z, x E z, x NE z) are possible.

Actually, come to think of it, I should also check if there's a possibility of x being IN z (i.e., B). For x B z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) [x's x-coordinates are contained within z's]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z) [x's y-coordinates are contained within z's]

But from our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), we know that x is strictly to the east of z. This contradicts the constraint for IN, which would require infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be IN z.

I need to check if there are other possibilities. Let's examine the constraints for S, SW, W, and NW:

For x S of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) [x's x-coordinates are contained within z's]
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [x is to the south of z]

From our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), we see that x's x-coordinates are not contained within z's. Thus, x cannot be S of z.

For x SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) [x is to the west of z]
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [x is to the south of z]

Again, from our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), we see that x is to the east of z, not to the west. Thus, x cannot be SW of z.

For x W of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) [x is to the west of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z) [x's y-coordinates are contained within z's]

From our derived constraint, x is to the east of z, not to the west. Thus, x cannot be W of z.

For x NW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) [x is to the west of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(x) [x is to the north of z]

Again, from our derived constraint, x is to the east of z, not to the west. Thus, x cannot be NW of z.

So, from all the cardinal directions, the only possible relations between region x and region z are SE, E, and NE.

Actually, I'm realizing now that I should also consider the possibility of combinations of relations. Let me think about that.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating. When we say that x is SE of y, it means that x must completely lie in the southeast direction of y. And similarly for y being E of z. Given these two conditions, x must be to the east of z, but its vertical position relative to z can be southeast, east, or northeast.

Let me double-check with a clearer example. Imagine a grid:

```
| | |z| |
| | |y| |
| | | |x|
```

Here, x is SE of y and y is E of z. And in this case, x is SE of z.

Now, let's try another grid:

```
| | | |x|
| | |y| |
| | |z| |
```

Here, x is NE of y and y is E of z. And in this case, x is NE of z.

And one more:

```
| | |z| |
| | |y|x|
| | | | |
```

Here, x is E of y and y is E of z. And in this case, x is E of z.

Wait, no, I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify the relations:

For x SE of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

For y E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z)

The vertical component of the "E" relation is that the y-coordinates of the east region are contained within the y-coordinates of the west region.

Let me re-examine the relation between x and z:

For the x-coordinates: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [from y E z]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [from y E z]

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

But we can't directly relate supy(x) and infy(z) from these constraints.

If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z.
If infy(z) < supy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(z), then x overlaps with z in the y-direction, meaning x is E of z.
If supy(z) < infy(x), then x is NE of z.

Since all three cases are consistent with the given constraints, the possible relations between region x and region z are SE, E, and NE.

Wait, I think in this problem the relation is "SE" which means South-East, not "SE" as in Standard East. Let me reconsider. Actually, I think I've been using the right interpretation.

Per the definitions provided:
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

This means that SE stands for "South East" and indicates that a is to the southeast of b.

So, let's clarify the constraints again:

For x SE of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

For y E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [y is to the east of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z) [y's y-coordinates are contained within z's]

From these, we've determined that x is to the east of z. But its position with respect to the y-coordinates of z can vary, allowing x to be SE, E, or NE of z.

Let me draw it to be sure:

Suppose we have a grid centered around z:

```
    z
   /|
  / |
 /  |
y   |
 \  |
  \ |
   \|
    x
```

In this case, x is SE of y and y is E of z. And x is SE of z.

But I can also draw it this way:

```
    x
   /|
  / |
 /  |
y   |
 \  |
  \ |
   \|
    z
```

Here, x is SE of y and y is E of z. And x is NE of z.

And also:

```
    z
   /|
  / |
 /  |
y  x
 \  |
  \ |
   \|
```

In this case, x is SE of y and y is E of z. And x is E of z.

All three arrangements are consistent with the given constraints (x SE y and y E z). This confirms that x can be SE, E, or NE of z.

But wait. Let's double-check by looking at the constraints for x in relation to z in each case:

Case 1: x is SE of z.
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of z]
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [x is to the south of z]

Case 2: x is E of z.
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z) [x's y-coordinates are contained within z's]

Case 3: x is NE of z.
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(x) [x is to the north of z]

From our derived constraints, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of z]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [from y E z]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [from y E z]

Let's check if each case is consistent with these derived constraints:

Case 1 (x SE z): For x to be SE of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). But from the derived constraints, we only know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). We can't deduce supy(x) <= infy(z) from these.

So, I can't be sure if Case 1 (x SE z) is a possible relation without more information.

Oops, on second thought I think I might be getting confused by the ordering. Let me carefully evaluate here. For region x to be SE of region z, we want:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From x SE y and y E z, we've already derived supx(z) <= infx(x). For SE, we need to also check supy(x) <= infy(z).

But, from x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and from y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y).

From these two, we can't deduce supy(x) <= infy(z). In fact, if infy(z) < infy(y), it's possible for infy(z) < supy(x) <= infy(y). This would mean x would not be to the south of z.

So, it's not always the case that x is SE of z.

Let me double-check the other cases too:

Case 2 (x E z): For x to be E of z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [which we've established]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the derived constraints, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). So, supy(x) <= supy(z). But we don't have a direct relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).

However, given y's vertical position between x and z (infy(x) >= infy(y) follows from the definition of cardinal directions), and infy(z) <= infy(y), we can derive infy(z) <= infy(x).

So, x could be E of z.

Actually, hold on. I'm getting confused by the definitions. Let me really use the original definition and test case-by-case to see what relations are possible.

For x to be SE of z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

For x to be E of z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)

For x to be NE of z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our derived constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x). Let's see the possible vertical relationships.

From x SE y, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y E z, we know:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining, we get:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

For x to be SE of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). From the derived constraints, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). But we can't deduce supy(x) <= infy(z).

Actually wait, that's wrong. I need to be careful. From x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y). And from y E z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z).

The fact that infy(z) <= infy(y) doesn't tell us about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, we can't determine if supy(x) <= infy(z) from the given information. It might be the case, or it might not be.

Therefore, from the given constraints, we can't definitively say x is SE of z.

For x to be E of z, we'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). From the derived constraints, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). So, supy(x) <= supy(z).

But we don't have a direct relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).

For x to be NE of z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). From the derived constraints, we know supy(y) <= supy(z). But we don't have a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

Really, all I can confidently determined is that x is to the east of z. Its vertical position (south, equally aligned, or north of z) depends on the horizontal position of the three regions. Since the constraints allow for x to be to the southeast of y and y to be to the east of z, it's possible for x to be to the southeast, east, or northeast of z depending on the specific spatial arrangement.

Ok, I've been having a bit of a hard time wrapping my head around this, so let me think outside the "definitions" and proceed via examples.

Let's say we have the following grid with three points:

```
  z
  |
  |
  y
  |
  |
  x
```

In this case, x is S of y, which doesn't match our constraints.

Actually, I think I've been getting a little confused, so I should reconsider from the beginning.

Let me be careful about the definition of SE. From the provided definition, a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

For the direction E, a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Now, let's define the relations:

For x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For y E z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Let's combine these constraints to see the relationship between x and z:

For the east-west relationship, we have:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

This clearly implies supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

There's no direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from these constraints. It's possible for supy(x) to be less than, equal to, or greater than infy(z). Similarly, there's no direct relationship between supx(y) and infy(x).

This means that x could be to the south of, aligned with (in terms of vertical coordinates), or to the north of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are E (if x's vertical range overlaps with z's), SE (if x is to the south of z), and NE (if x is to the north of z).

Actually, this is what I've been confused about: Let's reconsider the problem using the constraints we're given.

x is SE of y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

y is E of z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [y is to the east of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z) [y's vertical range is contained within z's]

From these, we can directly infer:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) [by transitivity]
  This means x is to the east of z.

For the vertical relationships, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [from y E z]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [from y E z]

Now, let's consider the possible relations:

1. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) [we've established this]
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   We have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but we can't determine supy(x) <= infy(z) without more information. It's possible, depending on the arrangement.

2. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) [we've established this]
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z). But for infy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have enough constraints to derive it.

3. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) [we've established this]
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   We know supy(y) <= supy(z), but there's no direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

Given the constraints, all three relations (SE, E, NE) are possible, depending on the specific vertical positions of the regions.

Actually, looking at it again, I think I see the problem more simply.

The constraint from x SE y is that supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of y. Similarly, from y E z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y), meaning y is to the east of z. By transitivity, x is to the east of z.

Now, for the vertical relationships, x SE y tells us supy(x) <= infy(y). And y E z tells us that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means that y's vertical range is contained within z's vertical range.

I think where I've gotten confused is in the relationship between x and z's vertical ranges.

Let me visualize this with a concrete example:

```
   z
   |
 --+--
   |
   y
   |
   |
   x
```

In this arrangement:
- x is SE of y
- y is E of z
- x is SE of z (because it's to the east and to the south of z)

But I can also have this arrangement:

```
   z
   |
   y
   |
   |
   x
```

In this case:
- x is SE of y
- y is E of z
- x is E of z (because it overlaps with z's vertical range)

And also this arrangement:

```
   |
   x
   |
   y
   |
   z
```

Here:
- x is SE of y
- y is E of z
- x is NE of z (because it's to the east and to the north of z)

Given the constraints, all three arrangements are possible. Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are SE, E, and NE.

Hmm, I think what I'm having a very hard time with is distinguishing when a constraint allows for something versus when a constraint guarantees something. I do think we have the right relations, but let me recheck.

Let's double-check. Our constraints are:
- x is SE of y means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
- y is E of z means supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

For the x-coordinates, we can derive supx(z) <= infx(x) by transitivity. This tells us that x is to the east of z.

Now, for the y-coordinates, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) from x SE y.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) from y E z.

I said in my earlier analysis that all three relations SE, E, and NE are possible. Let's validate each with a concrete arrangement.

For x SE z:
```
   z
   |
   y
   |
   x
```
Conditions:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z, needed for x SE z)

Is this arrangement consistent with the conditions? Yes, because in this arrangement, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). And I've positioned x such that supy(x) <= infy(z). (actually I think the image is off; x shouuld be to the south east of y. But the conditions are consistent)

For x E z:
```
   z
   |
 --+--
   y
 --+--
   x
```
Conditions:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (needed for x E z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (needed for x E z)

Is this arrangement consistent with the conditions? Let's check: In this arrangement, we've positioned z, y, and x from west to east. We've made sure that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (i.e., y's vertical range is contained within z's). We've positioned x to the south of y (supy(x) <= infy(y)). And we've made sure infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Thus, x is E of z.

I think I see the issue. If from x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y), and from y E z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y), then we can derive supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). But we could have infy(z) > supy(x) or infy(z) <= supy(x).

If infy(z) > supy(x), then x is to the south of z (since supy(x) < infy(z)), and given that x is to the east of z, x would be SE of z.

If infy(z) <= supy(x), then x overlaps with z in the y-direction, or x could be to the north of z (if supy(z) <= infy(x)). In the overlapping case, x is E of z. In the case where x is to the north of z, x would be NE of z.

So, depending on the specific values, x can be SE, E, or NE of z.

Actually, I'll also draw a third arrangement to verify NE:

For x NE z:
```
   x
   |
   y
   |
   z
```
Conditions:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (needed for x NE z)

Is this arrangement consistent with the conditions? In this setup, I've positioned z, y, and x from west to east. I've adjusted the vertical positions such that supy(z) <= infy(x). But there's an issue now: if x is to the north of y (infy(x) >= supy(y)), then x can't be to the south of y (supy(x) <= infy(y)), which is what x SE y implies.

actually wait. I think I could have mis-drawn my figure. Let's say:
```
   x
   |
   |
   y
   |
   z
```
Hmm, but that doesn't make sense either because then y couldn't be to the east of z. 

I think this is wrong: "supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)". I think this is a mis-interpretation. x SE y really means that x is in the south EAST direction of y, not that x is to the south of y. The actual definition says a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Rethinking:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y) -> correct, sorry for the confusion.

Let's try the arrangement again for x NE z:
```
   x
   |
   |
   y
   |
   |
   z
```
Actually, I realize that I've been trying to visualize a situation where x is NE of z, but I'm constraining x to be SE of y. But this is a contradiction. Hmm, I think I need to visualize this differently. 

Actually, I think I'm getting confused by the image. Let's revert to constraints.

Ok we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y), which means x is SE of y.
- supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means y is E of z.

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (by transitivity), so x is to the east of z.
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but we can't determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
- supy(y) <= supy(z), so we know that z extends at least as far north as y.

Now, when I said that all three relations (SE, E, NE) are possible, I had visualized concrete arrangements for each:

For x SE z, I'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). Given the constraints, this is possible if infy(z) >= supy(x).

For x E z, I'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). From the constraints, we know supy(x) <= infy(y). So, if infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(y) >= supy(x), then x could be E of z.

For x NE z, I'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). From the constraints, supy(y) <= supy(z). So, if infy(x) >= supy(z) >= supy(y), then x could be NE of z. But, we also have x SE y, which means supy(x) <= infy(y). Thus, for x to be NE of z, we'd need infy(x) >= supy(z) and supy(x) <= infy(y). This seems possible. For instance, infy(x) = 10, supx(x) = 5, supx(z) = 9, infy(y) = 6.

Wait, this doesn't seem right. If x is to the north of z (which is what NE implies) and y is between x and z in the east-west direction, then how can x be to the south of y (which is what SE implies)?

Let me try to draw it. We have:
- x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x)).
- x is to the south of y (supy(x) <= infy(y)).
- y is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(y)).
- y's vertical range is contained within z's (infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)).

Let's visualize:
```
   z
   |
   y
   |
   x
```

In this arrangement, x is to the east of y, which is to the east of z. y's vertical range is contained within z's, and x is to the south of y. This would make x SE of z.

I could also have:
```
   z
   |
 --+--
   y
 --+--
   x
```

Here, x is to the east of y, which is to the east of z. y's vertical range is contained within z's, and x is to the south of y. This would make x E of z with vertical overlap.

For the third case (x NE z), I need to position x such that it's to the north of z, while being to the south of y. This seems contradictory.

Actually, I need to be precise. For x to be SE of y, x should be to the south-east of y. That doesn't necessarily mean that x is directly south of y, but that it's in the south-east direction.

Let me try to draw again:
```
    z
    |
    y
   /
  /
 x
```

In this arrangement, x is to the south-east of y, y is to the east of z, and x is to the south-east of z.

For the second case (x E z):
```
    z
    |
    y
    |
    x
```

Here, x is to the south-east of y, y is to the east of z, and x is to the east of z with no vertical displacement.

And for the third case (x NE z):
```
      x
     /
    /
   y
   |
   z
```

In this arrangement, x is to the south-east of y (a bit more to the east than to the south), y is to the east of z, and x is to the north-east of z.

Wait, this still doesn't seem right for the third case. If x is to the south-east of y and y is directly to the east of z, then how can x be to the north-east of z?

Let me be precise with the constraints again. For x to be NE of z, I'd need supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x should be to the north of z. But for x to be SE of y, I'd need supy(x) <= infy(y), which means x should be to the south of y. If y is E of z, then y's vertical range is contained within z's, which means y is neither to the north nor south of z (there's vertical overlap). For x to be to the north of z while being to the south of y, y would need to be to the north of z, which contradicts y being E of z.

But maybe my interpretation is too rigid. Being "to the north" or "to the south" in the context of regions (rather than points) might allow for some vertical overlap. Let me re-examine the definitions:

For x NE of z, I'd need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This doesn't necessarily mean that the entire region x is to the north of the entire region z, but that the lowest point of x is above the highest point of z.

Similarly, for x SE of y, I'd need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y). This doesn't mean the entire region x is to the south of the entire region y, but that the highest point of x is below the lowest point of y.

With these interpretations, it's indeed possible for x to be NE of z, despite being SE of y.

Let's envision a simple example:
- Let's say z's bounds are [0, 10] in the y-direction.
- y's bounds are [2, 8] in the y-direction (note that y's vertical range is contained within z's, as required for y E z).
- x's bounds are [9, 11] in the y-direction.

With these bounds, supy(x) (11) <= infy(y) (2) doesn't hold, so x can't be SE of y. But supy(z) (10) <= infy(x) (9) does hold, so x could be NE of z.

Wait, I made a mistake. For x to be SE of y, the condition is supy(x) <= infy(y). This means the highest point of x is below the lowest point of y. With the bounds I gave, supy(x) (11) is greater than infy(y) (2), so x can't be SE of y.

I'm sorry for the confusion. Let me re-adjust the bounds.

- Let's say z's bounds are [0, 10] in the y-direction.
- y's bounds are [2, 8] in the y-direction (note that y's vertical range is contained within z's, as required for y E z).
- x's bounds are [0, 1] in the y-direction.

With these bounds, supy(x) (1) <= infy(y) (2), so x is SE of y. But supy(z) (10) <= infy(x) (0) doesn't hold, so x can't be NE of z. In fact, with these bounds, x would be SE of z.

I think I need to re-consider the problem carefully. I'm trying to find a scenario where x can be NE of z despite being SE of y. Let's set up the bounds again.

For x to be SE of y, I'd need supy(x) <= infy(y). For x to be NE of z, I'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). And for y to be E of z, I'd need infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Hmm, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(x), so by transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(y). But for y to be E of z, we'd need infy(z) <= infy(y). Together, infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y) imply that the entire region z is below the lowest point of y. This doesn't match the requirement for y to be E of z, which would expect a vertical overlap between z and y.

Actually, there's a lot of confusion on my part. Let me think more carefully here.

x SE y means x is to the south and east of y.
y E z means y is to the east of z (without any north/south component).

This certainly means that x is to the east of z (through transitivity). But the question is: how does x position vertically with respect to z?

For y E z, y's vertical range is contained within z's vertical range. If x is to the south of y, then x is also to the south of some part of z. However, since z may extend further south than y, x might also overlap with z's vertical range, or even be to the north of z's lowest point.

I need to be clearer on my visualization.

SE relation: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
This means that a is to the southeast of b if the easternmost point of b is to the west of the westernmost point of a, and the northernmost point of a is to the south of the southernmost point of b.

E relation: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
This means that a is to the east of b if the easternmost point of b is to the west of the westernmost point of a, the southernmost point of b is at or to the north of the southernmost point of a, and the northernmost point of a is at or to the south of the northernmost point of b.

Given these definitions, I need to better understand the vertical relationship between x and z.

We have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) from x SE y.
- supy(x) <= infy(y) from x SE y.
- supx(z) <= infx(y) from y E z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) from y E z.
- supy(y) <= supy(z) from y E z.

From these, we can directly derive supx(z) <= infx(x) (by transitivity through y), so x is to the east of z. And there are a couple relationships we have: 
- From y E z, we know that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
- From x SE y, we know that supy(x) <= infy(y). We don't have a direct constraint between infy(x) and supy(y).

We are trying to figure out all the possible vertical alignments between x and z. In particular, let's check which cardinal relations are possible.

NE relation: a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
This means that a is to the northeast of b if the easternmost point of b is to the west of the westernmost point of a, and the northernmost point of b is to the south of the southernmost point of a.

E relation: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
This means that a is to the east of b if the easternmost point of b is to the west of the westernmost point of a, the southernmost point of b is at or to the north of the southernmost point of a, and the northernmost point of a is at or to the south of the northernmost point of b.

SE relation: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
This means that a is to the southeast of b if the easternmost point of b is to the west of the westernmost point of a, and the northernmost point of a is to the south of the southernmost point of b.

For x to be SE of z, I'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). We know that supy(x) <= infy(y) from x SE y, and infy(z) <= infy(y) from y E z. So, we could have supy(x) <= infy(z) or infy(z) < supy(x) <= infy(y).

For x to be E of z, I'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supy(x) <= infy(y) from x SE y, and supy(y) <= supy(z) from y E z. So, supy(x) <= supy(z). However, we don't have a direct constraint between infy(z) and infy(x).

For x to be NE of z, I'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(y) <= supy(z) from y E z, but don't have any direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(y) or supy(z).

Actually. Think of this problem spatially. We have:
```
  z---
    \
     y
      \
       x
```

In this arrangement, x is to the southeast of y (because it's to the south and east of y). y is to the east of z, and y's vertical range is contained within z's vertical range. Given these constraints, x can be:
1. To the southeast of z (if it's further east and south of z).
2. To the east of z (if it's directly east of z, with some vertical overlap).
3. To the northeast of z (if it's to the north of the southernmost part of z and to the east of z).

I think I was making the mistake of thinking too rigidly, where I was considering z, y, and x as points rather than regions. When thinking of them as regions, the cardinal directions become a bit more nuanced.

Rechecking SE, E, and NE one more time from our definitions.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [we've already established this]
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [we've already established this]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)

For x to be NE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [we've already established this]
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Let's analyze the constraints we've been given:
- x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

The combined constraints tell us x is to the east of z. But they don't uniquely determine the vertical relationship between x and z.

For x to be SE of z, supy(x) <= infy(z) should hold. We know supy(x) <= infy(y) from x SE y, and infy(z) <= infy(y) from y E z. But we don't know how supy(x) and infy(z) relate. It's possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) to hold, which would make x SE of z.

For x to be E of z, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) should hold. We know supy(x) <= infy(y) from x SE y, and supy(y) <= supy(z) from y E z. By transitivity, supy(x) <= supy(z). But we don't know how infy(z) and infy(x) relate. It's possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) to hold, which would make x E of z.

For x to be NE of z, supy(z) <= infy(x) should hold. We know supy(y) <= supy(z) from y E z, but we don't have direct constraints between infy(x) and supy(y) or supy(z). It's possible for supy(z) <= infy(x) to hold, which would make x NE of z.

Given these observations, all three relations (SE, E, NE) are possible between x and z.

ok, let me settle this by constructing actual examples. I have we have x SE y and y E z, and I want to check if we can have x SE z, x E z, or x NE z.

First, from definition, x SE y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

y E z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z)

For x to be SE of z, I'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [which follows from supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)]
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Example for x SE z:
- Let z's bounds be [0, 10] in the y-direction and [0, 3] in the x-direction.
- Let y's bounds be [4, 8] in the y-direction and [5, 7] in the x-direction.
- Let x's bounds be [1, 3] in the y-direction and [9, 11] in the x-direction.

Check all our constraints:

For x SE y:
- supx(y) (7) <= infx(x) (9) [✓]
- supy(x) (3) <= infy(y) (4) [✓]

For y E z:
- supx(z) (3) <= infx(y) (5) [✓]
- infy(z) (0) <= infy(y) (4) AND supy(y) (8) <= supy(z) (10) [✓]

For x SE z:
- supx(z) (3) <= infx(x) (9) [✓]
- supy(x) (3) <= infy(z) (0) [✗]

This example doesn't satisfy x SE z. Let's adjust the bounds:

- Let z's bounds be [4, 10] in the y-direction and [0, 3] in the x-direction.
- Let y's bounds be [4, 8] in the y-direction and [5, 7] in the x-direction.
- Let x's bounds be [1, 3] in the y-direction and [9, 11] in the x-direction.

Check all our constraints:

For x SE y:
- supx(y) (7) <= infx(x) (9) [✓]
- supy(x) (3) <= infy(y) (4) [✓]

For y E z:
- supx(z) (3) <= infx(y) (5) [✓]
- infy(z) (4) <= infy(y) (4) AND supy(y) (8) <= supy(z) (10) [✓]

For x SE z:
- supx(z) (3) <= infx(x) (9) [✓]
- supy(x) (3) <= infy(z) (4) [✓]

So this is consistent with x SE z.

For x to be E of z, I'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [which we've already established]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)

Example for x E z:
- Let z's bounds be [1, 10] in the y-direction and [0, 3] in the x-direction.
- Let y's bounds be [4, 8] in the y-direction and [5, 7] in the x-direction.
- Let x's bounds be [2, 3] in the y-direction and [9, 11] in the x-direction.

Check all our constraints:

For x SE y:
- supx(y) (7) <= infx(x) (9) [✓]
- supy(x) (3) <= infy(y) (4) [✓]

For y E z:
- supx(z) (3) <= infx(y) (5) [✓]
- infy(z) (1) <= infy(y) (4) AND supy(y) (8) <= supy(z) (10) [✓]

For x E z:
- supx(z) (3) <= infx(x) (9) [✓]
- infy(z) (1) <= infy(x) (2) AND supy(x) (3) <= supy(z) (10) [✓]

This example is consistent with x E z.

For x to be NE of z, I'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [which we've already established]
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Example for x NE z:
- Let z's bounds be [1, 5] in the y-direction and [0, 3] in the x-direction.
- Let y's bounds be [3, 5] in the y-direction and [5, 7] in the x-direction.
- Let x's bounds be [6, 8] in the y-direction and [9, 11] in the x-direction.

Check all our constraints:

For x SE y:
- supx(y) (7) <= infx(x) (9) [✓]
- supy(x) (8) <= infy(y) (3) [✗]

Hmm, this doesn't satisfy x SE y. We need supy(x) <= infy(y) for x SE y, which means the northernmost point of x should be to the south of the southernmost point of y. Let's adjust the bounds again...

For NE, I got caught by exactly the issue that I had identified before. If x is NE of z, and y is E of z, can x also be SE of y? Let's see if we can find a contradiction.

For x to be SE of y, we need supy(x) <= infy(y). For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). For y to be E of z, we need supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). By transitivity, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This seems to lead to a contradiction: supy(x) <= infy(x), which would mean the northernmost point of x is to the south of the southernmost point of x, which is obviously impossible unless x's vertical size is 0.

Actually, I think this is where I was getting stuck. On further reflection, I don't think x can be NE of z while being SE of y, given y E z. My answer then is that the possible relations between region x and region z are SE and E.

Actually, wait. Let's triple check. What I derived was:

supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x)

The inequalities I had in the middle, infy(y) <= supy(y), don't come from the given constraints. This inequality follows from the fact that for any region, the infimum of its projection on the y-axis is less than or equal to the supremum. So, the derived inequality chain does not necessarily lead to a contradiction.

Let me adjust the bounds once more for the NE case:

Example for x NE z:
- Let z's bounds be [0, 5] in the y-direction and [0, 1] in the x-direction.
- Let y's bounds be [4, 5] in the y-direction and [2, 3] in the x-direction.
- Let x's bounds be [6, 7] in the y-direction and [4, 5] in the x-direction.

Check all our constraints:

For x SE y:
- supx(y) (3) <= infx(x) (4) [✓]
- supy(x) (7) <= infy(y) (4) [✗]

Actually, the constraint supy(x) <= infy(y) is violated in this setup (7 <= 4 is false). I think I'm misunderstanding something.

Let's be very clear about the definitions again. For x SE y, we  y, we require:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

So, x SE y means that x is to the southeast of y.

For y E z, we require:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [y is to the east of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z) [y's vertical range is contained within z's]

This means y is directly to the east of z.

Now, let's see if x can be NE of z (x to the northeast of z) while satisfying the above constraints.

For x NE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(x) [x is to the north of z]

From the given constraints, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) [by transitivity]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [from y E z]

Now, for x to be NE of z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). But we don't have a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z) from the constraints. It's possible, for instance, that x has a very large vertical range, extending above z, despite its southernmost point being below y.

Ok actually, no, I think I was right before. Let me go back to the constraints and see if I can find a contradiction.

For x to be SE of y, we need supy(x) <= infy(y). For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). For y to be E of z, we need supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This means supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). However, this doesn't necessarily lead to a contradiction, since we don't know the relationship between infy(y) and supy(y). They are independent constraints.

I think I can find a coherent example for the NE case, if I think about it right.

Example for x NE z:
- Let z's bounds be [0, 5] in the y-direction and [0, 1] in the x-direction.
- Let y's bounds be [3, 4] in the y-direction and [2, 3] in the x-direction. (I'm being careful to make sure that supy(y) <= supy(z))
- Let x's bounds be [6, 7] in the y-direction and [4, 5] in the x-direction.

Check all our constraints:

For x SE y:
- supx(y) (3) <= infx(x) (4) [✓]
- supy(x) (7) <= infy(y) (3) [✗]

Actually, the constraint supy(x) <= infy(y) is still violated in this setup (7 <= 3 is false).

I think there is a reason I'm having trouble with this: we have constraints from x SE y that says that x lies to the southeast of y. that must mean that x cannot lie in the northeast (or really even in the north) direction of y. If y is to the east of z, then z is to the west of y. If x is SE of y, and y is to the east of z, then x should be to the southeast or east of z, and not to the northeast.

Let me revise my answer once more: the possible relations from our constraints are SE and E.

Actually wait, let's rethink the situation from scratch. the issue is that we have a constraints from x SE y that say x is to the southeast of y. but SE is being used in the cardinal directions sense with strict relationships. So SE here means that the supremum of x on the y-axis is below the infimum of y on the y-axis. This is a very restrictive constraint, that region x is completely below region y.

So, for x SE y, we require:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [the easternmost point of y is to the west of the westernmost point of x]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [the northernmost point of x is to the south of the southernmost point of y]

And for y E z, we require:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [the easternmost point of z is to the west of the westernmost point of y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z) [y's vertical range is contained within z's]

Let's consider the NE constraint:

For x NE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [the easternmost point of z is to the west of the westernmost point of x]
- supy(z) <= infy(x) [the northernmost point of z is to the south of the southernmost point of x]

From the given constraints, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) [by transitivity] ✓
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [from y E z]

For x to be NE of z, supy(z) <= infy(x) must hold. But from the derived constraints, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means x is below y (completely), and y's vertical range is contained within z's.

I think I can show by contradiction that x cannot be NE of z. If x is NE of z, then supy(z) <= infy(x). But from the constraints, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). By transitivity, supy(x) <= infy(y) implies that x is below y.

But from the constraints supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), we can derive supy(y) <= infy(x), implying that y is below x. This contradicts the fact that x is below y.

So, x cannot be NE of z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction
