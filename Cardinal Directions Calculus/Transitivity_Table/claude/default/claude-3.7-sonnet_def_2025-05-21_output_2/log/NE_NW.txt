PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to figure out the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that:
- x is NE of y
- y is NW of z

Let's analyze what these two given relations mean in terms of the bounding box coordinates:

x is NE of y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

y is NW of z means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let's see what we can infer:

From x is NE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
From y is NW of z, we have supx(y) <= infx(z).

From these, we can't directly establish a relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). So, x could be in any position relative to z along the x-axis.

Similarly, from x is NE of y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y is NW of z, we have supy(z) <= infy(y).

Combining these: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
This means x is definitely to the north of z (since supy(z) <= infy(x)).

Given that x is definitely to the north of z, the possible relations are:
- N (if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z))
- NE (if supx(z) <= infx(x))
- NW (if supx(x) <= infx(z))

But I need to check if these are all consistent with our initial constraints.

Let's consider a specific case:
If supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), then it's possible that infx(z) <= infx(x), which would make x either N or NE of z.

Alternatively, if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), it's also possible that supx(x) <= infx(z), which would make x NW of z.

Let me double-check this by considering specific examples:

Example 1:
- Let's say y's bounding box is [0,1] × [3,4].
- Since x is NE of y, it could be at [2,3] × [5,6].
- Since y is NW of z, z could be at [2,3] × [1,2].
- In this case, x is N of z.

Example 2:
- Let's say y's bounding box is [0,1] × [3,4].
- Since x is NE of y, it could be at [2,3] × [5,6].
- Since y is NW of z, z could be at [3,4] × [1,2].
- In this case, x is NW of z.

Example 3:
- Let's say y's bounding box is [0,1] × [3,4].
- Since x is NE of y, it could be at [2,3] × [5,6].
- Since y is NW of z, z could be at [0,1] × [1,2].
- In this case, x is NE of z.

So, based on these examples, the possible relations between x and z are N, NW, or NE.

Actually, let me think about this more systematically. I need to consider the constraints on the bounding box coordinates and see which cardinal directions are consistent with these constraints.

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is NE of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y is NW of z)

These don't directly relate infx(x) and infx(z), which means x could be to the west, east, or aligned with z on the x-axis.

Wait, I think I'm being a bit sloppy in my reasoning. Let me be more careful.

When we say "x is NE of y," we're talking about a specific cardinal direction relation between regions x and y. Same for "y is NW of z." I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z based on the given information.

For the NE relation, the formal definition is:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

For the NW relation, the formal definition is:
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

So, for the given constraints:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is NE of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y is NW of z)

I still can't derive a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) from these constraints. This means x could be to the east, west, or aligned with z on the x-axis.

Let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. N (North): This requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We know that x is to the north of z, but we can't determine the position along the x-axis. This could be a possible relation.

2. NE (North East): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x). We know that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), but this doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x). It's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), which would make x northeast of z.

3. NW (North West): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Again, we can't directly determine if this condition is met from the given constraints. But it's possible.

4. E (East): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Since we know x is to the north of z, the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) cannot be satisfied. So, x cannot be to the east of z.

5. W (West): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, since x is to the north of z, x cannot be to the west of z.

6. SE (South East), S (South), SW (South West): Since we know x is to the north of z, these relations are not possible.

7. B (Bounding Box): This requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Since we know x is to the north of z, the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) cannot be satisfied. So, x cannot be inside the bounding box of z.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (North East)
- NW (North West)

Actually, let me visualize this to confirm, using bounding boxes.

Imagine y's bounding box is in the center. Since x is NE of y, it's somewhere in the top-right quadrant from y. Since z is SE of y (which is the inverse of y NW z), it's somewhere in the bottom-right quadrant from y.

Wait, I made a mistake. If y is NW of z, then z is not SE of y. Instead, z is to the east and south of y. So, z would be in the bottom-right quadrant from y.

Now, with y in the center, x is in the top-right, and z is in the bottom-right. Depending on the exact positions, x could be:
- N of z (if x is directly above z)
- NE of z (if x is to the north and east of z)
- NW of z (if x is to the north and west of z)

But wait, if x is to the west of z, then x is also to the west of y (since y is to the west of z). This would contradict the fact that x is NE of y, which implies x is to the east of y.

So, actually, x cannot be to the west of z. This means the NW relation is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (North East)

Let me think about this again. If y is NW of z, then supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y). If x is NE of y, then supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which confirms that x is to the north of z.
- supx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between infx(z) and infx(x).

Hold on, I think I've been too restrictive in my reasoning. I need to consider that regions can be positioned in many ways as long as the constraints are satisfied.

Let me try to visualize this more concretely. I'll think of the bounding boxes of our regions, and use a 2D grid to represent their positions.

Imagine that our bounding boxes are single points on the 2D grid for simplicity:
- y is at (0, 0).
- Since x is NE of y, it could be at (1, 1).
- Since y is NW of z, z could be at (1, -1).

In this case, x is at (1, 1) and z is at (1, -1), which means x is N of z.

Now, let's shift z to the right:
- y is at (0, 0).
- x is at (1, 1).
- z is at (2, -1).

In this case, x is at (1, 1) and z is at (2, -1), which means x is NW of z.

Let's try another scenario, shifting z to the left:
- y is at (0, 0).
- x is at (1, 1).
- z is at (0.5, -1).

In this case, x is at (1, 1) and z is at (0.5, -1), which means x is NE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NW (North West)
- NE (North East)

But I noticed a mistake in my reasoning earlier. I said if y is NW of z, then x (which is NE of y) cannot be to the west of z. But that's not accurate. x can be to the west of z if y and z are positioned in a certain way.

Let's see:
- y is at (0, 0).
- x is at (1, 1).
- z is at (3, -1).

In this case, x is to the west of z (supx(x) = 1 < infx(z) = 3), but x is still NE of y and y is still NW of z.

Actually, wait. I realized that my mental model for the bounding boxes isn't quite right. The cardinal direction relations are based on the extents of the bounding boxes, not just their centers.

Let me redefine our regions using bounding boxes:
- y's bounding box is [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- x is NE of y, so its bounding box could be [2, 3] × [2, 3].
- y is NW of z, so z's bounding box could be [2, 3] × [-3, -2].

In this case, x is at [2, 3] × [2, 3] and z is at [2, 3] × [-3, -2], which means x is N of z.

But, by adjusting z's position, we can get other relations:
- y's bounding box is [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [2, 3].
- z's bounding box could be [4, 5] × [-3, -2].

In this case, x is at [2, 3] × [2, 3] and z is at [4, 5] × [-3, -2], which means x is NW of z.

Similarly, we can position z such that x is NE of z.

Ok, I think I was overthinking this. Let's just follow the definitions carefully.

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

For the relation between x and z, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which confirms that x is to the north of z.

For the x-axis, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is NE of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y is NW of z)

This doesn't give us a direct relation between infx(x) and infx(z).

Let's check each possible cardinal direction relation:

1. N (North): This requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We can't determine if this is satisfied from the given constraints, but it's possible.

2. NE (North East): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x). We can't determine if this is satisfied, but it's possible.

3. NW (North West): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z). We can't determine if this is satisfied, but it's possible.

Wait, actually let's be careful about the relation between infx(x) and infx(z).

From x is NE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
From y is NW of z, we have supx(y) <= infx(z).

So, both infx(x) and infx(z) are greater than or equal to supx(y). But we can't determine the relation between infx(x) and infx(z) from this.

Similarly, for the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x is NE of y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is NW of z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means x is to the north of z, but the exact relation on the x-axis can vary.

I think I now want to prove, more rigorously, that x cannot be to the south of z.

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

For x to be to the south of z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z). But from the given constraints, we can't derive this. In fact, we know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which suggests x is to the north of z.

So, x cannot be to the south of z, which means the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (North East)
- NW (North West)

But I'm still not sure if all three are possible. Let's construct specific examples to check.

Example 1 (x N z):
- y's bounding box is [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [2, 3].
- z's bounding box is [2, 3] × [-2, -1].

In this case, x is at [2, 3] × [2, 3] and z is at [2, 3] × [-2, -1], which means x is N of z. We can verify:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) = 1 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2.
- y is NW of z: supx(y) = 1 <= infx(z) = 2 and supy(z) = -1 <= infy(y) = 0.

Example 2 (x NE z):
- y's bounding box is [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [2, 3].
- z's bounding box is [0, 1] × [-2, -1].

In this case, x is at [2, 3] × [2, 3] and z is at [0, 1] × [-2, -1], which means x is NE of z. We can verify:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) = 1 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2.
- y is NW of z: supx(y) = 1 <= infx(z) = 0 (Wait, this is wrong. For y to be NW of z, we need supx(y) <= infx(z), but 1 is not <= 0. So we need to rethink our bounding boxes.)

- y's bounding box is [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [2, 3].
- z's bounding box is [2, 3] × [-2, -1].

Actually, for y to be NW of z, we need supx(y) <= infx(z). This is satisfied if z's x-coordinate is to the right of y's. So, if z is at [2, 3] × [-2, -1], then y is NW of z.

For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). But if z is at [2, 3] × [-2, -1], then supx(z) = 3 and infx(x) = 2, which doesn't satisfy the condition.

Let me rethink this.

Example 2 (x NE z):
- y's bounding box is [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- x's bounding box is [4, 5] × [2, 3].
- z's bounding box is [2, 3] × [-2, -1].

In this case, x is at [4, 5] × [2, 3] and z is at [2, 3] × [-2, -1]. Let's check if x is NE of z:
- supx(z) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4, so x is to the east of z.
- supy(z) = -1 <= infy(x) = 2, so x is to the north of z.
So, x is NE of z.

Now, let's check if x is NE of y and y is NW of z:
- supx(y) = 1 <= infx(x) = 4 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, so x is NE of y.
- supx(y) = 1 <= infx(z) = 2 and supy(z) = -1 <= infy(y) = 0, so y is NW of z.

Example 3 (x NW z):
- y's bounding box is [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [2, 3].
- z's bounding box is [4, 5] × [-2, -1].

In this case, x is at [2, 3] × [2, 3] and z is at [4, 5] × [-2, -1]. Let's check if x is NW of z:
- supx(x) = 3 <= infx(z) = 4, so x is to the west of z.
- supy(z) = -1 <= infy(x) = 2, so x is to the north of z.
So, x is NW of z.

Now, let's check if x is NE of y and y is NW of z:
- supx(y) = 1 <= infx(x) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, so x is NE of y.
- supx(y) = 1 <= infx(z) = 4 and supy(z) = -1 <= infy(y) = 0, so y is NW of z.

Great, it seems like all three relations, N, NE, and NW, are possible.

So, based on our analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (North East)
- NW (North West)

Actually, let's also consider the case where x and z are diagonal from each other but not strictly NE or NW. For example, if x's bounding box overlaps with z's bounding box along the x-axis, but x is still to the north of z.

Let's see if it's possible to have x N z, but not just directly north.

Example 4 (x N z):
- y's bounding box is [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- x's bounding box is [2, 4] × [2, 3].
- z's bounding box is [3, 5] × [-2, -1].

In this case, x is at [2, 4] × [2, 3] and z is at [3, 5] × [-2, -1]. Let's check the relation between x and z:
- infx(z) = 3 > infx(x) = 2, so x starts to the west of z.
- supx(z) = 5 > supx(x) = 4, so z extends further east than x.
But, infx(z) = 3 <= supx(x) = 4, so there's an overlap along the x-axis.
- supy(z) = -1 < infy(x) = 2, so x is to the north of z.

Wait, I'm not defining the N relation correctly. For x to be N of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means that x's bounding box's projection onto the x-axis should be contained within z's bounding box's projection onto the x-axis.

Let's redefine our examples:

Example 4 (x N z):
- y's bounding box is [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- x's bounding box is [3, 4] × [2, 3].
- z's bounding box is [2, 5] × [-2, -1].

In this case, x is at [3, 4] × [2, 3] and z is at [2, 5] × [-2, -1]. Let's check if x is N of z:
- infx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3, so x starts to the east of where z starts.
- supx(x) = 4 <= supx(z) = 5, so x ends to the west of where z ends.
- supy(z) = -1 <= infy(x) = 2, so x is to the north of z.
So, x is N of z.

Now, let's check if x is NE of y and y is NW of z:
- supx(y) = 1 <= infx(x) = 3 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, so x is NE of y.
- supx(y) = 1 <= infx(z) = 2 and supy(z) = -1 <= infy(y) = 0, so y is NW of z.

Great, it looks like the relation N is also possible.

So, based on our rigorous analysis with specific examples, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (North East)
- NW (North West)

But I realized that based on our formalism there is a definition for the "N" relation, the definition should be more nuanced. Let me double check it from the problem statement:

"a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)"

So, for x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge or aligned with it)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge or aligned with it)

Essentially, x's projection onto the x-axis should be contained within z's projection onto the x-axis, and x should be to the north of z.

Let's check if our Example 4 satisfies this:
- y's bounding box is [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- x's bounding box is [3, 4] × [2, 3].
- z's bounding box is [2, 5] × [-2, -1].

- supy(z) = -1 <= infy(x) = 2 (satisfied)
- infx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3 (satisfied)
- supx(x) = 4 <= supx(z) = 5 (satisfied)

So, x is N of z. And we've verified that this is consistent with x being NE of y and y being NW of z.

I want to summarize our findings (and double check my reasoning one more time):

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

For the relation between x and z, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which confirms that x is to the north of z.
- 
But for the x-axis, we can't directly determine the relation between x and z.

We've verified with specific examples that the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (North): Example 4 ([3, 4] × [2, 3] is N of [2, 5] × [-2, -1])
- NE (North East): Example 2 ([4, 5] × [2, 3] is NE of [2, 3] × [-2, -1])
- NW (North West): Example 3 ([2, 3] × [2, 3] is NW of [4, 5] × [-2, -1])

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (North East)
- NW (North West)

Actually, let's make sure that X cannot be B (bounding box) of Z.

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge or aligned with it)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge or aligned with it)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (z's bottom edge is below x's bottom edge or aligned with it)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top edge is below z's top edge or aligned with it)

We already determined that x is to the north of z, which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the condition for "B" that supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

Now let's check S, SE, and SW.

Actually wait. I don't need to check these explicitly. We already know that x is to the north of z, which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the condition for "S", "SE", and "SW" that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be to the south of z in any way.

Similarly, the conditions for "E" and "W" require that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Since we know that supy(z) <= infy(x), x cannot be to the pure east or pure west of z either.

Actually, let me confirm that x has to be to the north of z once more. From the given:
- x is NE of y: supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- y is NW of z: supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Combining these, we get: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which implies that x is to the north of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are indeed:
- N (North)
- NE (North East)
- NW (North West)

And to double check one more time, these are the correct definitions from our formalism:

"a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)"

"a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)"

"a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)"

These are the relations we've verified.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z are:
N, NE, NW.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

N, NE, NW

Since x is NE of y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

Since y is NW of z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x must be to the north of z
- The east-west relationship between x and z remains unconstrained

Therefore, x must be in one of the northern positions relative to z: N, NE, or NW.
