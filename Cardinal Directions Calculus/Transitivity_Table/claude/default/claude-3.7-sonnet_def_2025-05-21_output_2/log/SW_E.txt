PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step using the definitions of cardinal directions.

We're given that:
1. x is SW of y, which means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

2. y is E of z, which means:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's first understand what we know about x and z based on the transitive relations:

From x being SW of y:
- x is to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))
- x is below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y))

From y being E of z:
- y is to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
- z can extend above and below y within certain bounds (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z))

Now, combining these constraints:
- x is to the left of y, and y is to the right of z, so relative to the x-axis, we have:
  - We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
  - This means both x and z are to the left of y, but we don't know their relative position to each other on the x-axis.

- Regarding the y-axis:
  - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
  - We know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z can extend both below and above y)

So, the y-coordinate of x is below the lower bound of y, but z can extend below y's lower bound. This means x and z could overlap in the y-coordinate if z extends far enough below y.

Let's examine all possible cardinal directions that x could have with respect to z:

1. S (South): This would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - The first two conditions are possible if z extends further left than x and further right than x.
   - The third condition means x must be below z. Since x is below y, and z can extend below y, this is uncertain.

2. SW (Southwest): This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - The first condition would mean x is to the left of z, which contradicts the possibility that z could be to the left of x.
   - The second condition, as discussed, is uncertain.

3. W (West): This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - The first condition contradicts the possibility that z could be to the left of x.
   - The second and third conditions are uncertain.

4. NW (Northwest): This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - The first condition contradicts the possibility that z could be to the left of x.
   - The second condition would require x to be above z, which seems unlikely given that x is below y and z can extend above y.

5. N (North): This would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - The first condition seems unlikely given that x is below y and z can extend above y.
   - The second and third conditions are uncertain.

6. NE (Northeast): This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - The first condition would require z to be to the left of x, which is possible.
   - The second condition, as discussed, seems unlikely.

7. E (East): This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - The first condition is possible if z is to the left of x.
   - The second and third conditions are uncertain.

8. SE (Southeast): This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - The first condition is possible if z is to the left of x.
   - The second condition is uncertain.

9. B (Bounding Box): This would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - These conditions require z to completely contain x, which is uncertain given the constraints.

Hmm, I'm not getting clear constraints to determine which cardinal directions are definitively possible. Let's approach this differently.

Let's think about the spatial arrangement more directly. We have:
- x is to the southwest of y (left and below y)
- y is to the east of z (right of z)

So spatially, we have z on the left, y on the right, and x to the southwest of y.

Let's consider where x could be in relation to z:
- x must be to the left of y (given x is SW of y)
- z must also be to the left of y (given y is E of z)
- x must be below y (given x is SW of y)
- z can be at any height relative to y (given y is E of z)

So, x could be:
- to the left or right of z (depending on how far left z extends)
- below, at the same level, or above z (depending on how z's height relates to x's)

This means that x could have several possible cardinal directions with respect to z: SW, S, SE, W, B, E, NW, N, or NE.

Wait, let me draw this out spatially to get a better understanding. We know:
- x is to the left and below y (x is SW of y)
- z is to the left of y (y is E of z)

Actually, let me approach this differently.

Given:
- x is SW of y, which means x is to the left and below y.
- y is E of z, which means y is to the right of z.

Now, x being SW of y means x is in the southwest quadrant from y as the reference point. And y being E of z means y is in the east tile from z as the reference point.

Let's place z as the origin and see where x and y can be relative to z. Since y is E of z, y must be in the East tile from z, which means y is to the right of z, possibly extending above and below z.

Given that x is SW of y, x must be to the left and below y. 

Now, let's think about where x can be in relation to z. If y is to the east of z and x is to the southwest of y, x could be in various positions:

1. x could be south of z if x is below z and within the x-boundaries of z.
2. x could be southwest of z if x is both to the left and below z.
3. x could be west of z if x is to the left of z and within the y-boundaries of z.
4. x could be in the bounding box of z (i.e., within z) if z contains x.
5. x could be southeast of z if x is to the right and below z.

I think these are the only possible cardinal directions based on the constraints. Let me double-check each one:

S (South): Yes, if x is below z and horizontally within z's boundaries.
SW (Southwest): Yes, if x is both to the left and below z.
W (West): Yes, if x is to the left of z and vertically within z's boundaries.
B (Bounding Box): Yes, if z contains x.
SE (Southeast): Yes, if x is to the right and below z.

I don't believe x can be to the north of z because x is below y, and y can't be too far below z (since y is E of z, which constrains the vertical relationship). 

Actually, I realize I need to be more careful and precise with the constraints. The constraints for y being E of z include:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's lower y-bound is at or below y's lower y-bound)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's upper y-bound is at or below z's upper y-bound)

The constraints for x being SW of y include:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

Combining these, we know:
- x is to the left of y
- y is to the right of z
- x is below y
- z can extend above and below y

Let's place this on a grid. I'll use (x1, y1) to represent the lower-left corner of a region, and (x2, y2) to represent the upper-right corner.

Constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y), which means x2 ≤ y1 on the x-axis.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y), which means x2 ≤ y1 on the y-axis.
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y), which means z2 ≤ y1 on the x-axis.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y), which means z1 ≤ y1 on the y-axis.
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means y2 ≤ z2 on the y-axis.

Now, I'll determine the possible cardinal directions of x with respect to z.

1. N (North): This would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x), along with x being horizontally aligned with z.
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
   - This implies supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
   - So, it's not possible for supy(z) ≤ infy(x) because that would contradict the chain of inequalities.
   - Therefore, x cannot be N of z.

2. NE (Northeast): This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - As shown above, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not possible.
   - Therefore, x cannot be NE of z.

3. E (East): This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know z2 ≤ y1 on the x-axis (from supx(z) ≤ infx(y)) and x2 ≤ y1 on the x-axis (from supx(x) ≤ infx(y)).
   - This doesn't give us a direct constraint between x and z on the x-axis. x could be to the right of z, so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is possible.
   - We know z1 ≤ y1 on the y-axis (from infy(z) ≤ infy(y)) and x2 ≤ y1 on the y-axis (from supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).
   - Again, this doesn't give us a direct constraint between x and z on the y-axis, so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible.
   - We know y2 ≤ z2 on the y-axis (from supy(y) ≤ supy(z)), but we don't have a direct constraint on the upper y-bound of x relative to z.
   - Given that x is SW of y and y is E of z, it's plausible that supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - Therefore, x can be E of z.

4. SE (Southeast): This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - As explained for E, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is possible.
   - We know x2 ≤ y1 on the y-axis (from supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) and z1 ≤ y1 on the y-axis (from infy(z) ≤ infy(y)).
   - This doesn't give us a direct constraint on the y-bound of x relative to the y-bound of z. x could be below the lower bound of z, so supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is possible.
   - Therefore, x can be SE of z.

5. S (South): This would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - As explained for SE, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is possible.
   - Without direct constraints on the x-bounds of x and z, it's plausible that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) could both be true.
   - Therefore, x can be S of z.

6. SW (Southwest): This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know x2 ≤ y1 on the x-axis (from supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and z2 ≤ y1 on the x-axis (from supx(z) ≤ infx(y)).
   - This doesn't give us a direct constraint between x and z on the x-axis. x could be to the left of z, so supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible.
   - As explained for SE, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is possible.
   - Therefore, x can be SW of z.

7. W (West): This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - As explained for SW, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible.
   - We know z1 ≤ y1 on the y-axis (from infy(z) ≤ infy(y)) and x2 ≤ y1 on the y-axis (from supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).
   - This doesn't give us a direct constraint between the lower y-bound of x and the lower y-bound of z. It's plausible that infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - As explained for E, supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is plausible.
   - Therefore, x can be W of z.

8. NW (Northwest): This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - As explained for W, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible.
   - By the same reasoning as for N, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not possible.
   - Therefore, x cannot be NW of z.

9. B (Bounding Box): This would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We lack direct constraints between most of these variables, but all of these conditions are plausible based on the constraints we have.
   - Therefore, x can be in the B of z.

Based on the analysis, the possible cardinal directions of x with respect to z are: E, SE, S, SW, W, and B.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to basics.

If x is SW of y and y is E of z, then:
- x is below and to the left of y.
- y is to the right of z.

Spatially, this arrangement looks like:
```
    z<---y
        /
       /
      x
```

Where:
- z is to the left of y.
- x is to the southwest of y (below and to the left of y).

Given this arrangement, where could x be relative to z?
- x could be to the east of z (if x is directly below y).
- x could be to the southeast of z (if x is below and slightly to the right of z).
- x could be to the south of z (if x is directly below z).
- x could be to the southwest of z (if x is below and to the left of z).
- x could be to the west of z (if x is to the left of z and at a similar height).
- x could be within z's bounding box (if z encompasses x).

So, the possible cardinal directions are: E, SE, S, SW, W, B.

But wait, I haven't considered the full definition of the cardinal directions. Let me recheck.

In the definition:
- E (East): supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- SE (Southeast): supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- S (South): supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- SW (Southwest): supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- W (West): supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- NW (Northwest): supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- N (North): supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- NE (Northeast): supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- B (Bounding Box): infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

From the given constraints:
- x is SW of y, which means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- y is E of z, which means supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Now, let's see if any of the cardinal directions can be ruled out:

N (North): This would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x being SW of y).
- We also know supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y being E of z).
- Combining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
- For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- But from the chain of inequalities, supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (since infy(x) < supy(x)).
- Therefore, x cannot be N of z.

Using similar reasoning, x cannot be NE or NW of z.

SE (Southeast): This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- We know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y being E of z).
- We also know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x being SW of y).
- These don't give us a direct constraint between supx(z) and infx(x). x could be to the right of z, satisfying supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x being SW of y).
- We also know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y being E of z).
- Again, there's no direct constraint between supy(x) and infy(z). x could be below z, satisfying supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- Therefore, x can be SE of z.

Using this approach, let's check all directions:

N (North): 
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x being SW of y).
We also know supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y being E of z).
These combine to give supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
But for x to be N of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
Therefore, x cannot be N of z.

NE (Northeast): 
For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
From the previous analysis for N, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is contradicted.
Therefore, x cannot be NE of z.

E (East): 
For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
We know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y being E of z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x being SW of y). 
It's possible that supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so this doesn't rule out E.
We know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y being E of z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x being SW of y).
From these, we can't derive a direct constraint between infy(z) and infy(x).
We also can't derive a direct constraint between supy(x) and supy(z).
So, based on the given constraints, x can be E of z.

SE (Southeast): 
As analyzed above, x can be SE of z.

S (South): 
For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x being SW of y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y being E of z).
These don't give us a direct constraint between supy(x) and infy(z), so this doesn't rule out S.
We also don't have direct constraints to compare infx(z) and infx(x), or supx(x) and supx(z).
So, based on the given constraints, x can be S of z.

SW (Southwest): 
For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x being SW of y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y being E of z).
These don't give us a direct constraint between supx(x) and infx(z), so this doesn't rule out SW.
As with S, we don't have a direct constraint between supy(x) and infy(z).
So, based on the given constraints, x can be SW of z.

W (West): 
For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
We have no direct constraints to compare supx(x) and infx(z), infy(z) and infy(x), or supy(x) and supy(z).
So, based on the given constraints, x can be W of z.

NW (Northwest): 
For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
We have no direct constraint to compare supx(x) and infx(z).
For supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x being SW of y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y being E of z).
Combining these, we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
This contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x to be NW of z.
Therefore, x cannot be NW of z.

B (Bounding Box): 
For x to be in the B of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
We have no direct constraints to compare these variables.
So, based on the given constraints, x can be in the B of z.

I realized that I was imputing too many constraints on the problem directly from the spatial reasoning. Let's be careful and just trace this through once more:

Given:
- x is SW of y, which means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- y is E of z, which means supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Let's check each cardinal direction:

N (North): 
For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x being SW of y).
We also know supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y being E of z).
These constraints only tell us about supy(x) and supy(z), not infy(x).
Without a direct constraint on infy(x), we can't rule out N just yet.

Actually, wait. I need to be more careful. The constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(y) means the uppermost point of region x is below the lowermost point of region y. So x is strictly below y.

Similarly, supy(y) ≤ supy(z) means the uppermost point of region y is at most as high as the uppermost point of region z.

Combining these, the uppermost point of x is below the lowermost point of y, which is at most as high as the uppermost point of z. This still doesn't give us a direct constraint on infy(x) in relation to supy(z).

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let's be simpler.

For x to be N of z, we need x to be strictly above z. In other words, the lowermost point of x should be above the uppermost point of z. That is, supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

But we know:
1. x is strictly below y, which means supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
2. z can extend above y, which means supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Transitively, we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we've established supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Since infy(x) ≤ supy(x) (by the definition of sup and inf), we have infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

So, x cannot be N of z.

Similar reasoning applies for NE and NW, as they both require x to be strictly above z. So, x cannot be NE or NW of z.

I've determined that:
- x cannot be N, NE, or NW of z.
- For the other cardinal directions (E, SE, S, SW, W, B), our constraints don't outright rule them out. So, these are all possible directions, based on the given constraints.

Therefore, the possible cardinal directions of x with respect to z are: E, SE, S, SW, W, and B.

Actually, am I really sure about B? Let's check one more time.

For x to be B (inside the bounding box) of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Since x is SW of y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y). And since y is E of z, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y). So, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), which means both supx(x) and supx(z) are at most infx(y). 

The constraint we need for B is supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which is definitely possible given our known constraints.

Actually, I need to be careful about another constraint. Does x being SW of y and y being E of z necessarily mean that x and z overlap in the x-axis? Let's see.

Since x is SW of y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y). And since y is E of z, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y). So, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

For B, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But we only know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), which doesn't directly constrain supx(x) relative to supx(z) or infx(z) relative to infx(x).

Basically, x and z could be positioned such that they're both to the left of y, but there's no specific constraint forcing one to be within the bounding box of the other.

Similarly, for the y-coordinates, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x being SW of y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y being E of z), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y being E of z). 

For B, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We already know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y). We just need to know if supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which is obviously valid. But, for the other constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(x), we just know infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we don't have a direct relation between infy(z) and infy(x).

So while x being in the B of z is a possibility, it's not a necessary outcome.

In other words, based on the given constraints, x could be in the B of z.

I'm going to summarize what I've determined. I haven't been able to outright rule out:
- x being E of z
- x being SE of z
- x being S of z
- x being SW of z
- x being W of z
- x being in the B of z

I've concluded that x cannot be N, NE, or NW of z because all three directions require x to be strictly above z, which contradicts the constraints (derived from x being strictly below y and z potentially extending above y).

Therefore, the possible cardinal directions of x with respect to z are: E, SE, S, SW, W, and B.

Actually, let's double-check B in particular. For x to be B of z (i.e., within z's bounding box), all parts of x must be within the extents of z. This means the lowermost point of x is above the lowermost point of z, the uppermost point of x is below the uppermost point of z, the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z, and the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z.

Now, from our constraints:
- x is SW of y, which means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). (x is both to the left and below y)
- y is E of z, which means supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). (y is to the right of z, and z can extend above and below y within certain bounds)

For x to be B of z, we need:
1. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z)
2. supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z)
3. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (lowermost point of x is above the lowermost point of z)
4. supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (uppermost point of x is below the uppermost point of z)

Let's check if our constraints guarantee these:

- For supx(x) ≤ supx(z): We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means both the rightmost point of x and the rightmost point of z are to the left of the leftmost point of y. But this doesn't give us a direct relation between supx(x) and supx(z). So, we can't guarantee supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

Hmm, I need to be careful about the constraints. For Z being E of Z we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means:
1. The rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of y.
2. The lowermost point of z is at most as high as the lowermost point of y.
3. The uppermost point of y is at most as high as the uppermost point of z.

So let's try this again. For x to be B of z, we need:
1. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z)
2. supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z)
3. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (lowermost point of x is above the lowermost point of z)
4. supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (uppermost point of x is below the uppermost point of z)

Based on our constraints, I'm not sure I can derive these. The given constraints don't provide definitive information about the relative positions of x and z in all these dimensions.

So I don't think I can rule out B as a possible cardinal direction based on the given constraints.

So I still think the possible cardinal directions of x with respect to z are: E, SE, S, SW, W, and B.

Hmm, but there's something odd about E. For x to be E of z, x must be entirely to the right of z.

We know x is SW of y, which means x is to the left of (or at the same x-coordinate as) the left boundary of y. And we know y is E of z, which means the right boundary of z is to the left of (or at the same x-coordinate as) the left boundary of y.

So, both x and z are to the left of y. But without more specific constraints, x could be either to the left or to the right of z.

Let's make a spatial picture. It looks like this.

```
      z<---y
         \
          \
           x
```

In this diagram, z is to the west of y. x is to the southwest of y. This means x can be in a multitude of positions as long as its to the south and west of y. For example, x could be more west-leaning:

```
      z
       \
        \
         y
        /
       /
      x
```

Or it could be more south-leaning:

```
      z<---y
           |
           |
           x
```

Given the constraints, both of these arrangements (and many others) are possible. In the first arrangement, x is to the W or SW of z. In the second arrangement, x is to the S or SE of z. Given the variety of possible positions, x could be E, SE, S, SW, W, or B relative to z.

I'm still not entirely confident about E, though. Let me think of a concrete example. If y is directly E of z, and x is directly S of y, would x be E of z?

In this case, y would be at the same latitude as z, but to the right. And x would be directly below y. So x is SE of z, not E.

Hmm, I tried to come up with an arrangement where x is E of z, given that x is SW of y and y is E of z, but I'm not sure it's possible. I've tried several ways, and it seems like x can't be directly E of z.

For x to be directly E of z, x must be at the same latitude as z but to the right. Since x is SW of y, it's to the left and below y. And since y is E of z, y is to the right of z. So, x can't just be to the right of z, which is what's needed for x to be E of z.

I'm thinking E is not a possibility.

Let me think of it in terms of coordinates. Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Since y is E of z, y is at (a, b) where a > 0 and b can be any value. Since x is SW of y, x is at (c, d) where c < a and d < b.

For x to be E of z, we need c > 0 (x is to the right of z). Since c < a and a > 0, c could be positive, making x potentially to the east of z. But for x to be directly E of z, x and z must share the same latitude, which means d needs to be within the y-range of z. But the constraints don't prevent this.

So while it's not a guaranteed outcome, I think x can be E of z based on the constraints.

I'm going to think of it one more time. For x to be directly E of z:
- Every point in x must be to the right of every point in z. Let's call this constraint C1.
- x and z must overlap vertically (i.e., they share at least one common y-coordinate). Let's call this constraint C2.

Now, from the problem:
- x is SW of y, which means x is both to the left and below y. Let's call these constraints C3 and C4.
- y is E of z, which means y is to the right of z. Let's call this constraint C5.

Constraint C3 implies that every point in x is to the left of every point in y. Similarly, constraint C5 implies that every point in y is to the right of every point in z.

Combining C3 and C5, we can say that every point in x is to the left of every point in y, and every point in y is to the right of every point in z. This doesn't directly contradict constraint C1 (that every point in x is to the right of every point in z). But it doesn't guarantee it either. It depends on the specific positions of x, y, and z.

Constraint C4 states that x is below y. If x is directly E of z, then x and z share at least one common y-coordinate. If x is below y and x and z share a y-coordinate, then z must extend vertically below y. This is feasible with the constraint that y is E of z, as z can extend vertically beyond y.

So I think x can be E of z based on the constraints, as I had concluded earlier. There doesn't seem to be a contradiction.

Actually, let's check more precisely. For x to be E of z, we need three conditions to be met:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(x): The rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x.
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(x): The lowermost point of z is at most as high as the lowermost point of x.
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(z): The uppermost point of x is at most as high as the uppermost point of z.

We know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y): The rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y): The uppermost point of x is below the lowermost point of y.
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y): The rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of y.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y): The lowermost point of z is at most as high as the lowermost point of y.
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z): The uppermost point of y is at most as high as the uppermost point of z.

From the first and third constraints, we know both supx(x) and supx(z) are to the left of infx(y). But this doesn't tell us anything about the relation between supx(z) and infx(x). So, condition 1 is not guaranteed.

Therefore, x being E of z is not a guaranteed outcome based on the given constraints. But it's also not explicitly contradicted. It depends on the specific positions of x, y, and z. So x can potentially be E of z.

Ok so to recap, I believe the possible cardinal directions of x with respect to z are: E, SE, S, SW, W, and B.

Wait, I actually want to add one more thing: I just realized I've been thinking of cardinal directions in the original sense of the 8 points of a compass (plus B for bounding box). But the problem is asking for the possible relations, which means the 9 definitions as enumerated: {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Hmm, actually I just realized that the cardinal direction relations in the problem are specifically defined as a set of possible tiling relations. In the problem, a cardinal direction relation is defined as "an expression R1: ... : Rk", where Ri are single-tile cardinal directions. Given what's defined in the problem, the cardinal directions are actually referring to a set of tiles that are occupied by the region.

So when I'm determining the cardinal directions of x with respect to z, I'm actually checking which of these tile relations hold.

So to be absolutely clear: the possible cardinal direction relations of x with respect to z are: E, SE, S, SW, W, and B.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between region x and region z, given the constraints:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is E of region z

From these constraints, I know:
- x is SW of y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is E of z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let me analyze which cardinal directions are possible for x relative to z:

For N, NE, NW directions:
These all require x to be above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). However, we know x is below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), and z can extend above y (supy(y) ≤ supy(z)). This creates the chain: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), making it impossible for x to be above z.

For E, SE, S, SW, W, and B directions:
None of these are ruled out by our constraints. Since both x and z are positioned to the left of y (but with no direct constraint between them horizontally), and x is below y while z can extend both above and below y, all these directions remain possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: E, SE, S, SW, W, B
