PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We know:
- x is E of y, which means y is the reference region and x lies to the East of y. Formally, supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is S of z, which means z is the reference region and y lies to the South of z. Formally, supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Now, let's figure out what the possible relations between x and z could be.

For x to be E of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

For the first condition, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x) (because x is E of y). We also know that supx(y) <= supx(z) (because y is S of z). This means supx(y) <= supx(z). However, we can't directly infer that supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the second condition, we know that infy(y) <= infy(x) (because x is E of y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (because y is S of z). From this, we can't directly infer anything about the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).

For the third condition, we know that supy(x) <= supy(y) (because x is E of y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (because y is S of z). This means supy(x) <= infy(z), which is consistent with the condition for SE but not for E.

Let's continue by checking other possible relations:

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We just showed that supy(x) <= infy(z). But for the first condition, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). We know supx(y) <= infx(x) (because x is E of y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (because y is S of z). This doesn't directly give us supx(z) <= infx(x).

For x to be S of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z). For the second condition, we know infx(z) <= infx(y) (because y is S of z), but we don't have direct information about the relationship between infx(y) and infx(x) based on the fact that x is E of y.

Hmm, I think I'm having a bit of trouble directly inferring the possible relations between x and z based solely on the given constraints.

Instead, let me approach this differently. Let's visualize the constraints and see what they imply about the possible positions of x relative to z.

First, we know x is E of y, which means x is to the right of y. Second, we know y is S of z, which means y is below z.

So, if x is to the right of y and y is below z, where could x be relative to z?

x could be:
- To the right of z (E)
- Below and to the right of z (SE)
- Below z (S)
- To the right and above z (NE)
- Above z (N)

Actually, let's think about this more carefully.

From x is E of y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not above the top of y)

From y is S of z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of y is not to the left of the left boundary of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is not to the right of the right boundary of z)

Now let's combine these to infer possible relations between x and z:

For x to be E of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means:
- We can't definitely say supx(z) <= infx(x).
- We don't have a direct relation between infy(z) and infy(x).
- Because supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we have supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the third condition for E. So, x can't be E of z.

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our constraints, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). But we can't definitely say supx(z) <= infx(x).

For x to be S of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We have supy(x) <= infy(z). We know infx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't know the relation between infx(y) and infx(x). We also know supx(y) <= infx(x), but that doesn't directly give us a relation between supx(x) and supx(z).

I think I'm going to take a different approach. Let's identify specific positioning to determine the possible relations.

Scenario 1: x is completely East of y without any overlap in x-coordinates, and y is completely South of z without any overlap in y-coordinates.
- Because x is E of y and y has no overlap with z in terms of y-coordinates, x can be SE, E, or NE of z, depending on its y-coordinates.

Scenario 2: x has some overlap with y in terms of y-coordinates, and y has some overlap with z in terms of x-coordinates.
- Here, the relation between x and z could be more varied.

Actually, I think I'm making this more complicated than needed. I should just identify all the possible arrangements of x relative to z given the constraints, and then determine the corresponding cardinal directions.

I know:
- x is to the right of y (x is E of y)
- y is below z (y is S of z)

So, x must be to the right of y, and y must be below z.

Given this, where can x be in relation to z?

1. x can be directly to the right of z (E of z).
2. x can be below and to the right of z (SE of z).
3. x can be directly below z (S of z).
4. x can be directly above z (N of z).
5. x can be above and to the right of z (NE of z).
6. I guess x could also overlap with z in bounding box (B relation).

Let's verify each of these possibilities using the constraints:

For x to be E of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Since we know x is E of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). And since y is S of z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z). But this doesn't necessarily mean supx(z) <= infx(x). So we can't definitively say if x is E of z.

But wait, we also know from x being E of y that infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). And from y being S of z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z). This means supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the third condition for x being E of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

Now, for x to be SE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). But we still can't definitively say supx(z) <= infx(x). However, it's possible for x to be positioned such that supx(z) <= infx(x), making SE a possible relation.

For x to be S of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). We know infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is S of z). If x is positioned such that infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then S becomes a possible relation.

For x to be NE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We can't derive these conditions directly from the given constraints, but it's possible for x to be positioned such that both these conditions are met, making NE a possible relation.

For x to be N of z, we would need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

Similarly, these conditions can be met depending on the specific positioning of x, making N a possible relation.

For the B relation, it would mean x is inside the bounding box of z. But from our constraints, we know x is to the right of y and y is below z. This doesn't restrict x from being inside the bounding box of z, so B is a possible relation.

I think I lost track of something. Let me reconsider this more systematically. 

For relation E, we need
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z) 
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z) 
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z) 

Given x is E of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), and given y is S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This means infx(z) <= infx(y) < = supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x).

But from these, we can't deduce that supx(z) <= infx(x). So we can't be sure that x is to the right of z.

Similarly, we can't deduce the other conditions solely based on our constraints. E is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

Actually, I need to more carefully consider the constraints again. Let's do it step by step.

We have:
- x is E of y, which means supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is S of z, which means supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

From the first and third constraints of "x is E of y", we know that x is within the y-extent of y (i.e., the y-coordinate range of x is within the y-coordinate range of y). And from the first constraint of "y is S of z", we know that the top of y is below the bottom of z. This means that the top of x is below the bottom of z, i.e., supy(x) <= infy(z). So, the y-coordinate of x and z do not overlap.

Similarly, from the first constraint of "x is E of y", we know that x is to the right of y, and from the second and third constraints of "y is S of z", we know that the x-extent of y is within the x-extent of z. However, this doesn't give us a direct relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z. It's possible for x to overlap with the x-extent of z.

Given these constraints, x can be:
1. SE of z (if supx(z) <= infx(x)) - This is possible if z is positioned such that its right boundary is to the left of x's left boundary.
2. S of z (if infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)) - This is possible if x's x-extent is within the x-extent of z.
3. SW of z (if infx(x) <= infx(z)) - This is possible if x's left boundary is to the left of z's left boundary.

Actually, I need to double-check if SW is truly possible. Let's verify.

For x to be SW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). But from our constraints, we know x is E of y, which means supx(y) <= infx(x). And from y is S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y). This gives us infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). From these, we can't deduce supx(x) <= infx(z). In fact, this relation is consistent with infx(x) >= infx(z), which contradicts the first condition for x to be SW of z.

It seems SW is not a possible relation. Let me re-analyze the possible relations to be sure.

OK I think I'm being careless in how I'm analyzing these. Let me directly attempt to trace out all possibilities given our constraints. 

We have:
- x is E of y, which means x is to the right of y without any overlap in x-coordinates.
- y is S of z, which means y is below z without any overlap in y-coordinates.

Given these constraints, and considering the possible positions of x relative to z, I'll list the possible cardinal directions from x to z:

1. SE: x is to the right of z and below z. This is possible if x is to the right of the projection of z onto the x-axis and below the projection of z onto the y-axis.
2. S: x is directly below z. This is possible if x overlaps with the projection of z onto the x-axis and is below the projection of z onto the y-axis.
3. E: x is directly to the right of z. This is possible if x is to the right of the projection of z onto the x-axis and overlaps with the projection of z onto the y-axis.
4. NE: x is to the right of z and above z. This is possible if x is to the right of the projection of z onto the x-axis and above the projection of z onto the y-axis.
5. N: x is directly above z. This is possible if x overlaps with the projection of z onto the x-axis and is above the projection of z onto the y-axis.
6. B: x is inside the bounding box of z. This is possible if x's projections onto both the x-axis and y-axis are within z's projections.
7. NW: x is to the left of z and above z. This would require x to be to the left of the projection of z onto the x-axis, which is not possible given our constraints.
8. W: x is directly to the left of z. This would require x to be to the left of the projection of z onto the x-axis, which is not possible given our constraints.
9. SW: x is to the left of z and below z. This would require x to be to the left of the projection of z onto the x-axis, which is not possible given our constraints.

Let me double-check these with the constraints we derived.

Actually, I spoke too soon. Let me trace the possibilities more carefully now.

We have:
- x is E of y, which means supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is S of z, which means supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

From the first constraint of "x is E of y" and the third constraint of "y is S of z", we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't immediately tell us the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). 

From the second and third constraints of "x is E of y" and the first constraint of "y is S of z", we have infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y), and supy(y) <= infy(z). This gives us supy(x) <= infy(z), meaning x is below z in terms of y-coordinates.

Given these constraints, let's check the possible cardinal directions:

1. SE: For x to be SE of z, we would need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). From supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we can't determine if supx(z) <= infx(x). But it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x). SE is a possible relation.

2. S: For x to be S of z, we would need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). From infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is S of z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is E of y), we can't determine if infx(z) <= infx(x). But it's possible for infx(z) <= infx(x). Similarly, we can't determine if supx(x) <= supx(z). S is a possible relation.

3. E: For x to be E of z, we would need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). This means supy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts the third condition for x to be E of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

4. NE: For x to be NE of z, we would need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the second condition for x to be NE of z (since infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z)). So, x cannot be NE of z.

5. N: For x to be N of z, we would need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the first condition for x to be N of z (since infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z)). So, x cannot be N of z.

6. B: For x to be B of z, we would need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). This means supy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts the fourth condition for x to be B of z. So, x cannot be B of z.

7. NW: For x to be NW of z, we would need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the second condition for x to be NW of z. Moreover, from supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is E of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is S of z), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This contradicts the first condition for x to be NW of z (since supx(x) > infx(x) > infx(z)). So, x cannot be NW of z.

8. W: For x to be W of z, we would need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the third condition for x to be W of z. Moreover, from supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is E of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is S of z), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This contradicts the first condition for x to be W of z. So, x cannot be W of z.

9. SW: For x to be SW of z, we would need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). But from supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is E of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is S of z), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x to be SW of z (since infx(x) < supx(x)). So, x cannot be SW of z.

Let's double-check these deductions again.

OK, I'm being a bit sloppy at times. Let me break down the constraints and the checks more systematically.

From "x is E of y", we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of y)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not above the top of y)

From "y is S of z", we have:
4. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left of y is not to the left of the left of z)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right of y is not to the right of the right of z)

From 1 and 5, we can deduce:
7. supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which gives infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).

From 3 and 4, we can deduce:
8. supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which gives supy(x) <= infy(z).

Now, let's check each relationship between x and z:

For SE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). From 1 and 6, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly give us supx(z) <= infx(x). So SE is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For S, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). From 7, we have infx(z) <= infx(x). We don't have a direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). So S is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For E, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). This means supy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts the third condition for E. So E is not a possible relation.

For NE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). This means infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z), which contradicts the second condition for NE. So NE is not a possible relation.

For N, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). This means infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z), which contradicts the first condition for N. So N is not a possible relation.

For B, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). This means supy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts the fourth condition for B. So B is not a possible relation.

For NW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). This means infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z), which contradicts the second condition for NW. Additionally, from 7, we have infx(z) <= infx(x). This means supx(x) > infx(x) >= infx(z), which contradicts the first condition for NW. So NW is not a possible relation.

For W, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). This means supy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts the third condition for W. Additionally, from 7, we have infx(z) <= infx(x). This means supx(x) > infx(x) >= infx(z), which contradicts the first condition for W. So W is not a possible relation.

For SW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). But from 7, we have infx(z) <= infx(x). This means supx(x) > infx(x) >= infx(z), which contradicts the first condition for SW. So SW is not a possible relation.

Let me double check my constraints for S again. I'm becoming a bit concerned that I may have missed something.

For S, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z).

From 7, we have infx(z) <= infx(x).

For the third condition, we need to check if supx(x) <= supx(z). From our original constraints, we don't have a direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). So S remains a possible relation.

Wait, there's something I realized. In my analysis for SE, I said it wasn't guaranteed. But let's think about it again.

For SE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the first condition, from 7, I deduced infx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) if we assume infx(z) is supposed to be less than or equal to supx(z). So SE cannot be a relation.

Actually, I'm mixing up my inequalities. Let me re-evaluate SE again.

For SE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From 8, we have supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the first condition, from 7, I deduced infx(z) <= infx(x). But that's not what the first condition requires. We need to check if supx(z) <= infx(x). From our original constraints, we don't have a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). So SE remains a possible relation.

Let me redo this once more.

For a region a, infx(a) is the minimum x-coordinate and supx(a) is the maximum x-coordinate. Similarly for y-coordinates. The single-tile cardinal direction relation "a SE b" means "a is to the southeast of b". For "a SE b" to hold, we need:
1. supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the right of b)
2. supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is below b)

Given the constraints:
- "x is E of y" means supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- "y is S of z" means supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Now, let's analyze which direction x can be relative to z.

For "x SE z" to hold, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

Checking the second condition, from "x is E of y", we have supy(x) <= supy(y), and from "y is S of z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z). Combining these, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition for "x SE z" is satisfied.

For the first condition, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). From "x is E of y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x), and from "y is S of z", we have supx(y) <= supx(z). But these constraints don't directly tell us the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). It's possible that supx(z) > infx(x), in which case "x SE z" would not hold. But it's also possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), in which case "x SE z" would hold. So, "x SE z" is a possible relation.

Now, let's check "x S z". For "x S z" to hold, we need:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z)

Checking the first condition, from the above analysis, we already have supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the second condition, from "y is S of z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y), and from "x is E of y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x). It's possible that infx(z) > infx(x), in which case "x S z" would not hold. But it's also possible that infx(z) <= infx(x), in which case the second condition would be satisfied.

For the third condition, we need supx(x) <= supx(z). From our constraints, we don't have a direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). It's possible that supx(x) > supx(z), in which case "x S z" would not hold. But it's also possible that supx(x) <= supx(z), in which case the third condition would be satisfied.

So, "x S z" is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

OK I think I've been making this way more complicated than needed. Let me approach this differently. I'll place z at the origin, and then consider the defined constraint "y is S of z". From there, I'll further constrain where x can be given "x is E of y".

So:
- z is placed at the origin, denoted by (0, 0).
- Given "y is S of z", y must be below z without any overlap in y-coordinates. This means supy(y) <= infy(z).
- Given "x is E of y", x must be to the right of y without any overlap in x-coordinates. This means supx(y) <= infx(x).

Given that y is S of z, y can be:
1. Directly below z (S of z), where infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
2. Below and to the left of z (SW of z), where supx(y) <= infx(z).
3. Below and to the right of z (SE of z), where supx(z) <= infx(y).

Let's consider each case and see where x can be:

Case 1: If y is directly below z (S of z), then:
- We know that supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z).
- We know that infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-extent is within z's x-extent).
- Given that x is E of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y).
- This means infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).

In this case, x can be:
- SE of z: This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x). But from our constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't directly give us the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).
- S of z: This is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). From the constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), but we don't know the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

Case 2: If y is SW of z (below and to the left of z), then:
- We know that supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z).
- We know that supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z).
- Given that x is E of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y).
- This means supx(y) <= min(infx(z), infx(x)).

In this case, x can be:
- SE of z: This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x). But we don't have a direct constraint for this.
- S of z: This is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But as supx(y) <= infx(z), it's possible for x to start anywhere to the right of infx(z).
- E of z: This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). from supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), this would require supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z), which is a contradiction. So "x E z" is NOT possible.
- NE of z: This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But from supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), we have supy(x) <= infy(z). This means infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z), which contradicts the second condition. So "x NE z" is NOT possible.
- N of z: This is possible if supy(z) <= infy(x) (and the horizontals match). But from the above, we see that this is not possible.
- W of z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(y) <= infx(x).
- SW of z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, supx(y) <= infx(x). This means supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x), and we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But from supy(y) <= infx(z), we have supx(y) <= infx(z). If supx(y) < infx(z), it's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z). So, "x SW z" is a possible relation.

I realized I made a mistake in my analysis. I said supx(y) <= infx(z), but that's not correct. From "y is SW of z", we have supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z). Sorry for the confusion.

Case 3: If y is SE of z (below and to the right of z), then:
- We know that supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z).
- We know that supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z).
- Given that x is E of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y).
- This means supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).

In this case, x can be:
- SE of z: Given the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), the first condition for "x SE z" is satisfied. And from supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), the second condition is also satisfied. So "x SE z" holds.
- S of z: This is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). The first condition is met. But for the second condition, we would need supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction. So "x S z" is NOT possible.
- E of z: This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is satisfied. For the second and third, we have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). This means supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z), which contradicts the third condition. So "x E z" is NOT possible.

OK I need to halt for a sec. I just realized I'm messing up in a fundamental way. If y is S of z, y might not be exactly one cardinal and might span multiple cardinal regions. Let's take a step back. 

From "y is S of z", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z).
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-extent is within z's x-extent).

Wait, now I'm confused. The definition of "a S b" states "a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)". So where did I get the constraints wrong?

For "y S z", we should have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z).
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left of y is not to the left of the left of z).
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right of y is not to the right of the right of z).

For "x E y", we should have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y).
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of y).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not above the top of y).

Let me double-check all of the configurations.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z).
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z).

Let's see if these conditions are met. From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). From "y S z", we have supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't give us a direct relation between supx(z) and infx(x). So, the first condition is not guaranteed.

From "x E y", we have supy(x) <= supy(y). From "y S z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z). Combining these, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). So, the second condition is always met.

For "x SE z" to hold, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), which is not guaranteed by our constraints. But it's possible. So "x SE z" is a possible relation.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z).
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left of x is not to the left of the left of z).
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right of x is not to the right of the right of z).

From the above, we already established that supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the second condition, from "y S z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y). From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). These constraints don't give us a direct relation between infx(z) and infx(x). So, the second condition is not guaranteed.

For the third condition, from "y S z", we have supx(y) <= supx(z). From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). These constraints don't give us a direct relation between supx(x) and supx(z). So, the third condition is not guaranteed.

For "x S z" to hold, we need both the second and third conditions to be met, which are not guaranteed by our constraints. But they are both possible. So "x S z" is a possible relation.

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z).
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z).
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z).

From the above, the first condition is not guaranteed.

For the second condition, from "y S z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z). From "x E y", we have infy(y) <= infy(x). But these don't give us a direct relation between infy(z) and infy(x).

For the third condition, from "x E y", we have supy(x) <= supy(y). From "y S z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z). Combining these, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). Since infy(z) < supy(z), we have supy(x) < supy(z), and the third condition is met.

For "x E z" to hold, we need both the first and second conditions to be met, which are not guaranteed by our constraints. So "x E z" is a possible relation.

Acutally, let me check the third condition again. For x to be E of z, the third condition is supy(x) <= supy(z). We derived supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z). This confirms that the third condition for "x E z" is always satisfied.

But, as I was tracing through this, I realized I missed something. From "y S z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z). From "x E y", we have supy(x) <= supy(y). This means supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) for "x E z". So, "x E z" is NOT a possible relation.

I'm going to work through the remaining direction(s) more carefully.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z).
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z).

The first condition is not guaranteed, as we've seen.

For the second condition, from "y S z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z). From "x E y", we have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). This means infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) < supy(z), which contradicts the second condition for "x NE z". So, "x NE z" is NOT a possible relation.

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z).
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left of x is not to the left of the left of z).
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right of x is not to the right of the right of z).

The first condition is contradicted, as we've seen. So, "x N z" is NOT a possible relation.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z).
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z).

The second condition is contradicted, as we've seen. So, "x NW z" is NOT a possible relation.

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z).
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z).
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z).

From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). From "y S z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y). This means infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x), which contradicts the first condition for "x W z". So, "x W z" is NOT a possible relation.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z).
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z).

The first condition is contradicted, as we've seen. The second condition is met, as we've seen. But for "x SW z" to hold, both conditions need to be met, which is not the case. So, "x SW z" is NOT a possible relation.

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left of x is not to the left of the left of z).
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right of x is not to the right of the right of z).
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z).
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z).

From the analysis above, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). This means supy(x) < infy(z) < supy(z), which contradicts the fourth condition for "x B z". So, "x B z" is NOT a possible relation.

Given our constraints, it seems that only "x SE z" and "x S z" are possible relations.

Actually, let me quickly check one more time whether "x SE z" is truly possible. For this, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We already established that supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the first condition, from "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). From "y S z", we have supx(y) <= supx(z). This gives us supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)).

If infx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(z) < infx(x), then supx(y) <= supx(z). This gives us supx(y) <= supx(z) < infx(x), which means "x SE z" holds.

For "x SE z" to hold, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), which is not guaranteed by our constraints. But it's possible. So "x SE z" is a possible relation.

Now, let's recheck "x S z". For this, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We already established that supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the second condition, from "y S z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y). From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't directly give us a relation between infx(z) and infx(x). But it's possible for infx(z) <= infx(x).

Let me check if there's any contradictions involved, if we assume infx(z) > infx(x) and say that the second condition of "x S z" doesn't hold.

If infx(z) > infx(x), then infx(z) > infx(x) >= supx(y) (from "x E y"). But from "y S z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y). This is a contradiction. So the second condition will always be satisfied.

Wait, let's be more careful. From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x), but this doesn't guarantee that infx(x) >= infx(y). In fact, it's possible for infx(x) < infx(y). So, the contradiction I derived is not valid.

For the second condition, we need infx(z) <= infx(x). From "y S z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y). But from our constraints, we don't have a direct relation between infx(y) and infx(x).

If infx(y) <= infx(x), then infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), and the second condition for "x S z" is met. If infx(x) < infx(y), then we don't have a direct relation between infx(z) and infx(x). In this case, it's possible for infx(z) > infx(x), in which case the second condition for "x S z" is not met. But it's also possible for infx(z) <= infx(x), in which case the condition is met.

For the third condition, we need supx(x) <= supx(z). From "y S z", we have supx(y) <= supx(z). But from our constraints, we don't have a direct relation between supx(y) and supx(x). It's possible for supx(x) > supx(z), in which case the third condition for "x S z" is not met. But it's also possible for supx(x) <= supx(z), in which case the condition is met.

For "x S z" to hold, we need both the second and third conditions to be met, which are not guaranteed by our constraints. But they are both possible. So "x S z" is a possible relation.

Let me double-check "x S z" one more time. For this, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the second condition, I'll approach differently. From "y S z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y). From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). These don't directly give us a relation between infx(z) and infx(x). But it's possible for infx(z) <= infx(x).

For the third condition, from "y S z", we have supx(y) <= supx(z). From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). These don't give us a direct relation between supx(x) and supx(z). But it's possible for supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, "x S z" is a possible relation.

Alright, so the only possible relations between x and z are "x SE z" and "x S z".

But wait, the conditions for x to be SE of z are:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z).
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z).

Given the constraints, the second condition is always met. The first condition is possible, but not guaranteed. This means "x SE z" is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

From "y S z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). But I can't compare infx(x) and supx(z). If supx(z) >= infx(x) then "x SE z" does not hold. If supx(z) < infx(x), then "x SE z" holds.

Ah, I think I misunderstood the definition of A SE B earlier, or I wasn't rigorous enough. Let me redefine it.

"a SE b" if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
"a S b" if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

Given the constraints "x E y" and "y S z":

For "x SE z", we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). For the first condition, we don't have a direct comparison from our constraints. So, "x SE z" is a possible relation.

For "x S z", we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). 

From "y S z", we have infx(z) <= infx(y). From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). These don't directly give us a relation between infx(z) and infx(x). But it's possible for infx(z) <= infx(x).

From "y S z", we have supx(y) <= supx(z). From "x E y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x). These don't give us a direct relation between supx(x) and supx(z). But it's possible for supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, "x S z" is a possible relation.

Alright, so the only possible relations between x and z are "x SE z" and "x S z".

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z based on the given constraints.

Given:
- x is E of y
- y is S of z

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:

From "x is E of y", we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of x is not below bottom of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x is not above top of y)

From "y is S of z", we have:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (left of y is not to the left of left of z)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (right of y is not to the right of right of z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

Now I'll check each possible relation:

For SE relation, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
The second condition is satisfied. The first condition is possible but not guaranteed.

For S relation, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
The first condition is satisfied. The second and third conditions are possible but not guaranteed.

For all other relations (E, NE, N, NW, W, SW, B), at least one required condition is contradicted by our constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SE
