PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this. We are given:
1. Region x is S of region y
2. Region y is S of region z

Let's recall what "S" (South) means:
a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) <= infy(b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)

Here, supy(a) is the supremum (or maximum) of the projection of region a on the y-axis, infy(b) is the infimum (or minimum) of the projection of region b on the y-axis, etc.

Let's apply this definition to the given relations:

For "x is S of y", we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

For "y is S of z", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the first two relations, we get:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from "x is S of y")
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from "y is S of z")

Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This implies that supy(x) <= infy(z), which is one of the conditions for x to be S of z.

Let's also consider the x-axis constraints:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from "x is S of y")
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from "x is S of y")
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y is S of z")
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from "y is S of z")

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This gives us:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

These are the other two conditions for x to be S of z.

So, based on the conditions, x is S of z, i.e. 'S' is a possible relation between x and z.

Wait, let me double-check. We have:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (derived from supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z))
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (derived from infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x))
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (derived from supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

Yes, these are the conditions for x to be S of z.

But we should also check if other relations are possible.

For x to be SW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), but we can't determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) from the given information. So, x being SW of z is a possibility.

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Again, we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), but we can't determine the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x) from the given information. So, x being SE of z is a possibility.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. Let me draw a rough diagram to visualize the situation.

Imagine the y-axis going from bottom to top, and the x-axis going from left to right.

If x is S of y:
- x is below y
- x is "sandwiched" within the x-projection of y

If y is S of z:
- y is below z
- y is "sandwiched" within the x-projection of z

Now, this does imply that x is below z, satisfying supy(x) <= infy(z).

But regarding the x-projections, we have:
- x is "sandwiched" within the x-projection of y, i.e., infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is "sandwiched" within the x-projection of z, i.e., infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This implies that x is "sandwiched" within the x-projection of z, i.e., infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

Wait, I've been making a mistake: the definition for S says the region is sandwiched horizontally within the reference region. But now I'm sandwiching the reference region z within the region x. That doesn't make sense, so I think I'm making a logical error.

Let's go back to the definition of "S":
a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is below b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a) (a's left edge is to the right of or at b's left edge)
- supx(a) <= supx(b) (a's right edge is to the left of or at b's right edge)

For "x is S of y", we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

For "y is S of z", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

Now, what can we infer about the relation between x and z?

From the y-axis constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from "x is S of y")
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from "y is S of z")
Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

From the x-axis constraints:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from "x is S of y")
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y is S of z")
Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of or at x's left edge)

And:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from "x is S of y")
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from "y is S of z")
Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

But for x to be S of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z) - This is satisfied.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge) - This might not be satisfied based on our derived infx(z) <= infx(x).
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge) - This is satisfied.

Wait, let me make sure I've interpreted the condition correctly: 
a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is below b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a) (a's left edge is to the right of or at b's left edge)
- supx(a) <= supx(b) (a's right edge is to the left of or at b's right edge)

Re-reading the original definition, "infx(b) <= infx(a)" does indeed mean that a's left boundary is to the right of or at b's left boundary.

For "x is S of y", we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

For "y is S of z", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

Combining these, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of or at y's left edge, which is to the left of or at x's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge, which is to the left of or at z's right edge)

Now, for x to be S of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) - This is satisfied.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) - This is satisfied (from our derivation: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)).
- supx(x) <= supx(z) - This is satisfied (from our derivation: supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)).

So, x is S of z is a possibility!

Now, let's check if x can be SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z), but we cannot determine if supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x being SW of z is a possibility.

Actually, hang on. Let's revisit the constraints on the x-axis, since there's a potential mistake:

For "x is S of y", we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

For "y is S of z", we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (This implies that x's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge.)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (This implies that x's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge.)

Now, for x to be S of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) - This is satisfied.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) - This is satisfied.
- supx(x) <= supx(z) - This is satisfied.

So, x is S of z is a possibility.

For x to be SW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z), but from our derivation, supx(x) <= supx(z). We can't determine if supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x being SW of z remains a possibility.

Actually, if x is entirely to the left of z (i.e., supx(x) <= infx(z)), then it would be SW of z (given that x is below z). But if x is partially overlapping with z in terms of x-projection (which is allowed by the S relation), then x would be S of z.

I think I'm a bit confused here. Let me approach it from a more graphical viewpoint.

If "x is S of y", then x is below y. The horizontal projection of x is contained within the horizontal projection of y, but x can be shifted to the right or left as long as it doesn't go beyond the horizontal boundaries of y.

If "y is S of z", then y is below z. The horizontal projection of y is contained within the horizontal projection of z, but y can be shifted to the right or left as long as it doesn't go beyond the horizontal boundaries of z.

So, we have:
- x is below y
- y is below z
- x's horizontal projection is contained within y's
- y's horizontal projection is contained within z's

This implies:
- x is below z
- x's horizontal projection is contained within z's (since x's is contained within y's, which is contained within z's)

So, x can be S of z.

But, can x be SW of z? For x to be SW of z, x would need to be entirely to the left of z and below z. Given that x is below z, we need to check if x can be entirely to the left of z.

Since the horizontal projection of x is contained within the horizontal projection of y, and the horizontal projection of y is contained within the horizontal projection of z, the horizontal projection of x is contained within the horizontal projection of z. This means x cannot be entirely to the left of z unless z's left boundary is located at or to the right of x's right boundary, which would require

supx(x) <= infx(z)

But from our derivations, we can only infer:

supx(x) <= supx(z)

So, we cannot determine if x is SW of z from the given information.

Similarly, to find out if x is SE of z, we need to verify if x is to the right of z. 

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z), but from our derivation, infx(z) <= infx(x). We can't determine if supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x being SE of z remains a possibility.

Actually, if x's horizontal projection is contained within z's, then the x-projection range [infx(x), supx(x)] is a subset of the z-projection range [infx(z), supx(z)]. This means infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). 

Given infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), we cannot have supx(z) <= infx(x) (which would imply x is to the right of z), nor can we have supx(x) <= infx(z) (which would imply x is to the left of z). So, x cannot be SE or SW of z.

Now, let's check if x can be in other positions relative to z.

For x to be W of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've established that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), which means supy(x) <= supy(z), but also supy(x) <= infy(z). The latter contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for the W relation. So, x is not W of z.

For x to be E of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

As with the W relation, the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x is not E of z.

For x to be NW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've established that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), which contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for the NW relation. So, x is not NW of z.

Similarly, for x to be N, NE, or B of z, we would need constraints that are contradicted by the fact that x is below z. So, x is not N, NE, or B of z.

In summary, from the given information:
- x is S of z is a possibility.
- x is SW, SE, W, E, NW, N, NE, or B of z is not possible.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. I keep saying that x's horizontal projection is contained within z's, but that's not necessarily true. 

Let me go back to the original definitions and constraints:

For "x is S of y", we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

For "y is S of z", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

Let's see what we can infer about the constraints between x and z:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) => infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) => supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

These are exactly the requirements for x to be S of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

So, x is definitely S of z.

Let's also check explicitly if x could be SW, SE, or any other relation with z:

For x to be SW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

While the second condition is met, the first condition would require supx(x) <= infx(z). But from our derivation, we know supx(x) <= supx(z), which doesn't necessarily imply supx(x) <= infx(z). In fact, if the x-projection of z is [infx(z), supx(z)], and the x-projection of x is [infx(x), supx(x)], with infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection. This means x cannot be completely to the left of z, so x is not SW of z.

Similarly, for x to be SE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

The second condition is met, but the first condition would require supx(z) <= infx(x). But from our derivation, we know infx(z) <= infx(x), which doesn't necessarily imply supx(z) <= infx(x). In fact, it's contradictory. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then the x-projection of x is [infx(x), supx(x)], and the x-projection of z is [infx(z), supx(z)]. With these constraints, x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection, and x cannot be completely to the right of z. So, x is not SE of z.

For the other directions, we've already established that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), which means x cannot be W, NW, N, NE, E, or B of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is S.

Actually, let's make doubly sure of our conclusion. The constraints imply that x's horizontal projection is within z's horizontal projection, so x cannot be to the left or right of z. But let's verify:

For "x is S of y", we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

For "y is S of z", we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) => infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of or at x's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) => supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

Now, for x to be SW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)

But from our derivation, infx(z) <= infx(x). This means:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left boundary is to the left of or at x's left boundary)
- supx(x) would need to be to the left of infx(z) for x to be SW of z

If x's left boundary (infx(x)) is to the right of z's left boundary (infx(z)), then x's right boundary (supx(x)) must be to the right of z's left boundary (infx(z)) as well (given the definition of infx and supx). This means supx(x) cannot be to the left of infx(z), so x cannot be SW of z.

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z)

But from our derivation, supx(x) <= supx(z). This means:
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)
- infx(x) would need to be to the right of supx(z) for x to be SE of z

If x's right boundary (supx(x)) is to the left of z's right boundary (supx(z)), then x's left boundary (infx(x)) must be to the left of z's right boundary (supx(z)) as well (given the definition of infx and supx). This means infx(x) cannot be to the right of supx(z), so x cannot be SE of z.

For other directions (W, NW, N, NE, E, B), they would all require x to not be entirely below z, but we've established that x is below z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is S.

Wait, let me just double-check this by thinking about the problem visually.

If "x is S of y", then x is below y, and x's horizontal projection is within y's. Similarly, if "y is S of z", then y is below z, and y's horizontal projection is within z's.

This means:
- x is below y, which is below z, so x is below z.
- x's horizontal projection is within y's, which is within z's. So, x's horizontal projection is within z's.

For x to be S of z, exactly these conditions need to be met. 

So, from the given information, the only possible relation between x and z is S.

Alright, I think I have over-analyzed this! Let's just review the core constraints for clarity:

For "x is S of y", we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

For "y is S of z", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of or at x's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

These constraints match the requirements for the S relation between x and z. And as I've checked, the other relations (SW, SE, W, NW, N, NE, E, B) are not possible based on these constraints.

So, the possible relation between x and z is S.

Wait, let me think about this again. It seems I might have been too restrictive.

For "x is S of y", we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

For "y is S of z", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

The combination of these constraints gives us:

1. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (chaining the inequalities)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (chaining the inequalities)

From 2 and 3, we get infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

Now, let's use these to determine the relation between x and z.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) - This is satisfied from 1.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) - This is satisfied from 2.
- supx(x) <= supx(z) - This is satisfied from 3.

So, x is S of z is a possibility.

Now, let's double check:

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

The second condition is satisfied, but the first condition requires supx(x) <= infx(z). This isn't a direct consequence of our constraints.

From our constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) (from 2) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (from 3).

Now, there are a few possible arrangements of these boundaries:
1. infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x) < supx(z): In this case, x's horizontal projection is entirely within z's horizontal projection. This is the S relation.
2. infx(z) = infx(x) < supx(x) < supx(z): Here, x's left edge aligns with z's left edge, but x's horizontal projection is still within z's. This is the S relation.
3. infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x) = supx(z): Here, x's right edge aligns with z's right edge, but x's horizontal projection is still within z's. This is the S relation.
4. infx(z) = infx(x) < supx(x) = supx(z): Here, both the left and right edges of x align with z. This is the S relation.

There's another possibility to consider:
5. supx(x) <= infx(z): In this case, x is entirely to the left of z. This is the SW relation.

But is this consistent with our constraints? From 2, we have infx(z) <= infx(x). For supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, we need supx(x) <= infx(x), which would mean the right boundary of x is to the left of its left boundary. This is a contradiction.

So, x being SW of z is not a possibility.

Similarly, let's check if x can be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

The second condition is satisfied, but the first condition requires supx(z) <= infx(x). This isn't a direct consequence of our constraints.

From our constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) (from 2) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (from 3).

For supx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), which simplifies to supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x).

This is a degenerate case where x is a vertical line at the right boundary of z. This could be considered a special case of SE, but it's not the typical SE relation where x is strictly to the right of z.

OK, let me make sure I really understand what cardinal directions mean in the context of regions. 

For regions a and b, the cardinal directions are defined as follows:

a B b if and only if:
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a)
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) <= infy(b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)

a SW b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b)
- supy(a) <= infy(b)

a W b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a)
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

a NW b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a)

a N b if and only if:
- supy(b) <= infy(a)
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)

a NE b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a)
- supy(b) <= infy(a)

a E b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a)
- infy(b) <= infy(a)
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

a SE b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a)
- supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now, given:
- x is S of y
- y is S of z

Let's combine the constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x is S of y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is S of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x is S of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y is S of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is S of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y is S of z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is vertically below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the right of z's right boundary)

Now, let's check each cardinal direction for the relation between x and z:

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) - Satisfied
- infx(z) <= infx(x) - Satisfied
- supx(x) <= supx(z) - Satisfied
So, x S z is possible.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) - For this to be true, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (using the constraints). This leads to supx(x) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction for a non-empty region.
- supy(x) <= infy(z) - Satisfied
So, x SW z is not possible.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) - For this to be true, we need supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) (using the constraints). But from infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(y) being the left boundary of y, we know that infx(x) is to the right of the left boundary of y. It's not clear if supx(z) <= infx(x) can be simultaneously satisfied.
- supy(x) <= infy(z) - Satisfied

For x to be SE of z, the second condition is already satisfied. For the first condition, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). Given our existing constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary). 

For supx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, and given that infx(x) <= supx(x) (by definition, the left boundary of x is to the left of or at the right boundary of x), we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z). This means supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x), which is a degenerate case where x is a vertical line.

Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, they have non-empty interiors. This means they can't just be a line. Therefore, x SE z is not possible.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) - This is the same constraint as for SW, which we've already shown to be impossible.
- infy(z) <= infy(x) - For this to be true, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (using the constraints). This leads to infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), which means infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). This implies infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z), which is a degenerate case where x is a horizontal line.
- supy(a) <= supy(b) - Satisfied
Given the argument for infy(z) <= infy(x) above, and the nature of regions in REG, x W z is not possible.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) - This is the same constraint as for SW, which we've already shown to be impossible.
- supy(z) <= infy(x) - For this to be true, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) (using the constraints). This leads to supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x's bottom boundary is above its top boundary, which is a contradiction.
So, x NW z is not possible.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) - This is the same constraint as for NW, which we've already shown to be impossible.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) - Satisfied
- supx(x) <= supx(z) - Satisfied
Given the argument for supy(z) <= infy(x) above, x N z is not possible.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) - This is the same constraint as for SE, which we've already shown to be impossible.
- supy(z) <= infy(x) - This is the same constraint as for NW, which we've already shown to be impossible.
So, x NE z is not possible.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) - This is the same constraint as for SE, which we've already shown to be impossible.
- infy(z) <= infy(x) - This is the same constraint as for W, which we've already shown to be impossible.
- supy(x) <= supy(z) - Satisfied
Given the arguments for supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) above, x E z is not possible.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) - Satisfied
- supx(x) <= supx(z) - Satisfied
- infy(z) <= infy(x) - This is the same constraint as for W, which we've already shown to be impossible.
- supy(x) <= supy(z) - Satisfied
Given the argument for infy(z) <= infy(x) above, x B z is not possible.

In summary, only x S z is possible.

OK I'm really not sure why I was struggling with this. Let me try once more, very clearly:

Given:
- x is S of y
- y is S of z

For x S y, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's horizontal projection is "sandwiched" within y's)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's horizontal projection is "sandwiched" within y's)

For y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's horizontal projection is "sandwiched" within z's)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's horizontal projection is "sandwiched" within z's)

Combining the constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y) => infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's horizontal projection is "sandwiched" within z's)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) => supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's horizontal projection is "sandwiched" within z's)

These three conditions are exactly what we need for x S z.

Let's check the other directions to be sure:

For x to be SW of z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z). But from our constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(x) (by definition), which means infx(z) <= supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

For x to be SE of z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x). But from our constraints, supx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(x) <= supx(x) (by definition), which means infx(x) <= supx(z). This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x SE z is not possible.

For x to be W of z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is the same as for SW, which we've already shown to be impossible. So, x W z is not possible.

For x to be E of z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is the same as for SE, which we've already shown to be impossible. So, x E z is not possible.

For x to be N of z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We have supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) (from the constraints), which means supy(x) <= supy(z). For supy(z) <= infy(x) to be true, we'd need supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). But by definition, infy(x) <= supy(x), which gives us infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This means infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z), which is a degenerate case. So, for regions in REG which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, x N z is not possible.

Based on similar arguments, x NW z, x NE z, and x B z are also not possible.

Therefore, from the given information, the possible relation between x and z is S.

Given that we are looking at regions that are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk.

From the given information "x is S of y" and "y is S of z", we have established that:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's horizontal projection is "sandwiched" within z's)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's horizontal projection is "sandwiched" within z's)

These three conditions match the requirements for the S relation between x and z. They also eliminate the possibility of x being in any other relation to z, as we've shown.

So, the relation between x and z is S.

Oh wait, I had one more incorrect interpretation for SW. Let's fix this.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

The first condition is satisfied from our constraints. For the second condition, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) (from our constraints) and infx(x) <= supx(x) (by definition). This gives us infx(z) <= supx(x), which does not necessarily contradict supx(x) <= infx(z). They are only contradictory if infx(z) < supx(x), but if infx(z) = supx(x), then both can be true.

So, if x's right boundary exactly aligns with z's left boundary, then x SW z is possible.

But this is a degenerate case where x is touching z only at the point where x's rightmost point and z's leftmost point coincide. Given that regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, this makes it connected.

Actually, let me revisit the definitions.

For SW, the formal definition is:

a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

This means a (the first region) is to the left of and below b (the second region). There's no stipulation that they can't touch at a point.

Now, from our constraints, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z) - This is consistent with SW.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary) - This is not immediately consistent or inconsistent with SW.
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary) - This is not immediately consistent or inconsistent with SW.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z). If supx(x) < infx(z), then there's a clear separation between x and z in the x-direction. If supx(x) = infx(z), then x and z touch at a point.

Given our derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x), for x SW z to be possible, we'd need:

infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z)

This simplifies to infx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x). This means x is degenerate in the x-direction, which is not consistent with regions in REG (which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk).

So, x SW z is not possible.

Similarly, we have already shown that x in other directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is either consistent or inconsistent with the constraints.

The only direction that is fully consistent with the derived constraints (supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)) is S.

Therefore, the possible relation between x and z is S.

Actually, I still believe it might be worth revisiting the analysis for SW:

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

From our constraints, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)

For supx(x) <= infx(z) to be consistent with infx(z) <= infx(x), we need:

supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x)

For a region x (which is non-degenerate), we know infx(x) < supx(x). This means:

infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x)

This gives us infx(x) < infx(x), which is a contradiction.

OK so, the relation between x and z is S.

OK, I was overthinking due to the phrasing "which could be the possible relations." Let's summarize:

Given:
- x is S of y
- y is S of z

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's horizontal projection is "sandwiched" within z's)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's horizontal projection is "sandwiched" within z's)

These conditions match exactly the S relation between x and z. Through our detailed analysis, we've also shown that these conditions preclude x from being in any other relation to z (N, NE, E, SE, SW, W, NW, B).

Therefore, the possible relation between x and z is S.

Actually let me make a final check on the most likely candidates:

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) - Satisfied from our constraints.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) - Satisfied from our constraints.
- supx(x) <= supx(z) - Satisfied from our constraints.
So, x S z is possible.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) - Satisfied from our constraints.
- supx(x) <= infx(z) - This would need to be true along with infx(z) <= infx(x) from our constraints. But for any non-degenerate region, infx(x) < supx(x), which means we need infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z). This is a contradiction.
So, x SW z is not possible.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) - Satisfied from our constraints.
- supx(z) <= infx(x) - This would need to be true along with supx(x) <= supx(z) from our constraints. But for any non-degenerate region, infx(x) < supx(x), which means we need supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z). This is a contradiction.
So, x SE z is not possible.

Therefore, from the given information, the only possible relation between x and z is S.

So my answer is: S.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- region x is S of region y
- region y is S of region z

From the first relation (x is S of y), we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

From the second relation (y is S of z), we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) → supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) → infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) → supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge)

These three conditions exactly match the requirements for the S relation between x and z.

The answer is: S
