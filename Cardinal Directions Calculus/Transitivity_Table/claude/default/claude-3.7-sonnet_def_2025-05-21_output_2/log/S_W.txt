PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

We know:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is W of region z

We want to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's use the definitions provided:

1. x S y means:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

2. y W z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let's see what constraints these place on the relation between x and z.

First, let's understand the position of x relative to z on the x-axis:
- From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Combining these:
supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which implies that x is completely to the left of z on the x-axis. This is consistent with cardinal directions W, SW, or NW.

Now, let's understand the position of x relative to z on the y-axis:
- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means supy(x) ≤ supy(z), but we cannot conclusively determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z) from the given constraints.

However, we do know one important relationship:
From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Thus, supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

This tells us that x is completely below z on the y-axis. This is consistent with cardinal directions S, SW, or SE.

Combining the constraints on both axes:
- x is completely to the left of z (W, SW, or NW)
- x is completely below z (S, SW, or SE)

The only direction that satisfies both conditions is SW. So the relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, let me verify this more carefully by thinking about the entire coordinate system.

If x is S of y, then x is below y. If y is W of z, then y is to the left of z.

Now, let's visualize:
```
     |
     |
  z  |
-----|-----
     |
  y  |
-----|-----
     |
  x  |
     |
```

From this visualization, indeed x appears to be SW of z. But let's double-check using the formal definitions.

SW means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

From our previous derivations:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is completely below z)

Therefore, x is SW of z.

Let me verify this with a slightly different visualization to be thorough:

```
     z
     |
     |
y----|
     |
     |
     x
```

If x is S of y, and y is W of z, then x is to the bottom-left of z, which corresponds to the SW direction.

Hmm, but now I'm questioning this. Let's be even more precise by using the coordinate constraints more explicitly.

Given:
- x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) => supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) => supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, the tricky part is determining the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) directly. From the given constraints, we know:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But from these, we can't directly determine whether supy(x) ≤ infy(z) or infy(z) ≤ supy(x).

If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is completely below z, making the relation SW.
But if infy(z) ≤ supy(x), then there's some vertical overlap between x and z, making the relation W.

Actually, let's think about this further. We have:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can't directly determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). Both of the following scenarios are consistent with the given constraints:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This would mean x is completely below z, resulting in the relation SW.
2. infy(z) ≤ supy(x): This would mean there's some vertical overlap between x and z, and since x is completely to the left of z, the relation would be W.

So, based on the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

Actually, let's consider even more carefully. We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely to the left of z. This is consistent with cardinal directions W, SW, or NW.

For the y-axis, we have:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can't directly determine the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z). All we know is supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Let's consider the possible relative positions of x and z on the y-axis:

1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is completely below z. Combined with the x-axis constraint, this means x is SW of z.
2. infy(z) ≤ supy(x) and infy(x) ≤ infy(z): There's some vertical overlap, with the bottom of z within the vertical span of x. Combined with the x-axis constraint, this means x is W of z.
3. infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z): There's vertical overlap, with the bottom of z above the bottom of x and the top of x below the top of z. This is still consistent with x being W of z.
4. infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x): There's vertical overlap, with z entirely contained within the vertical span of x. This is still consistent with x being W of z.
5. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z): There's vertical overlap, with x entirely contained within the vertical span of z. This is still consistent with x being W of z.
6. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x): There's vertical overlap, with the top of z within the vertical span of x. This is still consistent with x being W of z.
7. supy(z) ≤ infy(x): z is completely below x. Combined with the x-axis constraint, this means x is NW of z.

OK, I think I got confused by trying to reason about too many variables at once.

Let's simplify this reasoning by representing the constraint that x is S of y:

```
      y
      |
      |
------|------
      |
      |
      x
```

And we also know that y is W of z:

```
   y      z
   |      |
   |      |
---|------|---
   |      |
   |      |
```

Combining these two, we get:

```
   y      z
   |      |
   |      |
---|------|---
   |      |
   |      |
   x
```

From this visualization, it seems like x can be SW of z, like this:

```
         z
         |
         |
   y     |
   |     |
   |     |
---|-----|---
   |     |
   |     |
   x
```

But x can also be W of z, like this:

```
         z
         |
         |
   y  x  |
   |  |  |
   |  |  |
---|--|--|---
   |  |  |
   |     |
```

Or even NW of z, like this:

```
      x
      |
      |
   y  |  z
   |  |  |
   |  |  |
---|--|--|---
   |     |
```

So, based on the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

Actually, one more thing to check. Let's review the constraints for x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

And for y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

I just realized that there's an additional constraint from x S y that I haven't been using: infx(y) ≤ infx(x). This means that the left boundary of x is to the right of or at the same level as the left boundary of y. 

To visualize this, let's show the left boundaries:

```
       z
       |
       |
  y    |
  |    |
  |    |
--|-----
  |
  |
 x|
```

With this constraint, it's possible for x to be directly below z, which would correspond to the S direction. Let's check if this is feasible:

From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Can infx(x) ≥ infx(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)? This would be necessary for x to be directly below z (S direction).

Let's see:
- From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

From these, we can derive:
infx(x) ≥ infx(y)
supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely to the left of z. This rules out the S direction.

Now, let's double-check the other directions:

For SW: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
We've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). For the y-axis, we know:
- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≥ infy(z)

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible for supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would make the direction SW, but it's also possible for supy(x) > infy(z), which would mean there's some vertical overlap.

For W: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
We already know supx(x) ≤ infx(z). For the y-axis, there's nothing in the given constraints that directly constrains infy(x) or suggests that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). Similarly, while we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which gives supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), indicating supy(x) ≤ supy(z), we don't know if there's vertical overlap between x and z. So W is possible.

For NW: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
Again, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z). For the y-axis, there's nothing in the given constraints that directly suggests supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So NW is also a possibilty.

Let's check for SE: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
From the previous derivations, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (assuming supx(z) ≥ infx(z), which is true for a valid region). So, SE is ruled out.

Let's check for S: We need infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
We've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, S is ruled out.

Let's check for B: We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
Again, we've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, B is ruled out.

Let's check for E: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
Just like for SE, from the previous derivations, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, E is ruled out.

Let's check for NE: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
Just like for SE and E, from the previous derivations, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, NE is ruled out.

Let's check for N: We need infy(x) ≤ infy(z), supy(z) ≤ supy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
Again, we've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, N is ruled out.

In summary, based on the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW. SE, S, B, E, NE, and N are all ruled out due to the horizontal constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

Wait, I think there's an issue with the way I've been thinking about the constraints. Let's revisit and focus on the exact constraints given for each relation.

For x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

For y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, what can we derive about the relationship between x and z?

For the x-axis:
From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Combining these:
infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely to the left of z on the x-axis.

For the y-axis:
From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≥ infy(z)
supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can't directly determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between infy(x) and supy(z). There are multiple possible scenarios:

1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is completely below z on the y-axis. Combined with the x-axis constraint, this gives the SW relation.
2. infy(z) ≤ supy(x) and infy(x) ≤ supy(z): There's vertical overlap between x and z. Combined with the x-axis constraint, this gives the W relation.
3. supy(z) ≤ infy(x): z is completely below x on the y-axis. Combined with the x-axis constraint, this gives the NW relation.

So, based on the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

Let me double-check the W relation. For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

We've already established supx(x) ≤ infx(z) from our derivations. For the y-axis, we have:
From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can derive supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

But for the W relation, we also need infy(z) ≤ infy(x). Can we derive this from the given constraints?
From x S y: We don't have any direct constraint on infy(x).
From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can't directly determine the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x). It could be that infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would make the W relation possible, but it could also be that infy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would rule out the W relation.

Similarly, for the NW relation, while we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), we don't have any direct constraint that suggests supy(z) ≤ infy(x). It could be the case, but it doesn't necessarily follow from the given constraints.

In fact, using only the given constraints, the only relation we can say with certainty is that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This rules out any relation where z is to the west of x (i.e., N, NE, E, SE, S). But we don't have enough constraints to pinpoint the exact relation between x and z among SW, W, and NW.

Actually, let's be more precise. I want to reason a bit more about the vertical relationship between x and z. 

From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can say:
- We know that x is completely below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).
- We know that the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y (infy(z) ≤ infy(y)).
- We know that the top of y is below or at the same level as the top of z (supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

From these, can we derive anything definitive about the relationship between x and z on the y-axis?

Actually, I think I was overcomplicating this. Let's think more visually.

If x is S of y, then x is below y. If y is W of z, then y is to the left of z. Combining these:

```
         z
         |
   y     |
   |     |
   |     |
   x
```

From this visualization, x can be SW, W, or NW of z, depending on how far up or down x is relative to z:

```
         z
         |
   y     |
   |     |
   |     |
   x
```

In this case, x is SW of z.

```
   y     z
   |     |
   |     |
   x
```

In this case, x is W of z.

```
   x
   |
   y     z
   |     |
   |     |
```

In this case, x is NW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

Let's try one more time to ensure clarity. 

Here's what we know:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is W of region z

Let's explore the possible relations between region x and region z.

By definition, if x is S of y, then:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is completely below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (y's left boundary is to the left of or at x's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at y's right boundary)

And if y is W of z, then:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's bottom boundary is below or at y's bottom boundary)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's top boundary is below or at z's top boundary)

Now, let's derive what this means for the relation between x and z:

For the x-axis:
- From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Combining these, we get:
infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which implies that x is completely to the left of z on the x-axis. This rules out E, NE, SE, B, N, and S as possible relations.

For the y-axis:
- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can say:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≥ infy(z)

This doesn't give us a definitive relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). Depending on their relative values, we can have different scenarios:

If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is SW of z.
If supy(x) > infy(z) and infy(x) < supy(z), then there's some vertical overlap between x and z, which means x is W of z.
If infy(x) ≥ supy(z), then x is above z, which means x is NW of z.

Given that we've eliminated E, NE, SE, B, N, and S, the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

OK, I double-checked and I think my conclusion is correct: the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW. Let me check once more time that these directions respect the original constraints. Looking to the possible directions involving x and z:

1. SW: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). 
   We've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z). For the y-axis, if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then SW is a possible relation.

2. W: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z). For the y-axis, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But we don't have a constraint directly linking infy(z) to infy(x). However, if infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then W is a possible relation.

3. NW: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   We've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z). For the y-axis, if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then NW is a possible relation.

So, indeed, the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW, depending on the specific placement of the regions within the constraints.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

SW, W, NW

Explanation:
- When x is S of y, x is completely below y
- When y is W of z, y is completely to the left of z
- Combining these constraints, we know that x must be to the left of z (because x is at most as far right as y, and y is to the left of z)
- However, the vertical relationship between x and z can vary:
  - x could be below z (giving SW relation)
  - x could overlap with z vertically (giving W relation)
  - x could be above z (giving NW relation)
