PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's go through this step by step.

Given:
- Region x is B (bounding box) of region y
- Region y is NE (North East) of region z

Based on the definitions:
- x B y means that x is inside the bounding box of y. Specifically:
  * infx(y) <= infx(x)
  * supx(x) <= supx(y)
  * infy(y) <= infy(x)
  * supy(x) <= supy(y)

- y NE z means that y is in the North East direction of z. Specifically:
  * supx(z) <= infx(y)
  * supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, we need to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's analyze the constraints:
1. From x B y:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. From y NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
  So, supx(z) <= infx(x)

- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
  So, supy(z) <= infy(x)

These two constraints say that:
- x is to the right of z (since the maximum x-coordinate of z is less than the minimum x-coordinate of x)
- x is above z (since the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than the minimum y-coordinate of x)

Given these, region x could be in:
- NE (North East) of region z.

However, I need to be careful here. While x is definitely to the north-east of z based on our constraints, there's more to cardinal directions than just these inequalities. Let's think about it more carefully.

The constraints we derived are:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

If we look at the definition of NE:
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

So, x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

And that's exactly the constraint we derived. So, region x is NE of region z.

But wait, I need to double-check if there are other possible relations. Let's think about each direction:

- N: a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, N is not confirmed.

- NW: a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know if supx(x) <= infx(z). In fact, we know the opposite: supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be NW of z.

- W: a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
  We don't know if supx(x) <= infx(z), and we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the second condition for W. So, x cannot be W of z.

- SW: a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the second condition for SW. So, x cannot be SW of z.

- S: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the first condition for S. So, x cannot be S of z.

- SE: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
  We know supx(z) <= infx(x), but we also know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the second condition for SE. So, x cannot be SE of z.

- E: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
  We know supx(z) <= infx(x) and we also know supy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know if supy(x) <= supy(z). In fact, from supy(z) <= infy(x), we can infer that supy(z) <= supy(x), but we don't know if they're equal or if supy(z) < supy(x). So, the third condition for E is not confirmed. Hence, x cannot be definitively said to be E of z.

- B: a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
  We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for B. So, x cannot be B of z.

Actually, let's be more careful. Let's rederive the constraints more carefully. We know:
1. From x B y:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. From y NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)

From (1) and (2), we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
  So, supx(z) <= infx(x)

- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
  So, supy(z) <= infy(x)

So, x is definitely to the north-east of z. But the question is: Can x be in any other direction relative to z? Let's analyze:

From the derivation, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is strictly to the right of z (or the most) to the east of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is strictly above z (or at the most) to the north of z.

Given these strict inequalities, x can potentially be in one of these directions relative to z:
- NE: x is to the north-east of z.
- N: x is to the north of z, but not necessarily to the east.
- E: x is to the east of z, but not necessarily to the north.
- B: x is inside the bounding box of z.

For x to be to the N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we know is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which we don't know)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which we don't know)

For x to be to the E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we know is true)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we don't know)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we don't know)

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which we don't know)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which we don't know)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we don't know)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we don't know)

For B, we get four things we don't know, and for one thing we know for the N and E cases. Let me try a different approach by constructing specific configurations that are consistent with the given constraints (x B y and y NE z) and see which relations between x and z are possible.

Configuration 1:
Let's say z is a square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).
From y NE z, y must be to the northeast of z. Let's say y is a square with corners at (2,2), (3,2), (2,3), and (3,3).
From x B y, x must be inside the bounding box of y. Let's say x is a smaller square inside y with corners at (2.2,2.2), (2.8,2.2), (2.2,2.8), and (2.8,2.8).

In this configuration, x is to the northeast of z, so x NE z.

Configuration 2:
Let's keep z as before, a square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).
From y NE z, y must be to the northeast of z. Let's now make y a larger square with corners at (2,2), (6,2), (2,6), and (6,6).
From x B y, x must be inside the bounding box of y. Let's say x is a square inside y but more towards the northwest corner of y with corners at (2.5,4), (3.5,4), (2.5,5), and (3.5,5).

In this configuration, x is to the north of z and a bit to the east, but not directly to the north-east. So, it's to the north-east of z, or x NE z.

Configuration 3:
Let's keep z as before, a square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).
From y NE z, y must be to the northeast of z. Let's make y a square with corners at (2,2), (6,2), (2,3), and (6,3).
From x B y, x must be inside the bounding box of y. Let's say x is a square inside y but more towards the eastern edge of y with corners at (5,2.2), (5.5,2.2), (5,2.8), and (5.5,2.8).

In this configuration, x is to the northeast of z, so x NE z.

Hmm, it seems that in all configurations I've considered, x is to the northeast of z. Let's try to check if there's a configuration where x and z have a different relationship.

Let's try to expand the constraints and see if x can be to the north, east, or in the bounding box of z.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we know is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

Let's think about the constraints we already have and see if they're compatible with the conditions for x N z.

We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x). This means that z is entirely to the left of x. But for x N z, we need supx(x) <= supx(z), which means x should be narrower than z. These two constraints are contradictory unless supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x), which is a special case where x is just a vertical line at the rightmost edge of z. That's not a region in the way we've defined it. So, generally, x cannot be to the N of z.

Next, let's check for x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we know is true)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraint supy(z) <= infy(x), z is entirely below x. But for x E z, we need supy(x) <= supy(z), which means x should be shorter than z. These two constraints are contradictory, so x cannot be to the E of z.

Finally, let's check for x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our established constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the conditions for x B z. So, x cannot be inside the bounding box of z.

Actually, let's step back and check all of our constraints again. We know:
1. From x B y:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. From y NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)

From (1) and (2), we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x)

Looking at the definition of cardinal directions:
- a B b iff infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a S b iff supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SW b iff supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a W b iff supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a NW b iff supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a N b iff supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a NE b iff supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a E b iff supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a SE b iff supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we know is true)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we know is true)

These are exactly the two constraints we've established, so x NE z is definitely true.

If I go through the other cardinal directions, I find:
- For x B z, we have constraints that contradict our established constraints.
- For x S z, supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our established constraint supy(z) <= infy(x).
- For x SW z, both supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z) contradict our established constraints.
- For x W z, supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts our established constraint supx(z) <= infx(x).
- For x NW z, supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts our established constraint supx(z) <= infx(x).
- For x N z, supx(x) <= supx(z) constrains x to be narrower than z, which isn't generally consistent with our established constraint supx(z) <= infx(x).
- For x E z, supy(x) <= supy(z) constrains x to be shorter than z, which isn't generally consistent with our established constraint supy(z) <= infy(x).
- For x SE z, supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our established constraint supy(z) <= infy(x).

It's clear from our derived constraints that x must be to the northeast of z, i.e., x NE z. 

Actually, I should double-check, could it be exactly N or E too?

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we know is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The problem here is that our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) implies x is to the right of z, whereas for x N z, x should be directly above z (not to its right). So, x cannot be to the N of z.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we know is true)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The problem here is that our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) implies x is above z, whereas for x E z, x should be directly to the right of z (not above it). So, x cannot be to the E of z.

So, the only cardinal direction that's consistent with our derived constraints is NE.

Actually, let me triple check the logic by reasoning using specific regions. 

Let's place z at the origin with coordinates (0, 0) to (1, 1). For y to be in the NE of z, it must be to the right and above z. Let's say y is positioned at (2, 2) to (3, 3). 

Now, for x to be in the bounding box of y, it must be within the confines of y. Let's say x is a slightly smaller region within y, with coordinates (2.1, 2.1) to (2.9, 2.9).

Given these positions:
- supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 2.1, so x is to the right of z.
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2.1, so x is above z.

Based on these, x is to the northeast of z, confirming our logical derivation.

Actually, is that right? What about N:E? Let's check if x can be both N of z and E of z simultaneously.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we know is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we know is true)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The issue here is that for x N z, we need supx(x) <= supx(z), and for x E z, we need supy(x) <= supy(z). But these contradict our derived constraints supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), which imply x is to the right of z and above z.

So, x cannot be both N of z and E of z simultaneously, nor can it be N:E of z.

Actually, let me recheck my logic. I should also check if x can be in multiple cardinal directions at once w.r.t. z.

Let me reason through this again. We derived:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

For x to be NE of z, both conditions must be true, and they are. 

If x occupies the NE and N tile, for instance, it must span both regions. But if x spans both N and NE, then part of x must be at the same longitude as z, which contradicts our first constraint supx(z) <= infx(x).

Similarly, if x spans both NE and E, then part of x must be at the same latitude as z, which contradicts our second constraint supy(z) <= infy(x).

So, x must be solely in the NE direction of z.

Actually, wait. Let me take a different approach. 

We know:
1. From x B y:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. From y NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we have derived:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

Now, let's consider this differently. Constraint #1 is:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)

This means the leftmost edge of x is to the right of or at the same location as the leftmost edge of y.

Constraint #2 is:
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

The rightmost edge of x is to the left of or at the same location as the rightmost edge of y.

Constraint #3 is:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)

The bottommost edge of x is above or at the same location as the bottommost edge of y.

Constraint #4 is:
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

The topmost edge of x is below or at the same location as the topmost edge of y.

Now, from constraint #5:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)

The rightmost edge of z is to the left of the leftmost edge of y.

And from constraint #6:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

The topmost edge of z is below the bottommost edge of y.

From all of these constraints, it becomes clear that region x is to the right and above region z. This means x is in the NE direction of z.

Could there be any other relations? Let's check.

Given that supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z), the only relation that this strictly satisfies is NE.

However, I wonder if x could be in multiple cardinal direction tiles w.r.t. z.

Let's reason through this again. We have:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

These constraints place x entirely to the northeast of z, so the relation between x and z is x NE z.

Let me double check by looking at specific cases:

Case 1: What if x is a point? If x is a single point, given our constraints, x would be in the NE tile of z. So, the relation would be x NE z.

Case 2: What if x is a small square (a small region)? Given our constraints, x would be a small square in the NE tile of z. The relation would still be x NE z.

Case 3: What if x is a larger region spanning multiple tiles w.r.t. z? Let's think about this. Given our constraints, x must be to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)) and above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)). This places x entirely to the northeast of z. So, even if x is a large region, it would still be contained entirely in the NE tile of z. The relation would be x NE z.

I'm not sure if a cardinal relation in the form multiple tiles like "NE:N" is actually part of the model, since the task description only mentioned nine different tiles: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B. Let's assume that the answer should be one (or more) of these and not a combination like "NE:N".

Given the constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

These constraints define the NE tile w.r.t. z, and x is entirely within this tile. So, the relation between x and z is x NE z.

Actually, wait. The task provides us with the definition of a cardinal direction relation, which actually does allow for relations across multiple tiles:
A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied:
i) 1 <= k <= 9,
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE},
iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j,
iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

So, let me analyze each of the nine directions and check if it's logically possible for x to be in multiple directions w.r.t. z.

From our derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

1. B: x B z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is strictly to the right of z. This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) for B. So, x cannot be B of z.

2. S: x S z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for S. So, x cannot be S of z.

3. SW: x SW z if supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for SW. So, x cannot be SW of z.

4. W: x W z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for W. So, x cannot be W of z.

5. NW: x NW z if supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for NW. So, x cannot be NW of z.

6. N: x N z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which aligns with the first condition for N. However, we also know supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for N. So, x cannot be N of z.

7. NE: x NE z if supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
   From our constraints, both conditions for NE are satisfied. So, x can be NE of z.

8. E: x E z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x) and we also know supy(z) <= infy(x). The latter means z is below x. But for x E z, we need supy(x) <= supy(z), which means x should be shorter than z. These two are contradictory unless supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x), which is a special case. Generally, x cannot be E of z.

9. SE: x SE z if supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
   From our constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which aligns with the first condition for SE. However, we also know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for SE. So, x cannot be SE of z.

Based on our analysis, it's only logically possible for x to be NE of z. The information given doesn't allow for x to be in multiple cardinal directions simultaneously w.r.t. z.

Actually, I think I've been thinking entirely in terms of the "strict" or "single-tile" constraints. The task defines a cardinal direction relation more generally to allow regions to occupy multiple tiles. But I was verifying the constraints for each individual single-tile relation.

A region can span multiple tiles, and given the constraints, region x can be in the directions NE, N, or E, or a combination of these, w.r.t. z.

Wait, let's analyze this again. The constraints we've derived are:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

Let's consider all possible cardinal directions and check which ones are consistent with these constraints:

1. B: x B z requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (among other conditions). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts these. So, x cannot be B of z.

2. S: x S z requires supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the condition for S. So, x cannot be S of z.

3. SW: x SW z requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we've established that both of these are contradicted by our constraints. So, x cannot be SW of z.

4. W: x W z requires supx(x) <= infx(z). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts this. So, x cannot be W of z.

5. NW: x NW z requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The second condition is met by our constraints, but the first isn't. So, x cannot be NW of z.

6. N: x N z requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The first two conditions can be satisfied by our constraints (noting that supx(z) <= infx(x) doesn't contradict infx(z) <= infx(x)), but the third condition contradicts our first derived constraint (as I just noted it). So, x cannot be N of z.

7. NE: x NE z requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both conditions are met by our constraints. So, x can be NE of z.

8. E: x E z requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two conditions can be satisfied by our constraints, but the third condition isn't guaranteed. Actually, from supy(z) <= infy(x), we know that z is below x, but for x E z, x needs to be at the same height or shorter than z, which contradicts our second derived constraint. So, x cannot be E of z.

9. SE: x SE z requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition is met by our constraints, but the second isn't (for the same reason as with S). So, x cannot be SE of z.

From this analysis, it appears that only the NE direction is consistent with our derived constraints. It means that region x can only be in the NE tile relative to region z.

Given our derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

These constraints define the northeast (NE) region relative to z. If a region satisfies both of these constraints, it means it's entirely to the northeast of z. And from our analysis, region x satisfies both, so it must be in the NE direction of z.

Actually, I can see I made a mistake. Let's be much more careful about the constraints.

Recall that:
1. From x B y:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. From y NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, I can only infer the following:
- From supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), I get supx(z) <= infx(x).
- From supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), I get supy(z) <= infy(x).

We only have these two pieces of information. Let's use them to determine the range of possible relations.

If a region satisfies supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), it could be entirely to the northeast of z, or it could occupy multiple tiles. 

I've been forgetting that since we only know the constraints placed on infx(x) and infy(x) and not on supx(x) and supy(x), region x could extend in various ways. For example, it could extend downward to be at the same level as z, or it could extend leftward to be at the same longitude as z.

Given the constraints, x can be in any of the following directions (or combinations of them) relative to z:

1. NE: This is straightforwardly satisfied.
2. N: For x to also extend into the N tile, part of x should be directly above z. This requires infx(z) <= infx(x) or supx(x) <= supx(z), which isn't guaranteed by our constraints. But, if I imagine a specific configuration where x is partly directly above z, I don't see a contradiction with our constraints. So, x could potentially be in the N direction relative to z.
3. E: For x to also extend into the E tile, part of x should be directly to the right of z. This requires infy(z) <= infy(x) or supy(x) <= supy(z), which isn't guaranteed. But, again, I don't see a direct contradiction with our constraints, so x could potentially be in the E direction relative to z.
4. B: For x to also extend into the B tile, part of x should be inside the bounding box of z. This would require x to overlap with z, which would violate our constraints because x needs to be to the right and above z. So, x cannot be in the B direction relative to z.
5. SE, S, SW, W, NW: These directions all require x to at the very least be below z, to the left of z, and so on. Our constraints place x to the right and above z, which means x cannot be exclusively in these directions. I initially thought x could overlap with these tiles, but given the nature of spatial objects, that would contradict our constraints.

So, x can be in the NE direction of z for sure, and possibly in the N, E, or some combination of them.

OK, after sorting through the confusion, let me work through this methodically.

Given:
- Region x is B (bounding box) of region y
- Region y is NE (North East) of region z

From these, we can derive:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

From (1), we can see that the entirety of region x is to the right of region z. This rules out directions B, W, NW, SW.

From (2), we can see that the entirety of region x is above region z. This rules out directions B, S, SE, SW.

Combining both, we are left with NE, N, E, and NW. But from (1), we've ruled out NW. So, the possible directions for x relative to z are NE, N, and E.

However, let's check if N is really possible. For x to be in direction N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we know is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which is compatible with our derived constraints)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which means x is narrower than z)

But our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) means that x is entirely to the right of z. This contradicts the third condition for N, which requires x to be narrower than z and directly above it. So, x cannot be in the N direction of z.

Similarly, let's check if E is possible. For x to be in direction E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we know is true)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which is compatible with our derived constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which means x is shorter than z)

But our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) means that x is entirely above z. This contradicts the third condition for E, which requires x to be shorter than z and directly to its right. So, x cannot be in the E direction of z.

So, from our derived constraints, the only possible direction for x relative to z is NE.

Actually the original question was "If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?". So, I do need to check all possibilities.

Let's verify my logic for N and E.

For N:
The conditions for x N z are:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of z)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z)

Condition 1 is satisfied by our derived constraints.
Condition 2 may or may not be satisfied; our derived constraints don't restrict infx(x) in relation to infx(z).
Condition 3 contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which means supx(z) <= supx(x), contradicting the condition supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, x cannot be in the N direction of z.

For E:
The conditions for x E z are:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or at the same position as the bottom edge of z)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or at the same position as the top edge of z)

Condition 1 is satisfied by our derived constraints.
Condition 2 may or may not be satisfied; our derived constraints don't restrict infy(x) in relation to infy(z).
Condition 3 contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which means supy(z) <= supy(x), contradicting the condition supy(x) <= supy(z).

So, x cannot be in the E direction of z.

In summary, based on the constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

The only possible direction for x relative to z is NE.

Actually, let's be extra sure.

Using the definitions from the problem:

- a B b iff infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a S b iff supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SW b iff supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a W b iff supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a NW b iff supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a N b iff supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a NE b iff supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a E b iff supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a SE b iff supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (doesn't contradict our derived constraints)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x))
So, x cannot be B of z.

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x))
So, x cannot be S of z.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x))
So, x cannot be SW of z.

For x W z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x))
So, x cannot be W of z.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x))
So, x cannot be NW of z.

For x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (in line with our derived constraint)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (doesn't contradict our derived constraints)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x))
So, x cannot be N of z.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (in line with our derived constraint)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (in line with our derived constraint)
So, x can be NE of z.

For x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (in line with our derived constraint)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (doesn't contradict our derived constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x))
So, x cannot be E of z.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (in line with our derived constraint)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x))
So, x cannot be SE of z.

Based on this analysis, the only possible direction for x relative to z is NE.

Great, so our answer is that the possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

ANSWER:

The question asks for possible relations between region x and region z given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Let me analyze this systematically by deriving constraints from the given information.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This means:
1. x is strictly to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
2. x is strictly above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

Let's check each possible cardinal direction:
- For B, N, S, W, NW, SW: These require x to at least partially overlap with z horizontally or vertically, which contradicts our derived constraints.
- For E: Requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts our constraint that x is strictly above z.
- For SE: Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts our constraint that x is strictly above z.

The only relation that satisfies both constraints is NE.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is: NE
