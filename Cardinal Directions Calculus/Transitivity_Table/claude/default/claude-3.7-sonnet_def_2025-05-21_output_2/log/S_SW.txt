PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's figure out the possible spatial relations between region x and region z given that:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

Let me use the definitions provided to understand the constraints:

Given that x is S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

Given that y is SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) 
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now let's try to determine the possible relations between x and z:

From x being S of y, we know that x is below y.
From y being SW of z, we know that y is to the left and below z.

So, x is below y, and y is to the left and below z.

This means:
1. In terms of y-coordinates: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   - This implies supy(x) ≤ infy(z), meaning x is below z in the y-direction.

2. In terms of x-coordinates: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - This implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is to the left of z in the x-direction.

Therefore, x is below and to the left of z. This corresponds to the SW (Southwest) relationship.

However, let's be more careful. The facts above give us:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

Based on the definitions, this would mean x is SW of z.

But wait, I need to be even more careful. Let's see all possible positions of x relative to y and y relative to z, given the constraints.

For x S y:
- x is directly below y
- The x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y

For y SW z:
- y is to the left and below z
- The right edge of y is to the left of the left edge of z
- The top edge of y is below the bottom edge of z

Given these, let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. If the x-projection of x is fully within the x-projection of y, then x is to the left of z (because y is to the left of z).
2. If the y-projection (vertical) of x extends below y, it's still below z (because y is below z).

This would suggest that x can be SW of z.

But if the x-projection of x extends to the right of the x-projection of y (but still within the constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(y)), then it might overlap with the x-projection of z if z extends far to the left.

Let's think through this more carefully:

From y being SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
This means that y is completely to the left and below z. The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z. The topmost point of y is below the bottommost point of z.

From x being S of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
This means that x is completely below y. The topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of y. Additionally, the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y.

Now, since supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is below z.

Since infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the left of z.

So, x is below and to the left of z, which means x is SW of z.

But wait, that's not the only possibility. Let's think about it from the perspective of the bounding boxes and the constraints on the infimums and supremums.

Let's denote:
- The x-coordinate range of region x as [x_left, x_right]
- The y-coordinate range of region x as [x_bottom, x_top]
- Similarly for regions y and z.

Given that x is S of y:
- x_top ≤ y_bottom
- y_left ≤ x_left and x_right ≤ y_right (x's x-range is contained within y's x-range)

Given that y is SW of z:
- y_right ≤ z_left (y is to the left of z)
- y_top ≤ z_bottom (y is below z)

From these, we can derive:
- x_top ≤ y_bottom ≤ z_bottom (x is below z)
- x_right ≤ y_right ≤ z_left (x is to the left of z)

So, x is below and to the left of z, which means x is SW of z.

Actually, I'm approaching this all wrong. We need to use the formal definitions provided in the question.

Given that x is S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal span is within y's horizontal span)

Given that y is SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, let's derive constraints for the relationship between x and z:

From the constraints above, we can deduce:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (using transitivity), which means x is below z.
- Since infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Given that x is below and to the left of z, we can say x is SW of z. But this is not the only possibility.

Let's think again. The constraint x being S of y means:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal span is within y's horizontal span)

And y being SW of z means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

If we compare with the definitions:
- For x to be S of z: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- For x to be SW of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- For x to be W of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our derived constraints, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This satisfies the definition for x to be SW of z.

But we don't have enough constraints to uniquely determine that x is SW of z. For instance, we don't know if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which would be needed for x to be S of z) or if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which would be needed for x to be W of z).

So, based on the given constraints, the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- SW (if neither infx(z) ≤ infx(x) nor infy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- S (if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) but not infy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- W (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) but not infx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- B (if both infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and additionally supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))

Actually, I'm not sure if B (bounding box) is possible with the given constraints. Let's check:

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our derived constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These two constraints contradict the conditions for x to be B of z. So, x cannot be B of z.

I need to review the other possibilities as well:

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our derived constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is satisfied but supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) for x to be S of z. So, x cannot be S of z.

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our derived constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is satisfied but supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x to be W of z. So, x cannot be W of z.

It seems I was correct originally, albeit for the wrong reason. The only possible relationship between x and z based on the given constraints is SW.

Actually, let me think through this more carefully based on the definitions provided. Let me make sure that I understand the directions and constraints correctly.

If region x is S of region y, then:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (the top of x is below the bottom of y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y)

If region y is SW of region z, then:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (the right edge of y is to the left of the left edge of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (the top edge of y is below the bottom edge of z)

Given these, we can say:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x's top is below z's bottom)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's left edge)

Now, looking at the definitions for the possible relationships:

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), we can't have infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x can't be S of z.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)

Both conditions are satisfied, so x can be SW of z.

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we can't have infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x can't be W of z.

Checking all the other directional relationships using the provided definitions, I find that x can only be SW of z given the constraints of x being S of y and y being SW of z.

Actually, there's one more thing to think about. We are talking about regions, not just points. Let's make sure we're thinking about this properly.

In the given context, a single-tile cardinal direction relation is defined in terms of the infimums and supremums of the projections of the regions onto the coordinate axes. This is a way to define the relationship between two regions in terms of their relative positions.

Let's validate my understanding of the definitions:

If region x is S of region y, then:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (the highest point in x is below the lowest point in y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y)

If region y is SW of region z, then:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (the rightmost point in y is to the left of the leftmost point in z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (the highest point in y is below the lowest point in z)

Given these, I can say:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (the highest point in x is below the lowest point in z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (the rightmost point in x is to the left of the leftmost point in z)

Looking at the cardinal direction B (bounding box):
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), it contradicts the requirement infx(z) ≤ infx(x). Similarly, since supy(x) ≤ infy(z), it contradicts the requirement infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

That seems like a systematic way to approach it. Let me verify for all the other cardinal directions:

For S (South):
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (Satisfied)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be S of z.

For SW (South West):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (Satisfied)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (Satisfied)

Both conditions are satisfied, so x can be SW of z.

For W (West):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (Satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be W of z.

For NW (North West):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (Satisfied)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

We don't have direct constraints on supy(z) and infy(x), but we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z). This doesn't give us enough information to determine the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

Actually, wait. Let's think about the constraints available to us.

From x being S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal span is within y's horizontal span)

From y being SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

If we think about the position of x relative to z, we know:
- x is below y and y is below z, so x is below z: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- x is to the left of z (derived from the constraints): supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

These two facts alone tell us that x is to the left and below z, which matches the definition of SW (South West).

But I need to consider if there are other possible relationships. 

Let's go through the definitions of N, NE, SE, E, and NW to see if any of them could be possible:

For N (North):
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

For NE (North East):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). And, as noted for N, the y-coordinate constraint is also contradicted. So, x cannot be NE of z.

For SE (South East):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be SE of z.

For E (East):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be E of z.

For NW (North West):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (Satisfied)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would contradict supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (unless infy(x) = infy(z) and supy(z) = infy(z), which is a very specific case). In a more general setting, where these exact equalities don't hold, x cannot be NW of z. Even in the edge case, it might be more accurate to say x is SW of z, as the y-alignment is ambiguous.

So, based on the given constraints and the definitions provided, it seems that the only consistent relation between x and z is SW (South West). The other cardinal directions either contradict the derivations from the given constraints or are inconsistent with the definitions.

Actually, I don't think I need to check for all of them. We know two constraints from the given information:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
2. supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

Checking these against the definitions, they align with the SW (South West) definition:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

The given constraints only directly give us information about the relationship in the SW dimension. We don't have direct constraints on the other dimensions. While we can derive some implications for the other dimensions, they are based on the given constraints.

Let me ensure I'm not missing any subtle details by analyzing the problem once more. 

1. If region x is S of region y, then:
   - The y-coordinate constraint: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
   - The x-coordinate constraint: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal span is within y's horizontal span)

2. If region y is SW of region z, then:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

These constraints align with the definition of SW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

However, I'm starting to think I've been overthinking this and jumping to conclusions. Maybe me looking at each individual definition and checking if the constraints align is simpler? Let's do that:

For B (bounding box):
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). And supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

For S (South):
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) would contradict infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be S of z.

For SW (South West):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)

Both conditions are satisfied, so x can be SW of z.

For W (West):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) would contradict infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be W of z.

For NW (North West):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but this doesn't give us direct information about the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) > infy(x), which would contradict the condition for NW. But it's also possible that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would satisfy the condition for NW. 

Actually, it's more accurate to consider the implications of supy(x) ≤ infy(z). If region x is below region z, then the highest point in x is below the lowest point in z. This implies that the highest point in z (supy(z)) is above the lowest point in z (infy(z)), which in turn is above the highest point in x (supy(x)). So, supy(z) > supy(x). Furthermore, since the lowest point in x (infy(x)) must be below or at the highest point in x (supy(x)), we can say infy(x) ≤ supy(x) < infy(z) ≤ supy(z).

But this still doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). It's possible that infy(x) < supy(z), but we can't conclude for sure that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

With that in mind, NW could potentially be a relationship between x and z, although it would require very specific arrangements of the regions. A more natural interpretation, given the constraints, would be that x is SW of z.

For N (North):
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) would contradict infx(z) ≤ infx(x). Also, as discussed before, we can't conclusively say that supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

For NE (North East):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which would contradict supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Also, as discussed for NW, it's unclear if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) holds. So, x cannot be NE of z.

For E (East):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) would contradict supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Also, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) would contradict infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be E of z.

For SE (South East):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)

From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) would contradict supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be SE of z.

So, SW is definitely possible, but I'm unsure if NW is also possible.

Let's revisit the north-west relationship. For x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied from our constraints)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The issue is with the second condition: supy(z) ≤ infy(x). From our given constraints, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z). If x is below z, then it's reasonable to infer that z is above x, which means supy(z) > infy(x). But, we don't have a direct constraint that confirms this.

Actually, let's consider the definition of a region in REG. It's homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which means it's closed, connected, and has a connected boundary. This implies that a region doesn't have any "holes."

If x is below z, then the highest point in x (supy(x)) is below the lowest point in z (infy(z)). For the north-west condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) to be satisfied, the lowest point in x (infy(x)) must be above the highest point in z (supy(z)). But if x is below z, this can't be the case. So, it seems NW is not possible.

Actually, it's not quite right that if x is below z, then z is above x. To be precise, the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) only tells us that the highest point in x is below the lowest point in z. It doesn't necessarily mean that every point in x is below every point in z.

Let me try a slightly different approach. Given that x is S of y, we can visualize x as being directly below y and within the horizontal confines of y. And given that y is SW of z, y is to the left and below z. Combining these, x is below y, which in turn is below z, so x is below z. Also, x is within the horizontal confines of y, which is to the left of z, so x is to the left of z.

This visualization aligns with the SW relation. To visualize NW, x would have to be to the left and above z. Since x is below y, which is below z, x is below z, which contradicts the "above" part of NW. So, it seems NW is not possible.

OK, I think we're getting lost in the weeds here. Let's go back to the definitions and approach this systematically.

Given that x is S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal span is within y's horizontal span)

Given that y is SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

When I compare these with the definitions of cardinal directions, the only one that satisfies both of these constraints is SW, which requires:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

Let's double-check the others. Let's start with N. For x to be north of z, N(z), we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's horizontal span is within z's horizontal span)

From our derived constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which tells us that x is below z. This contradicts the requirement for N that z is below x. So, x cannot be N of z.

For NE, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is to the left of x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x)

From our derived constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Also, as explained for N, the y-coordinate constraint is also contradicted. So, x cannot be NE of z.

For E, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is to the left of x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's vertical span is within z's vertical span)

From our derived constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be E of z.

Let me check B again (I think I established this earlier--x cannot be B of z--but let's double-check).

For B (bounding box), we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's horizontal span is within z's horizontal span)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's vertical span is within z's vertical span)

From our derived constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means the rightmost point in x is to the left of the leftmost point in z. This contradicts the requirement for B that x's horizontal span is within z's horizontal span. So, x cannot be B of z.

Let me also check the actual problem statement again. 

If region x is S of region y, and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

From the analysis I've done, the only relation that satisfies the constraints derived from the givens is SW (South West). So my final answer is SW.

Actually, let me pause and think of a counterexample as a way to double-check my work.

If x is S of y, meaning x is below y and its horizontal span is within y's horizontal span. And if y is SW of z, meaning y is to the left and below z. It's possible that x's horizontal span overlaps with z's horizontal span. In that case, x might not be strictly to the left of z, which would contradict the SW relationship.

But wait, is that really possible? Let's double check by going back to the derived constraints and the implications of the region being in REG.

Given that x is S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal span is within y's horizontal span)

Given that y is SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

This last constraint, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), means that the rightmost point in x is to the left of the leftmost point in z, which implies that x is indeed strictly to the left of z. Thus, there can't be any overlap between x's horizontal span and z's horizontal span. So, the SW relationship holds. I can't find a counterexample.

I think my process has been systematic, and the conclusion aligns with the given information and the defined cardinal directions. Hence, the possible relation between region x and region z, given that x is S of y and y is SW of z, is SW. 

But I've been saying "the possible relation", but maybe there are multiple relations? Let me go back to the problem statement: "which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?". The question is asking for the possible relations (potentially multiple). 

From the analysis I've done, SW (South West) is the only relation that satisfies the derived constraints. So, the answer to the question is: SW.

Actually hold on, I can think of a specific case that could possibly allow for another relation. Let's say x, y, and z are all points (which are a special case of regions). If y is single point, then x being S of y means x is directly below y. Similarly, if z is a single point and y is SW of z, then y is to the left and below z. In this specific arrangement, x is below y, which is below z, so x is below z. And x is at the same horizontal position as y, which is to the left of z, so x is to the left of z. This corresponds to the SW relation. So the only possible relation is SW.

So far, we've considered only the cardinal directions that define a unique relationship.

Let's dive a bit deeper into the problem. The cardinal direction relation is an expression R₁: ... : Rₖ, where R₁, ..., Rₖ belong to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. 

In the context of the question, region x is S of region y, which means x has a direct S relationship with y. Similarly, region y is SW of region z, which means y has a direct SW relationship with z. The question asks for the possible relations between x and z.

From our derived constraints, x is below and to the left of z. This is consistent with the SW direction. Given the constraints, there's no ambiguity here; the relationship between x and z is SW. No counterexample can be constructed from the given information, as supported by the proper definitions of the cardinal directions. The answer is SW.

OK, to summarize, let's analyze the possible relation between region x and region z, given that region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z.

The constraints from the given information are:
1. From x being S of y:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal span is within y's horizontal span)

2. From y being SW of z:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, I've derived two key constraints for the relationship between x and z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

Comparing these constraints with the definitions of the cardinal directions, the only direction that is consistent with both constraints is SW (South West), which requires:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

The other cardinal directions either contradict one or both of these constraints.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z, given the constraints, is exclusively SW.

Actually, I'm realizing that my derivation "supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)" from the constraints "infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)" and "supx(y) ≤ infx(z)" is too strong. From the constraint "supx(x) ≤ supx(y)", we can only say the rightmost point of x is not to the right of the rightmost point of y. And from the constraint "supx(y) ≤ infx(z)", the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z. Combining these, the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z, which does indeed imply "supx(x) ≤ infx(z)".

But I stand by my conclusion. The possible relation between region x and region z, given the constraints, is exclusively SW.

Actually, I'm overthinking this problem in a way. Let's step back and think about it more conceptually.

If x is S of y, it means x is below y. If y is SW of z, it means y is to the left and below z. 

So, x is below y, which is below z, which means x is below z. And x's horizontal extent is within y's, where y is to the left of z, which means x is to the left of z. 

This conceptual understanding aligns with the constraints we derived and our conclusion that x is SW of z.

Also, given that I've checked all the possible cardinal directions and verified that only SW satisfies the derived constraints, I'm confident in the answer. It's even more clear when we have a visual understanding of the problem. You can't have x to the right of z, and you can't have x above z. You can't even have x's horizontal extent overlapping with z's. Given these conditions, the only possible relation is SW.

So, the answer to the question "If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is SW (South West).

Let's make one final pass through the analysis. From the given constraints, "x is S of y" and "y is SW of z".

1. "x is S of y" means x is directly below y with its horizontal extent contained within y's.
2. "y is SW of z" means y is to the left and below z with no horizontal or vertical overlap.

From these:
- Since x is below y, and y is below z, x must be below z (transitivity of the "below" relation). So the first component of the direction is S.
- The horizontal (x-coordinate) relationship is a bit more nuanced. Since x's horizontal extent is contained within y's and y is to the left of z, x is to the left of z. So the second component of the direction is W.

Combining, the only possible relation between x and z is SW (South West).

I've been careful, and I've approached the problem from multiple angles, and the consistent conclusion is SW. So, the answer to the question is: SW.

Actually, I think I have a simpler approach. Let's use it as a way to check our work.

Imagine a coordinate system with the positive y-axis pointing upward and the positive x-axis pointing to the right. If x is S of y, then x is directly below y. This places x at a smaller y-coordinate than y. If y is SW of z, then y is to the left and below z. This places y at a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z.

Given these, we can infer that x is at a smaller y-coordinate than z (because x is at a smaller y-coordinate than y, and y is at a smaller y-coordinate than z). Also, x is at a smaller x-coordinate than z (because x's horizontal extent is contained within y's, and y is at a smaller x-coordinate than z). 

So, x is to the left and below z, which corresponds to the SW relation. Hence, the answer to the question is: SW.

I've approached the problem from various angles, and the consistent conclusion is that the possible relation between region x and region z, given the constraints, is exclusively SW (South West). Therefore, the final answer is: SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions, I'll analyze the possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From x being S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal span is within y's horizontal span)

From y being SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

Checking these against all cardinal direction definitions:
- For SW: requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which are both satisfied

Other relations either contradict the horizontal constraint (S, SE, B, NE, E) or the vertical constraint (W, NW, N).

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: SW
