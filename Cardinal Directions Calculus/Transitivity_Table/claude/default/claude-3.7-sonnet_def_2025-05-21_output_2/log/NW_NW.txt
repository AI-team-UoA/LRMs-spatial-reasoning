PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

Given information:
- Region x is NW of region y, which means x NW y
- Region y is NW of region z, which means y NW z

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

According to the definitions provided:
- x NW y means that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NW z means that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's think about what this means in terms of the relative positions:

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) [x is to the west of y]
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) [y is to the west of z]

This implies that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So region x is definitely to the west of region z.

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) [x is to the north of y]
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) [y is to the north of z]

This implies that supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So region x is definitely to the north of region z.

Now, based on our findings:
- Region x is to the west of region z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z))
- Region x is to the north of region z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

So the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

Actually, let me double check my work. 

Given information:
- x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

For the x-coordinate:
From x NW y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
From y NW z, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

By transitivity, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
This means region x is to the west of region z.

For the y-coordinate:
From x NW y, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
From y NW z, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

By transitivity, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which implies supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
This means region x is to the north of region z.

Given that region x is to the west of region z and region x is to the north of region z, the relation between x and z is NW (North West).

So the relation between region x and region z is NW.

Actually, let me check a little bit more carefully:

When I say x NW y, that means:
- x is to the west of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))
- x is to the north of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))

And when y NW z, that means:
- y is to the west of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z))
- y is to the north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y))

Looking at the x-coordinate: 
- From x NW y, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y NW z, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Since we know that for any region r, infx(r) ≤ supx(r), we have:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is to the west of z.

Looking at the y-coordinate:
- From x NW y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y NW z, we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Again, since for any region r, infy(r) ≤ supy(r), we have:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x is to the north of z.

Now, based on the cardinal direction definitions provided:
- If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x NW z.

So, the relation between x and z is definitely NW.

But wait, I'm not thinking carefully about this. Let me re-examine.

Given:
- x NW y
- y NW z

Let's analyze the relative positions more carefully:

For x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y): x is to the west of y
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x): x is to the north of y

For y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z): y is to the west of z
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y): y is to the north of z

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to check the relative positions:

For the x-coordinate:
We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
By transitivity, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinate:
We know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
By transitivity, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

Given these constraints, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Hmm, but I don't think this is the full answer. Let me think more broadly about the possible relations.

If x NW y and y NW z, it's clear that x is to the northwest of z. However, the exact relation between x and z could be one of a few possibilities:

1. NW: As I've established, x could be to the northwest of z.
2. N: If x is directly north of z, then supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
3. W: If x is directly west of z, then supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Let me check:

For x to be in the N relation with z (directly north), we would need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've already established)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

But we've also established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the above condition. So, x cannot be directly north of z.

For x to be in the W relation with z (directly west), we would need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've already established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

But we've also established that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts the above condition. So, x cannot be directly west of z.

Hmm, let's think more broadly about the question. The problem asks for "possible" relations, which might mean there are certain configurations or relative positions of the regions that could lead to different relations.

Let's see.

Region x NW region y means:
- x is to the west of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))
- x is to the north of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))

Region y NW region z means:
- y is to the west of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z))
- y is to the north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y))

From these, we've deduced that:
- x is to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z))
- x is to the north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

Which makes x NW z.

I'm not immediately seeing any other possible cardinal direction relation between x and z, given the constraints. 

Perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go back to the definitions and see if there's another interpretation.

Actually, let's consider the nine single-tile cardinal direction relations: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE.

We know x NW y and y NW z.
From these, we've derived:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) [x is to the west of z]
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) [x is to the north of z]

These two conditions define the NW relation, which means x NW z.

But, there's also a possibility of composite cardinal direction relations, represented as R1:...:Rk. However, the constraints we've derived (x is to the west of z and x is to the north of z) make NW the only valid relation between x and z.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

Actually, I should verify I'm not missing anything. I'll re-analyze the constraints and see if there are any other possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- x NW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NW z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) [x is to the west of z]
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) [x is to the north of z]

Now, let's check the conditions for each of the nine single-tile cardinal direction relations to see if any of them (other than NW) could apply:

1. x B z (Bounding Box): This would mean infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But we've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be in the B relation with z.

2. x S z (South): This would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But we've already established that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x cannot be in the S relation with z.

3. x SW z (South West): This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which satisfies the first condition. But we've also established that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x cannot be in the SW relation with z.

4. x W z (West): This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which satisfies the first condition. But we've also established that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be in the W relation with z.

5. x NW z (North West): This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We've already established both of these conditions. So, x can be in the NW relation with z.

6. x N z (North): This would mean supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We've already established that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which satisfies the first condition. But we've also established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be in the N relation with z.

7. x NE z (North East): This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We've already established that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which satisfies the second condition. But we've also established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be in the NE relation with z.

8. x E z (East): This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be in the E relation with z.

9. x SE z (South East): This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be in the SE relation with z.

It seems that, given the constraints, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, let me look at the problem statement again to see if I'm missing something.

The problem asks: "If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

Given the analysis above, it seems that the only possible relation between x and z is NW. But I feel like I might be missing a different interpretation or perspective.

Actually, let's go back to the definition. At the beginning, the description states "A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk."

- For k=1, the relation is a single-tile cardinal direction (like NW).
- For 1 < k ≤ 9, the relation indicates that the region is distributed across multiple directions (e.g., N:NE, or B:NW:N).

Given the constraints, we know that the region x is to the west of z and to the north of z, which at least makes a part of x in the NW direction of z. But, it's possible that x spans multiple cardinal directions relative to z. In such a case, the relation wouldn't be just NW, but could be a composite relation, for example, NW:N, NW:W, or NW:N:W.

But we've already analyzed and confirmed that x cannot be in the N, W, or any other single-tile cardinal direction relative to z, except NW. So, even if we consider composite relations, NW remains the only valid direction, and thus NW is the only valid composite relation as well.

Let's re-examine the problem to see if there's any loose interpretation or edge case I'm missing. I want to be sure I'm not overlooking any possibility.

Actually, I think I've been too restrictive in my interpretation. The problem statement gave us conditions for single-tile cardinal directions, but there could be configurations where x is distributed across multiple directions relative to z.

For instance, based on the conditions for x NW y and y NW z, we know that x is to the west of z and to the north of z. This guarantees that at least a part of x is in the NW direction of z. But, it's still possible for x to extend beyond just the NW direction, spanning multiple cardinal directions relative to z.

Let me analyze the constraints a bit more openly:

From x NW y and y NW z, we've derived:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) [x is to the west of z]
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) [x is to the north of z]

These constraints ensure that the region x is entirely to the west of z and entirely to the north of z. But, this doesn't mean that x is confined to the NW tile relative to z. It could span the NW tile and potentially the N tile, the W tile, or both.

Let's reconsider the conditions for the N, W, and NW relations:

- N: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- W: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- NW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our derived constraints, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means that x is at least in the NW direction of z. But, could it also be in the N or W directions?

For x to be in the N direction, we'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The third condition we already know is true, but the first two contradict our derived constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x can't be in the N direction.

For x to be in the W direction, we'd need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The first condition we already know is true, but the third contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x can't be in the W direction either.

Looking back at the problem:

It doesn't say "if region x is in the NW tile of region y", but "if region x is NW of region y". This is a bit ambiguous. It could mean:
1. x is strictly in the NW tile of y.
2. x is in the NW direction relative to y, but might span multiple cardinal direction tiles.

If we interpret the problem statement using the first interpretation, then the only possible relation between x and z is NW. But, if we use the second interpretation, we might have to consider other possibilities.

Hmm, actually, let me look more carefully at the original problem formulation again.

Actually, looking at the problem statement more carefully, I noticed that there's a distinction between "region x is NW of region y" and the formal definition of the "NW" relation. The formal definition of the "NW" relation gives us:

a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)

So, when the problem says "region x is NW of region y", I believe it's using this formal definition. That is, it's saying:

supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

And when it says "region y is NW of region z", it's saying:

supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these two conditions, I've derived:

supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Which is precisely the formal definition of the "NW" relation applied to x and z. That is, x NW z.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

Actually, I need to remember that the statement "region x is NW of region y" might mean that there is a non-empty part of x which is in the NW tile of y, not necessarily the whole of x. It depends on which system of cardinal directions the question is using. Let's double-check the definition given in the problem.

According to the definitions provided:

The question says "region x is NW of region y" and "region y is NW of region z", which I believe means "x NW y" and "y NW z" using the formal definition of the "NW" relation.

From the text, the relation "a NW b" is defined by:
supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)

Given "x NW y" and "y NW z", we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) [x is to the west of z]
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) [x is to the north of z]

This meets the condition for "x NW z".

There are no other constraints on the regions x, y, and z other than the fact that they belong to the set REG, which are regions homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. Since there are no additional constraints, and we've derived that "x NW z", this is the only possible relation between x and z.

Actually, this is the answer: The possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

Ah wait. I want one more check. Let me look at the definition of the cardinal direction relation again. 

The standard definition is that A is north of B if A fully lies above B, that A is west of B if A fully lies to the west of B, etc. Since a region can be decomposed to 9 parts (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B), a region can have a combination of directions. So a relation C is said to be from A to B if there are parts of A that are C of B, for those 9 parts. 

In the problem statement, it says "A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

This statement does confirm that a cardinal direction relation can be composed of multiple such relations. 

But the problem statement also provides the formal definition of a "NW" relation for regions a and b:
a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)

From this, it's clear that if "a NW b", then the entire region a is to the northwest of b, not just a part of it. Given this, when the problem states "region x is NW of region y", it means x NW y using the formal definition, and similarly for "region y is NW of region z".

Given "x NW y" and "y NW z", we've already derived that x NW z.

So the relation between region x and region z is NW.

Actually, I need to be more precise. Let me refer to the definition of the nine single-tile cardinal direction relations given in the problem statement:

- B (Bounding Box): a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- S (South): a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- SW (South West): a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- W (West): a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- NW (North West): a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- N (North): a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- NE (North East): a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- E (East): a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- SE (South East): a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

From the definition of the NW relation, we have:
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

We can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies supy(z) <= infy(x)

These two conditions (supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)) match the definition of the NW relation for x and z. Therefore, x NW z.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

Hmm, I still don't feel fully confident in my answer. Let's carefully re-examine the problem.

The problem asks for the "possible relations" between x and z, which suggests there might be more than one.

From the given constraints:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

We've derived:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

This gives us that x NW z.

But, let's think about the problem from a slightly different angle. The constraints we've derived only tell us that region x is to the west of z and to the north of z. It doesn't tell us anything else about the shapes or the specific positions of these regions.

For instance, region x could be very large, extending in all directions while still maintaining that it's to the west of z and to the north of z. In such a case, parts of x might overlap with other cardinal direction tiles relative to z.

Let's check:

From the derived constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This means the entirety of region x is to the west of region z.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This means the entirety of region z is to the south of region x.

Given these two constraints, region x is in the northwest direction of region z. For the entire region x to be in a different cardinal direction, it would need to violate one of these constraints, which it can't because we derived these constraints from the given conditions.

But, could region x be in a composite cardinal direction, spanning multiple tiles relative to z?

Let's check which of the tiles relative to z can region x overlap with:

1. x can't overlap with the "B" tile of z because it's entirely to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)).
2. x can't overlap with the "S" tile of z because z is entirely to the south of x (supy(z) <= infy(x)).
3. x can't overlap with the "SW" tile of z because z is entirely to the south of x (supy(z) <= infy(x)).
4. x can't overlap with the "W" tile of z because it might have parts that are not to the north of z; but wait, we know z is entirely to the south of x (supy(z) <= infy(x)). But, this is the definition of x NW z. So, if x overlaps with the "W" tile of z, then parts of x are not in the NW direction of z, which contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x).
5. x can overlap with the "NW" tile of z because it's to the northwest of z.
6. x can't overlap with the "N" tile of z because it's entirely to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)).
7. x can't overlap with the "NE" tile of z because it's entirely to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)).
8. x can't overlap with the "E" tile of z because it's entirely to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)).
9. x can't overlap with the "SE" tile of z because it's entirely to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) and z is entirely to the south of x (supy(z) <= infy(x)).

So, based on the derived constraints, region x can only overlap with the "NW" tile of z. Thus, the relation between region x and region z is NW and nothing else.

Actually, sorry for being confused. Let's do it this way:

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) [from x NW y]
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [from y NW z]

By transitivity, supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x is entirely to the west of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [from x NW y]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [from y NW z]

By transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(x). So, z is entirely to the south of x, or in other words, x is entirely to the north of z.

Given these derived constraints, x can only be in the NW relation with z. No other cardinal direction relation is consistent with these constraints.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is "NW".

Actually, I just realized I made a categorical error. In the context of cardinal directions, saying "region x is NW of region y" does not mean the same thing as "x NW y". 

Let's try to reason through this problem in a different way.

Let's revisit the 9-tile model of cardinal directions. Imagine placing a 3x3 grid centered around region z. This grid divides the space into 9 tiles: NW, N, NE, W, B (Bounding Box), E, SW, S, SE. 

Now, for every position of x in this space, there's a corresponding cardinal direction relation between x and z. For instance, if x is entirely within the NW tile of this grid, then the relation is x NW z.

Given the constraints:
- x NW y: x is in the NW tile of a grid centered around y.
- y NW z: y is in the NW tile of a grid centered around z.

Now, let's think about where x could be relative to z, given these constraints.

Since y is in the NW tile of z, y is to the northwest of z. And since x is in the NW tile of y, x is to the northwest of y.

The question is, what are the possible relations between x and z?

From our derived constraints:
- Region x is entirely to the west of region z.
- Region x is entirely to the north of region z.

Given these, the only possible relation is that x is in the NW tile of the grid centered around z, which means the relation is x NW z.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is "NW".

I think we're on the right track. Let's just make sure we're clear on the notation. The problem asks for "possible relations" between x and z, which I believe refers to the card direction relations (like NW, N, etc.). But I want to make sure to not overambiguous anything. I'll carefully read the description again.

Actually, I noticed that we're given a precise definition of cardinal direction relations. It says:

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

This means a cardinal direction relation can be a single direction (like "NW") or a composite of multiple directions (like "NW:N" or "NW:W:N").

So, our question becomes: For all the possible locations of regions x, y, and z such that x NW y and y NW z, what are the possible cardinal direction relations that can exist between x and z?

Let's revisit our derived constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): Region x is entirely to the west of region z.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): Region z is entirely to the south of region x.

Given these constraints, region x can only lie in the "NW" tile relative to region z. It cannot span multiple tiles.

Let's double-check this by checking the conditions for each of the nine tiles again:

1. B (Bounding Box): This would require infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the requirement that infx(z) <= infx(x).

2. S (South): This would require supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement that supy(x) <= infy(z).

3. SW (South West): This would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition is consistent with our derived constraint, but the second contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x).

4. W (West): This would require supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first and second conditions are consistent with our derived constraints, but there's no guarantee for the third. In fact, if supy(x) > supy(z), it wouldn't satisfy this condition. So, region x doesn't necessarily lie in the "W" tile relative to region z.

Actually, let me fix the condition for W. W is defined as "a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)". So W would require supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supx(x) <= infx(z). We've derived supy(z) <= infy(x), which is stronger than infy(z) <= infy(x). But we know nothing about the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z), so x doesn't necessarily lie in the "W" tile relative to region z.

5. NW (North West): This would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these conditions are consistent with our derived constraints. So, region x could lie in the "NW" tile relative to region z.

6. N (North): This would require supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The first condition is consistent with our derived constraints, but the second contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).

7. NE (North East): This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The second condition is consistent with our derived constraints, but the first contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).

8. E (East): This would require supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The second condition is consistent with our derived constraints, but the first contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).

9. SE (South East): This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both of these conditions contradict our derived constraints.

So, based on the constraints we've derived, region x can only lie in the "NW" tile relative to region z.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is "NW".

Still something feels wrong. Let's really understand the definition a little more closely.

The definition of "a NW b" is given as:
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

This means for "a NW b" to be true, region a must be entirely to the west of region b, and region a must be entirely to the north of region b.

Given:
- x NW y: Region x is entirely to the west of region y, and entirely to the north of region y.
- y NW z: Region y is entirely to the west of region z, and entirely to the north of region z.

Using transitivity, we've derived:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): Region x is entirely to the west of region z.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): Region x is entirely to the north of region z.

These two conditions define the "NW" relation. So, x NW z.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is "NW".

Actually, I keep re-reading the problem and I don't think there are any other possible interpretations or derived conclusions beyond x NW z. The conditions for a region a to be in relation R with region b are clearly defined, and based on the given information, the only possible relation between x and z is NW. So when the queston asks "which could be the possible relations", the answer is: "NW" and only "NW".

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is:

NW

Here's the reasoning:

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

For the x-coordinate:
- From x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- By transitivity: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

For the y-coordinate:
- From x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y NW z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- By transitivity: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Therefore: supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) match exactly the definition of NW relation. This means region x is entirely to the west of region z and entirely to the north of region z.
