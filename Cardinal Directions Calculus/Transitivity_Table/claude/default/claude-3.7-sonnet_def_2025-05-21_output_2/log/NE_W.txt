PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step about this problem.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y, denoted as x NE y
- Region y is W of region z, denoted as y W z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions:

1. x NE y means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of y)

2. y W z means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the west of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y is horizontally aligned with z)

Now, let's try to determine the relation between x and z using transitivity and the constraints above.

From x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these, we can say:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)  (from x NE y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (from y W z)

This doesn't give us a direct constraint between x and z in the east-west direction, because we don't know how infx(x) relates to infx(z).

Now for the north-south direction:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (from x NE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)  (from y W z)

Combining these:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) implies infy(z) <= infy(x)

However, we don't know how supy(z) relates to infy(x), so we can't establish a clear north-south relation.

Let's visualize this:

For x NE y:
```
    x
      
y
```

For y W z:
```
y   z
```

So, combined, we have something like:
```
    x
      
y   z
```

From this visualization, it seems that x could be in various positions relative to z:
1. x could be NE of z
2. x could be N of z
3. x could be E of z
4. x could be SE of z
5. x could be B (bounding box) of z
6. x could be NW of z
7. x could be W of z
8. x could be SW of z

But, given the constraints, let's check which ones are actually possible:

1. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   We know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know how supy(z) compares to infy(x). So, for x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   We don't have a direct constraint on how infx(x) relates to supx(z), but given that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), which would make x NE of z.

2. x N z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   Similar to the above, if supx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), and if the bounding box of z in the east-west direction contains the bounding box of x, then x could be N of z.

3. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   Again, similar reasoning, it's possible for x to be E of z.

Let me stop here and reconsider this problem. I think I'm making it too complicated. Let's go back to the basic definitions and see what we can infer directly.

Given:
- x NE y
- y W z

Let's define the coordinates of x, y, and z. Let's assume the regions are simple points for simplicity first.

For x NE y:
- x has coordinates (x_x, x_y)
- y has coordinates (y_x, y_y)
- x_x > y_x (x is east of y)
- x_y > y_y (x is north of y)

For y W z:
- z has coordinates (z_x, z_y)
- y_x < z_x (y is west of z)
- y_y range overlaps with z_y range (y is horizontally aligned with z)

Now, combining these two:
- x_x > y_x (from x NE y)
- y_x < z_x (from y W z)
- x_y > y_y (from x NE y)
- y_y "overlaps" with z_y (from y W z)

From x_x > y_x and y_x < z_x, we can infer that x_x > y_x > z_x. Actually, no, that's not correct. We only know that x_x > y_x and y_x < z_x. This means that x_x can be greater than, equal to, or less than z_x.

From x_y > y_y and y_y "overlaps" with z_y, we can infer that x_y is greater than the lower bound of the y_y range of y. Since y_y "overlaps" with z_y, x_y could be greater than, equal to, or less than z_y.

Ok, I'm not making progress with this approach, since regions aren't just points and the overlapping makes things complex. Let's approach it differently.

Actually, I think I was initially on the right track. Let me use the bounding box representation and the constraints more carefully.

Given:
- x NE y means:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of y)
  - supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of y)

- y W z means:
  - supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the west of z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y is vertically aligned with z)

Let's try to deduce the possible relation between x and z by examining the constraints in both the x and y dimensions:

For the x-dimension:
- From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y W z, we have supx(y) <= infx(z)

But we don't have a direct constraint between infx(x) and infx(z). infx(x) can be less than, equal to, or greater than infx(z).

For the y-dimension:
- From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y W z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).

So, infy(z) <= infy(x), which means that z starts (in the y-direction) before or at the same point as x.

Now, let's visualize the possible positions of x relative to z based on these constraints:

(north-south direction) y-axis

```
     |
     |   x
     |
     |
z    |
     |
     |
     |
     +----------------
                    (east-west direction) x-axis
```

OK wait, let me re-examine this. We have:

From y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z). That is, y is strictly to the west of z.
From x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x). x is strictly to the northeast of y.

Also, from y W z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means that y is vertically aligned with z.

OK, I need to be even more precise. Let's use the definitions directly.

1. x NE y means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)

2. y W z means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Given these constraints, I'll determine what we know for sure about the relationship between x and z.

For the x-dimension:
- From x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z)

This tells us that both x and z are to the east of y, but it doesn't directly give us the relationship between x and z in the x-dimension.

For the y-dimension:
- From x NE y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x).

This means the northern boundary of z is below or at the same level as the southern boundary of x. In other words, z doesn't extend northward beyond the southern boundary of x.

Let me draw a diagram to visualize this:

```
    x
       
y   z
```

Now, based on this diagram and the constraints, what can we determine about the relation between x and z?

The possible relations are:
1. x NE z (x is northeast of z)
2. x N z (x is north of z)
3. x E z (x is east of z)
4. x B z (x is within the bounding box of z)
5. x NW z (x is northwest of z)
6. x W z (x is west of z)
7. x SW z (x is southwest of z)
8. x S z (x is south of z)
9. x SE z (x is southeast of z)

Let's check each one:

1. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   We already know infy(z) <= infy(x). If we also have supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is NE of z.

2. x N z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   If x's bounding box in the x-dimension is contained within z's bounding box in the x-dimension, and z doesn't extend northward beyond the southern boundary of x, then x is N of z.

3. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   If x is to the east of z and x's bounding box in the y-dimension is contained within z's bounding box in the y-dimension, then x is E of z.

But this is getting quite complex, and I think I might be overcomplicating it.

Let's approach this differently, using a more visual approach.

Given:
- x is NE of y
- y is W of z

This means:
- x is to the north and east of y
- y is to the west of z and vertically aligned with z

Let's place these on a grid:

```
    x
       
y   z
```

Ah, I see. Let me think step by step. I'll start by considering the initial constraints and then visualize the possible configurations.

From x NE y:
- x is to the northeast of y
- This means x is above and to the right of y

From y W z:
- y is to the west of z
- y and z overlap vertically

So, in a basic diagram:

```
    x?
      
y   z
```

Where "x?" is the general area where x can be.

Let's consider the constraints more precisely:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y and z overlap vertically)

Let's specifically examine the possible relations between x and z:

1. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of z)
   
   Given that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), i.e., x is to the east of z.
   
   Also, given that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x), i.e., x is to the north of z.
   
   So, it's possible for x to be NE of z.

2. x N z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x and z overlap horizontally)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of z)
   
   Given that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), it's possible for infx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   And, as with NE, it's possible for supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   So, it's possible for x to be N of z.

3. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (x and z overlap vertically)
   
   As with NE, it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   Also, given that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), it's possible for infy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   But, we don't have a direct constraint for supy(x) <= supy(z). So, it's unclear if x can be E of z.

Let's continue checking the remaining relations to see what's possible:

4. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)  (x is to the south of z)
   
   As before, it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   But, given that supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   So, x cannot be SE of z.

5. x S z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x and z overlap horizontally)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)  (x is to the south of z)
   
   Similarly, given the constraints, x cannot be S of z.

6. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)  (x is to the south of z)
   
   Given that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), it's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z), but it's also possible that supx(x) > infx(z).
   
   But, as above, x cannot be to the south of z.
   
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the west of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (x and z overlap vertically)
   
   As above, it's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z).
   
   Given that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   But, we don't have a direct constraint for supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   So, it's unclear if x can be W of z.

8. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of z)
   
   As above, it's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z).
   
   And, as with NE and N, it's possible for supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   So, it's possible for x to be NW of z.

9. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x is within the bounding box of z in the x-dimension)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (x is within the bounding box of z in the y-dimension)
   
   Given the constraints, it's possible for infx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   But, we don't have direct constraints for supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   So, it's unclear if x can be within the bounding box of z.

I think I'm being too meticulous here. Let's take a step back and simplify.

From the given constraints:
- x is NE of y
- y is W of z

Visually, we have:

```
    x?
      
y   z
```

Let's consider the relative positions of x and z:

- In the east-west direction, y is to the west of z. From the constraint on x, we know x is to the east of y. But this doesn't give us a direct constraint on the east-west relationship between x and z. x could be to the west, east, or directly above/below z.

- In the north-south direction, y and z can overlap vertically. From the constraint on x, we know x is to the north of y. This implies that x is to the north of at least part of z (specifically, the part that overlaps with y). But x could also extend southward or northward beyond z.

Given these considerations, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NE z
- x N z
- x NW z

But wait, let me really check every relation. Most constraints are composed of multiple atomic constraints, and I should check each one.

I'll enumerate all relations and see if they are consistent with the given constraints.

Given:
- x NE y
  - supx(y) <= infx(x)
  - supy(y) <= infy(x)

- y W z
  - supx(y) <= infx(z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

I'll proceed systematically:

1. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
   From y W z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z).
   
   These don't directly give us supy(z) <= infy(x), so x may or may not be NE of z.
   
   Actually, wait. If I have some values a, b, c such that a <= b and b <= c, then a <= c. By the transitivity of the <= relation.
   
   So, from supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we can't infer supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   Similarly, from supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we can't infer supx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   So, it's possible for x to be NE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

2. x N z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   As above, it's not guaranteed that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   And, we don't have direct constraints on how infx(x) relates to infx(z) or how supx(x) relates to supx(z).
   
   So, it's possible for x to be N of z, but it's not guaranteed.

3. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   As above, it's not guaranteed that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   And, from x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). From y W z, we have supx(y) <= infx(z). These don't directly give us supx(x) <= infx(z).
   
   So, it's possible for x to be NW of z, but it's not guaranteed.

4. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From y W z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y). From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x). These give us infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   But, we don't have direct constraints on how supx(x) relates to infx(z) or how supy(x) relates to supy(z).
   
   So, it's possible for x to be W of z, but it's not guaranteed.

5. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   As above, we can infer infy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   But, we don't have direct constraints on how supx(z) relates to infx(x) or how supy(x) relates to supy(z).
   
   So, it's possible for x to be E of z, but it's not guaranteed.

6. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From y W z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y). From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x). These give us infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) because if infy(z) <= infy(x), then infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which means infy(z) <= supy(x), contradicting supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. x S z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   Similarly, x cannot be S of z due to the contradiction with infy(z) <= infy(x).

8. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   Similarly, x cannot be SE of z due to the contradiction with infy(z) <= infy(x).

9. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   As shown earlier, we can infer infy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   But, we don't have direct constraints on how infx(x) relates to infx(z), how supx(x) relates to supx(z), or how supy(x) relates to supy(z).
   
   So, it's possible for x to be B of z, but it's not guaranteed.

Based on the above analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NE z
- x N z
- x NW z
- x W z
- x E z
- x B z

But, I need to be more careful here. Let me go back to the definitions and constraints, and see if I've missed anything.

From the definitions:
- x NE y means:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x)
  - supy(y) <= infy(x)

- y W z means:
  - supx(y) <= infx(z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

The constraint I'm certain of is infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x).

This means that the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x. Or equivalently, z doesn't extend further south than the bottom of x.

Importantly, This constraint would mean that anything where z extends past the bottom of x would be impossible. This would include the directional relations: SE, S, SW

This is consistent with my earlier conclusion that x cannot be SE, S, or SW of z.

It's great that I'm converging on the right answer. I seemed to make the problem too complex initially, but I arrived at consistent results in the end.

Given that I ruled out SE, S, and SW as possible relations, the potential relations are indeed:
- x NE z
- x N z
- x NW z
- x W z
- x E z
- x B z

Actually, I think I've been making an error in my logic. Let me go back to the basics.

From the definitions:
- x NE y means:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of y)
  - supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of y)

- y W z means:
  - supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the west of z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y and z overlap vertically)

From these, I've correctly inferred that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).

This means the southern boundary of z is below or at the same level as the southern boundary of x. In other words, z doesn't extend southward beyond the southern boundary of x.

Actually, let me be careful here. If infy(z) <= infy(x), this means the southern boundary of z is below or at the same level as the southern boundary of x. This doesn't restrict how far north z can extend. So, it's still possible for z to extend northward beyond the northern boundary of x.

For the east-west direction, from supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we can't directly infer a constraint between x and z in the east-west direction. x could be to the east, west, or anywhere horizontally relative to z.

Given these considerations, let's go over the possible relations between x and z again:

1. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of z)
   
   We know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't have a direct constraint on how supy(z) relates to infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) > infy(x) (z extends northward beyond the southern boundary of x) or supy(z) <= infy(x) (z doesn't extend northward beyond the southern boundary of x).
   
   Similarly, we don't have a direct constraint on how supx(z) relates to infx(x). x could be to the east, west, or horizontally aligned with z.
   
   So, it's possible for x to be NE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

Let me stop here and try to visualize the constraints. From the constraints:

1. x NE y: x is to the NE of y.
2. y W z: y is to the W of z.

Let's draw this out:

```
    x
      
y   z
```

From the constraints, we've inferred:

1. infy(z) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of z is below the southern boundary of x. This means z starts (in the y-direction) at or before x.

This basically means that z can extend northward, but it must start no lower (in the y-direction) than x.

Given this visualization, can x be NE of z? For x to be NE of z, it needs to be both north and east of z. We know x is north of y, and y can overlap vertically with z. Depending on how much they overlap, z could extend northward up to or beyond the northern boundary of x. If z doesn't extend past the northern boundary of x, then x can be NE of z.

Similarly, if z is pushed eastward such that its eastern boundary is to the west of the western boundary of x, then x is to the east of z. In this case, x would be NE of z.

Can x be N of z? Yes, if x is directly above z, meaning the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.

Hmm, actually that doesn't match what I wrote above, let's be precise.

If we have a region a and a region b, then a N b (a is north of b) means:
- infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)  (a and b overlap horizontally)
- supy(b) <= infy(a)  (a is above b)

So let me be even more careful here. From the constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of z is at or below the southern boundary of x.
- supy(y) <= infy(x): y is below x.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): z overlaps with y vertically.

Combining supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we don't get a direct constraint on how supy(z) relates to infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) > infy(x) (z extends northward beyond the southern boundary of x) or supy(z) <= infy(x) (z doesn't extend northward beyond the southern boundary of x).

For the east-west direction, we don't have direct constraints. x could be to the east, west, or horizontally aligned with z.

Based on this, what relations are possible between x and z?

1. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of z)
   
   If supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is NE of z.

This can be satisfied.

2. x N z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x and z overlap horizontally)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of z)
   
   If x and z overlap horizontally and supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is N of z.

This can be satisfied.

3. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of z)
   
   If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NW of z.

This can be satisfied.

4. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (x and z overlap vertically)
   
   We know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't have a direct constraint on how supy(x) relates to supy(z). If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.

This can be satisfied.

5. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x is within the bounding box of z in the x-dimension)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (x is within the bounding box of z in the y-dimension)
   
   We know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't have direct constraints on the other three conditions. If they're satisfied, then x is B of z.

This can be satisfied.

6. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the west of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (x and z overlap vertically)
   
   We know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't have direct constraints on the other two conditions. If they're satisfied, then x is W of z.

This can be satisfied.

7. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)  (x is to the south of z)
   
   From infy(z) <= infy(x), we have a contradiction with supy(x) <= infy(z). If the southern boundary of z is at or below the southern boundary of x, then x can't be strictly below z.

8. x S z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x and z overlap horizontally)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)  (x is to the south of z)
   
   Similarly, the constraints are contradictory.

9. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)  (x is to the south of z)
   
   Again, the constraints are contradictory.

So, the possible relations are:
- x NE z
- x N z
- x NW z
- x E z
- x B z
- x W z

But are there any other relations?

What about x B z?

Actually, let's use our visualization to simplify this. From the constraints:
- x is NE of y
- y is W of z
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (deduced)

```
    x
      
y   z
```

Given these:
- Can x be NE of z? Yes, if x is to the northeast of z.
- Can x be N of z? Yes, if x is directly above z.
- Can x be NW of z? Yes, if x is to the northwest of z.
- Can x be E of z? Yes, if x is directly to the east of z.
- Can x be SE of z? No, x must be at least partially north of z.
- Can x be S of z? No, x must be at least partially north of z.
- Can x be SW of z? No, x must be at least partially north of z.
- Can x be W of z? Yes, if x is directly to the west of z.
- Can x be B of z? Yes, if x is within the bounding box of z.

Actually, can x really be B of z? For x to be B of z, x must be entirely within the bounding box of z. Given that x is NE of y, and y is W of z, it's hard to see how x could be entirely within z's bounding box.

Let me reconsider the constraints. From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x). From y W z, we have supx(y) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From the constraints, we only know infy(z) <= infy(x). The other conditions aren't directly given, but they could be satisfied in certain configurations. So, it's possible for x to be B of z.

But honestly I'm not sure that's right. Let's look once more at our picture.

```
    x
      
y   z
```

The picture above is consistent with the constraints because x is NE of y, and y is W of z. We've deduced that infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the southern boundary of z is at or below the southern boundary of x.

For x to be B of z, x must be entirely within the bounding box of z. But, given that x is NE of y and y is W of z, it's not clear to me how x could be entirely within z's bounding box.

From a visual perspective, if x is NE of y, it's "above and to the right" of y. If y is W of z, it's "to the left" of z. It's hard to see how x, which is "above and to the right" of y, which in turn is "to the left" of z, could be entirely within z.

Actually let me be really careful here. From the constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x). We also know supx(y) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). And I've deduced infy(z) <= infy(x).

Actually, wait. I think when it comes to determining if x is fully contained within z, I need to consider *infy(x) <= infy(z)* (not the other way around) for containment. Let's check.

From the definition:
- x B z means:
  - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x is within the bounding box of z in the x-dimension)
  - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (x is within the bounding box of z in the y-dimension)

So I got the ordering correct. For x to be B of z, we need the bounding box of x to be within the bounding box of z. This means:
- The left of x is to the right of the left of z: infx(z) <= infx(x)
- The right of x is to the left of the right of z: supx(x) <= supx(z)
- The bottom of x is above the bottom of z: infy(z) <= infy(x)
- The top of x is below the top of z: supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given the original constraints, we've deduced infy(z) <= infy(x). The other three conditions for B aren't directly given, but they could be satisfied in certain configurations. So, it's possible for x to be B of z.

Let me re-examine our picture:

```
    x
      
y   z
```

Given that x is NE of y, and y is W of z, it's possible for x to be entirely within the bounding box of z. To check, imagine if z is really large and extends far to the right and far upwards, and x is just a little bit to the NE of y. In such a scenario, x would be inside the bounding box of z.

So, based on the constraints, I've deduced that the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NE z
- x N z
- x NW z
- x E z
- x B z
- x W z

This is the same set I determined earlier, which gives me confidence.

Alright, so the possible relations between region x and region z are NE, N, NW, E, B, W.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I'll determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is W of region z

From these constraints:
- x is to the northeast of y, so x is both north and east of y
- y is to the west of z and vertically aligned with z

From the relations above, I can deduce that:
- Since y is vertically aligned with z, and x is north of y, the southern boundary of x must be at or above the southern boundary of z
- The east-west relationship between x and z isn't fully constrained

The possible relations between x and z are:

- NE (Northeast): If x is both north of and east of z
- N (North): If x is directly north of z (horizontally aligned)
- NW (Northwest): If x is both north of and west of z
- E (East): If x is directly east of z (vertically aligned)
- W (West): If x is directly west of z (vertically aligned)
- B (Bounding box): If x is contained within z's bounding box
