PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

Given information:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions of the cardinal directions:

x NE y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
This means x is to the northeast of y, so x is both to the east and to the north of y.

y SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
This means y is to the southeast of z, so y is both to the east and to the south of z.

Now, let's see what we can deduce about the relation between x and z.

From x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(y) <= infy(x): x is to the north of y

From y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y): y is to the east of z
- supy(y) <= infy(z): y is to the south of z

Let's combine these to determine the relationship between x and z:

For the east-west dimension:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)

By transitivity, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z.

For the north-south dimension:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

We can't immediately deduce the north-south relationship between x and z because the inequality supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z) doesn't directly tell us whether infy(x) is less than, equal to, or greater than infy(z). We need to consider different cases.

Case 1: If infy(x) < infy(z), then x would be to the south of z, which combined with x being to the east of z, means x is SE of z.

Case 2: If infy(x) = infy(z), then x would be at the same latitude as z at its southern boundary. Combined with x being to the east of z, this could be considered as a boundary case between E and SE.

Case 3: If infy(x) > infy(z), then there are a few sub-cases to consider:
   
   Case 3a: If infy(x) > supy(z), then x would be to the north of z, which combined with x being to the east of z, means x is NE of z.
   
   Case 3b: If infy(x) <= supy(z), then x and z would overlap in the north-south dimension. Combined with x being to the east of z, this means x could be E of z.

So, in terms of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, we have three main possibilities: E, SE, and NE.

Let me double-check this reasoning.

Actually, there might be more nuances to consider. Let's try a slightly different approach.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y (x is to the northeast of y)
- Region y is SE of region z (y is to the southeast of z)

Let's place this in a coordinate system and see what we can deduce.

From x being NE of y:
- x is to the right (east) of y: infx(x) ≥ supx(y)
- x is above (north) of y: infy(x) ≥ supy(y)

From y being SE of z:
- y is to the right (east) of z: infx(y) ≥ supx(z)
- y is below (south) of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's see what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z:

For the east-west relationship:
- x is to the right of y (infx(x) ≥ supx(y))
- y is to the right of z (infx(y) ≥ supx(z))

By transitivity:
- infx(x) ≥ supx(y) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(z)
- Therefore, infx(x) ≥ supx(z), which means x is to the right (east) of z.

For the north-south relationship, it's a bit trickier:
- x is above y (infy(x) ≥ supy(y))
- y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

We can say:
- infy(x) ≥ supy(y) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SE z)

By transitivity:
- infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This doesn't give us a direct comparison between infy(x) and infy(z). We can have:
- infy(x) < infy(z): x is below z in the north-south dimension.
- infy(x) = infy(z): x and z have the same southern boundary.
- infy(x) > infy(z): x is above z in the north-south dimension.

Combined with the fact that x is to the east of z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

1. If infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) < infy(z), then x is SE of z.
2. If infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) ≥ infy(z), then x is E of z (they overlap in the north-south dimension).
3. If infy(x) = infy(z), then x is E of z (they start at the same latitude).
4. If infy(x) > infy(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NE of z.
5. If infy(x) > infy(z) and infy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is E of z (they overlap in the north-south dimension).

So, in summary, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: E, SE, and NE.

Let me just check if I might have missed any other possibilities:

Since x is NE of y, there is a strict separation between x and y. Similarly, since y is SE of z, there is a strict separation between y and z.

However, the relationship between x and z could potentially be more varied.

Given the constraints:
- x is to the east of z (established above)
- The north-south relationship can vary (as discussed above)

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

1. If x is strictly north of z, then x is NE of z.
2. If x and z overlap in the north-south dimension, then x is E of z.
3. If x is strictly south of z, then x is SE of z.

There are no other possibilities (like N, NW, W, SW, S, or B) given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, and SE.

Let me verify this conclusion with the original definitions:

x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
Given that x is east of z, we have supx(z) <= infx(x). If x is also north of z, we have supy(z) <= infy(x). So, NE is a possible relation.

x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
Given that x is east of z, we have supx(z) <= infx(x). If x and z overlap in the north-south dimension (meaning neither is strictly north or south of the other), then E is a possible relation.

x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
Given that x is east of z, we have supx(z) <= infx(x). If x is also south of z, we have supy(x) <= infy(z). So, SE is a possible relation.

Hmm, there's a discrepancy in my reasoning. Let's reconsider the north-south relationship.

From x being NE of y:
- x is to the right (east) of y: infx(x) ≥ supx(y)
- x is above (north) of y: infy(x) ≥ supy(y)

From y being SE of z:
- y is to the right (east) of z: infx(y) ≥ supx(z)
- y is below (south) of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For the north-south relationship:
- From x NE y: infy(x) ≥ supy(y)
- From y SE z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

By transitivity, we get:
- infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). We need to consider the possible cases:

1. infy(x) < infy(z): This means x extends below the southern boundary of z. But we also know that infy(x) ≥ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). This means infy(x) could be in the range [supy(y), infy(z)].

2. infy(x) = infy(z): This is a boundary case where x and z have the same southern boundary.

3. infy(x) > infy(z): This means x is entirely above the southern boundary of z.

Let's now consider the upper boundaries of x and z:

- For x: We don't have direct constraints on supy(x) from the given information.
- For z: We know from y SE z that supy(y) ≤ infy(z). But this doesn't directly constrain supy(z).

If supy(x) < infy(z), it means x is entirely below z. Combining this with the east-west relationship, x would be SE of z.

If supy(x) ≥ infy(z) but infy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x and z overlap in the north-south dimension. Combined with the east-west relationship, x would be E of z.

If infy(x) > supy(z), it means x is entirely above z. Combined with the east-west relationship, x would be NE of z.

So, considering all the constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Let me make sure my reasoning is correct. 

From x being NE of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(y) <= infy(x): x is to the north of y

From y being SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y): y is to the east of z
- supy(y) <= infy(z): y is to the south of z

For the east-west dimension:
- From x NE y and y SE z, by transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
- Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z. ✓

For the north-south dimension:
- From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x). ✓
- From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z). ✓

Combining these, we get supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z)). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z).

Let's consider the possible cases:

Case 1: infy(x) < infy(z)
- In this case, x extends below the southern boundary of z (though still above the northern boundary of y). 
- For the north-south relationship, we need to consider the upper boundaries of x and z.

Case 1.1: If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is entirely below z in the north-south dimension. Combined with the east-west relationship, x would be SE of z. ✓

Case 1.2: If supy(x) > infy(z), then x overlaps with z in the north-south dimension. Combined with the east-west relationship, x would be E of z. ✓

Case 2: infy(x) = infy(z)
- In this case, x and z have the same southern boundary.
- Similar to Case 1.2, this would result in x being E of z. ✓

Case 3: infy(x) > infy(z)
- In this case, the southern boundary of x is above the southern boundary of z.

Case 3.1: If infy(x) <= supy(z), then x overlaps with z in the north-south dimension. Combined with the east-west relationship, x would be E of z. ✓

Case 3.2: If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is entirely above z in the north-south dimension. Combined with the east-west relationship, x would be NE of z. ✓

So, considering all the possible cases, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Actually wait, let me try to reason about this a bit more, because I'm not sure I've done it correctly. Let me consider a few specific cases:

1. Let's consider the case where z is a unit square with its bottom-left corner at the origin (0, 0) and its top-right corner at (1, 1). And let's say y is SE of z, specifically a unit square with its bottom-left corner at (1.5, -0.5) and its top-right corner at (2.5, 0.5). Further, let's say x is NE of y, specifically a unit square with its bottom-left corner at (3, 0.5) and its top-right corner at (4, 1.5).

In this scenario, z is at (0, 0) to (1, 1), y is at (1.5, -0.5) to (2.5, 0.5), and x is at (3, 0.5) to (4, 1.5).

Relative to z, we have:
- infx(x) = 3 > supx(z) = 1 (x is east of z)
- infy(x) = 0.5 < infy(z) = 0 (x is not south of z)
- infy(x) = 0.5 < supy(z) = 1 (x is not north of z)

Given these, the relation would be E.

2. Let's adjust the position of x to be more north. Say x is now a unit square with its bottom-left corner at (3, 1.5) and its top-right corner at (4, 2.5).

In this scenario, z remains at (0, 0) to (1, 1), y is at (1.5, -0.5) to (2.5, 0.5), and x is now at (3, 1.5) to (4, 2.5).

Relative to z, we have:
- infx(x) = 3 > supx(z) = 1 (x is east of z)
- infy(x) = 1.5 > supy(z) = 1 (x is north of z)

Given these, the relation would be NE.

3. Let's adjust the position of x to be more south. Say x is now a unit square with its bottom-left corner at (3, -1.5) and its top-right corner at (4, -0.5).

In this scenario, z remains at (0, 0) to (1, 1), y is at (1.5, -0.5) to (2.5, 0.5), and x is now at (3, -1.5) to (4, -0.5).

Relative to z, we have:
- infx(x) = 3 > supx(z) = 1 (x is east of z)
- supy(x) = -0.5 < infy(z) = 0 (x is south of z)

Given these, the relation would be SE.

So, based on these specific cases, it seems like the possible relations between x and z are indeed NE, E, and SE. Let me double check using the formal definitions:

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- Region y is SE of region z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For the east-west relation between x and z:
- From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). ✓
- From y SE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). ✓
- Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z. ✓

For the north-south relation between x and z, we need to consider:
- From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x). ✓
- From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z). ✓

Let's check the three possible relations:

1. x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). For x to be NE of z, we also need supy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible, but not guaranteed from the given information.

2. x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). The other two conditions determine if x and z overlap in the north-south dimension. Given the constraints, this is possible, but not guaranteed.

3. x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). For x to be SE of z, we also need supy(x) <= infy(z). This is possible, but not guaranteed from the given information.

So, considering the constraints from the given information, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Wait, I think I might have misunderstood some of the conditions. Let me clarify.

x NE y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
This means x is to the northeast of y, meaning x is both to the right (east) of y and above (north) of y.

y SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
This means y is to the southeast of z, meaning y is both to the right (east) of z and below (south) of z.

Let's reanalyze:

For the east-west dimension:
- From x NE y, we know x is to the right of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) ✓
- From y SE z, we know y is to the right of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) ✓
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) ✓
- Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right (east) of z. ✓

For the north-south dimension:
- From x NE y, we know x is above y: supy(y) <= infy(x) ✓
- From y SE z, we know y is below z: supy(y) <= infy(z) ✓

From these, we can say that supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z)). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), nor does it directly constrain the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and supy(z).

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

1. x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). For the condition supy(z) <= infy(x), we have no direct constraint from the given information, so it could be true or false.

2. x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). For the other two conditions, we have no direct constraints from the given information, so they could be true or false.

3. x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). For the condition supy(x) <= infy(z), we have no direct constraint from the given information, so it could be true or false.

Given the constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Let me try to understand the problem a bit more by considering the geometric positioning of regions x, y, and z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y.
- Region y is SE of region z.

We are asking for the possible relationships between x and z.

In terms of cardinal directions: 
- If x is NE of y, it means x is positioned to the north and east of y.
- If y is SE of z, it means y is positioned to the south and east of z.

Geometrically, we have:
- z at some position (let's say the origin for reference).
- y to the southeast of z.
- x to the northeast of y.

So, if we place z at the origin, y would be somewhere to the southeast quadrant, and x would be somewhere to the northeast quadrant relative to y.

Given this, x will always be to the east of z. But the north-south relationship can vary depending on the specific positions of the regions.

If y is far enough south relative to z, and x is not too far north relative to y, then x could be to the south of z, making the relation x SE z.

If y is closer to z in the north-south dimension, and x is far enough north relative to y, then x could be to the north of z, making the relation x NE z.

And if the north-south positions are just right, x could be directly to the east of z, making the relation x E z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Let's check if I'm making any errors in my reasoning.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- Region y is SE of region z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

For the east-west relation between x and z:
By transitivity of supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.

For the north-south relation, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

These don't give us a direct constraint on the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z).

However, let's consider some specific positionings to verify:

1. z is at (0, 0) to (1, 1), y is at (2, -1) to (3, 0), and x is at (4, 1) to (5, 2).
In this case, x is NE of z.

2. z is at (0, 0) to (1, 1), y is at (2, -1) to (3, 0), and x is at (4, 0) to (5, 1).
In this case, x is E of z.

3. z is at (0, 0) to (1, 1), y is at (2, -1) to (3, 0), and x is at (4, -2) to (5, -1).
In this case, x is SE of z.

These examples confirm that NE, E, and SE are all possible relations between x and z.

So, based on the original question, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, and SE.

Let me make sure again though. Let me actually verify that these are all the possibilities. I will try to check if there are cases where x could be NW, SW, etc.

If y is SE of z, then supx(z) <= infx(y). And if x is NE of y, then supx(y) <= infx(x). By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(x). This means that x is strictly to the east of z. This is consistent with x being NE of z, E of z, or SE of z, but not with any other cardinal direction relation that requires x to be to the west or directly on top of z (like N, S, NW, W, SW, or B).

My last answer then holds: the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, and SE.

I'm concerned that I might be missing something, because I'm assuming that region is a 2D shape. Let me just double check the problem statement one more time to make sure regions are not intervals or other weird objects.

I just realized that in the problem statement, I'm supposed to use the definitions of cardinal directions. Here they are:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b),
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b),
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b),
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b),
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a),
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b),
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a),
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b),
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Let's use these definitions directly.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Let's check what constraints these place on the relationship between x and z:

From the east-west perspective:
- From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
- From y SE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us supx(z) <= infx(x).

This means x is to the east of z.

From the north-south perspective:
- From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
- From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

These don't give us a direct comparison between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z). We need to consider different scenarios.

Let's check the possible relations:

1. x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x B z is not possible.

2. x S z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x S z is not possible.

3. x SW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

4. x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x NW z is not possible.

6. x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x N z is not possible.

7. x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). For the condition supy(z) <= infy(x), we have no direct constraint from the given information, so it could be true or false. Thus, x NE z is a possible relation.

8. x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). For the other two conditions, we have no direct constraints from the given information, so they could be true or false. Thus, x E z is a possible relation.

9. x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). For the condition supy(x) <= infy(z), we have no direct constraint from the given information, so it could be true or false. Thus, x SE z is a possible relation.

So, from all the cardinal direction relations, only NE, E, and SE are possible for the relationship between x and z.

To give a final answer: the possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE.

Actually, just before submitting, let me go through the definitions once more to make sure I'm not making an error.

a B b if and only if:
- infx(b) <= infx(a): The left edge of a is not to the left of the left edge of b.
- supx(a) <= supx(b): The right edge of a is not to the right of the right edge of b.
- infy(b) <= infy(a): The bottom edge of a is not below the bottom edge of b.
- supy(a) <= supy(b): The top edge of a is not above the top edge of b.
In other words, a is contained within the bounding box of b.

a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) <= infy(b): The top edge of a is below or on the bottom edge of b.
- infx(b) <= infx(a): The left edge of a is not to the left of the left edge of b.
- supx(a) <= supx(b): The right edge of a is not to the right of the right edge of b.
In other words, a is to the south of b and within the west-east bounds of b.

a SW b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b): The right edge of a is to the left of or on the left edge of b.
- supy(a) <= infy(b): The top edge of a is below or on the bottom edge of b.
In other words, a is to the southwest of b.

a W b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b): The right edge of a is to the left of or on the left edge of b.
- infy(b) <= infy(a): The bottom edge of a is not below the bottom edge of b.
- supy(a) <= supy(b): The top edge of a is not above the top edge of b.
In other words, a is to the west of b and within the north-south bounds of b.

a NW b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b): The right edge of a is to the left of or on the left edge of b.
- supy(b) <= infy(a): The top edge of b is below or on the bottom edge of a.
In other words, a is to the northwest of b.

a N b if and only if:
- supy(b) <= infy(a): The top edge of b is below or on the bottom edge of a.
- infx(b) <= infx(a): The left edge of a is not to the left of the left edge of b.
- supx(a) <= supx(b): The right edge of a is not to the right of the right edge of b.
In other words, a is to the north of b and within the west-east bounds of b.

a NE b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a): The right edge of b is to the left of or on the left edge of a.
- supy(b) <= infy(a): The top edge of b is below or on the bottom edge of a.
In other words, a is to the northeast of b.

a E b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a): The right edge of b is to the left of or on the left edge of a.
- infy(b) <= infy(a): The bottom edge of a is not below the bottom edge of b.
- supy(a) <= supy(b): The top edge of a is not above the top edge of b.
In other words, a is to the east of b and within the north-south bounds of b.

a SE b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a): The right edge of b is to the left of or on the left edge of a.
- supy(a) <= infy(b): The top edge of a is below or on the bottom edge of b.
In other words, a is to the southeast of b.

Now, given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

For the east-west relation, by transitivity, we have supx(z) <= infx(x). This means that x is strictly to the east of z.

For the north-south relation, let's see what can be inferred:
- From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
- From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

This doesn't directly tell us anything about the relation between infy(x) and infy(z). The condition on the upper bound of y, supy(y), doesn't help us deduce the relation between the upper bounds of x and z, nor does it help us deduce the relation between the lower bound of x, infy(x), and the upper bound of z, supy(z).

Given all this, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NE z
- x E z
- x SE z

All other relations are ruled out because they either require x to be to the west of z or within the west-east bounds of z, which contradicts our finding that x is strictly to the east of z.

So, my final answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, and SE.

Actually, I realize there's a slight mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let's clarify the definitions:

x NE y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
This means x is to the northeast of y, with x being strictly to the east and strictly to the north of y.

y SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
This means y is to the southeast of z, with y being strictly to the east and strictly to the south of z.

For the east-west relation:
- From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
- From y SE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(x).
This means x is strictly to the east of z, so any relation between x and z must involve x being to the east of z.

For the north-south relation:
- From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
- From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

This doesn't tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z). Let's consider different scenarios:

1. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is strictly to the north of z. Combined with x being strictly to the east of z, this means x is NE of z.

2. If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is within the north-south bounds of z. Combined with x being strictly to the east of z, this means x is E of z.

3. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is strictly to the south of z. Combined with x being strictly to the east of z, this means x is SE of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, and SE.

Actually, wait, I think the definition of the relation has changed compared to what I initially had. Initially, I had for instance the NE relation, x NE y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x). But in the provided definitions, a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

Actually, after checking, it appears that the definitions align with what I've been using. It's just a matter of variable names:

- NE: 
  * a NE b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
  * x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

- SE:
  * a SE b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
  * y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

They're consistent.

So, based on all the analysis:
The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, and SE.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, SE.

I'll analyze the constraints to determine this:

Given:
- x is NE of y ⟹ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SE of z ⟹ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For the east-west relationship:
From transitivity: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
Therefore: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

This means x must be strictly east of z, which eliminates all possibilities except NE, E, and SE.

For the north-south relationship:
We know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), but this doesn't directly constrain the relationship between x and z in the north-south dimension.

Therefore, all three remaining possibilities are valid:
- NE: if x is north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- E: if x overlaps with z in the north-south dimension
- SE: if x is south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
