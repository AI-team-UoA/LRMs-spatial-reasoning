PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that:
1. x is SE of y
2. y is SW of z

Let's analyze what these conditions mean in terms of the coordinate constraints:

**x is SE of y:**
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

**y is SW of z:**
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Now, let's try to determine the possible relation between x and z by combining these constraints.

From the constraints:
- We know that supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (because x is SE of y)
- We know that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (because y is SW of z)

From these two, we can't directly infer a relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z). This means x could be east of z, west of z, or they could overlap in the x-direction.

Similarly, for the y-coordinates:
- We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (because x is SE of y)
- We know that supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (because y is SW of z)

Transitively, we can deduce that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

So, in terms of the y-coordinate, x is definitely south of z.
In terms of the x-coordinate, x could be east, west, or they could overlap.

Given these constraints, let's list the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

**1. S (South):** If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x and z overlap in the x-direction), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z).

**2. SE (South East):** If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z).

**3. SW (South West):** If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z).

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let's analyze more precisely.

Given:
- x is SE of y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Let's use transitivity to see what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z.

For the x-coordinate:
- From x is SE of y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- From y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

From these, we can't directly determine the relation between infx(x) and infx(z) without knowing more about supx(y).

For the y-coordinate:
- From x is SE of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y is SW of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Again, without knowing more about infy(y), we can't directly determine the relation between supy(x) and infy(z).

However, I realize that, if we're given that x is SE of y, then x is to the east and south of y. And if y is SW of z, then y is to the west and south of z. 

Let's try a visual approach.

If we represent the regions on an x-y plane:
- x is to the bottom-right (southeast) of y.
- y is to the bottom-left (southwest) of z.

Where could x be relative to z? It's to the bottom-right of a point that's to the bottom-left of z.

In the x-direction:
x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z.
So, x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or they could overlap.

In the y-direction:
x is below y, and y is below z.
This implies that x is definitely below z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations of x to z are:
- S (South): If x is below z and their x-projections overlap.
- SE (South East): If x is below and to the right of z.
- SW (South West): If x is below and to the left of z.

Actually, let's rethink this more carefully using the actual definitions.

For reference, the definitions relevant to this problem are:

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).

a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).

Given:
- x is SE of y: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). In other words, x is to the right (east) of y and below (south) of y.
- y is SW of z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). In other words, y is to the left (west) of z and below (south) of z.

Let's think about the possible configurations of x, y, and z.

If you consider a grid:
1. z is in the top-right quadrant.
2. y is below and to the left of z (i.e., y is SW of z).
3. x is below and to the right of y (i.e., x is SE of y).

Where could x be relative to z?

a. x could be below z and to the left (x is SW of z).
b. x could be directly below z (x is S of z).
c. x could be below z and to the right (x is SE of z).

Let's check the constraints to confirm these possibilities.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This constraint is not necessarily satisfied. Since x is to the right of y and y is to the left of z, x could be anywhere along the x-axis relative to z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This is consistent with our given information. x is below y, and y is below z, so x is definitely below z.

For x to be S of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z): Again, the x-coordinate relation is not determined by our given constraints.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This is consistent with our given information.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This constraint is not necessarily satisfied.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This is consistent with our given information.

So, from the y-coordinate perspective, x is definitely below z. But from the x-coordinate perspective, the relationship between x and z is not constrained by the given information.

Given that, let's reconsider the possibilities. Given the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

1. For x to be S of z:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This is definitely true from our given information.
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z): This means the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z. This is possible but not guaranteed.

2. For x to be SW of z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This means x is to the left of z.
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This is definitely true.

3. For x to be SE of z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This means x is to the right of z.
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This is definitely true.

4. For x to be B of z (inside the bounding box of z):
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z): Since supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (as we deduced earlier), and infy(z) by definition is less than or equal to supy(z), we know that supy(x) ≤ supy(z). However, there's no guarantee that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). In fact, since x is below z, we'd expect infy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts the condition for x to be B of z. So, x cannot be B of z.

5. For x to be W of z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This means x is to the left of z.
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z): But since x is below z, we'd expect infy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts the condition for x to be W of z. So, x cannot be W of z.

6. For x to be E of z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This means x is to the right of z.
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z): But since x is below z, we'd expect infy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts the condition for x to be E of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

7. For x to be N of z, NW of z, or NE of z:
   - These all require x to be above z in the y-coordinate, which contradicts the fact that x is below z. So, x cannot be N, NW, or NE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. S (South)
2. SW (South West)
3. SE (South East)

Let's double-check our reasoning.

Given:
- x is SE of y: This means x is to the right (east) and below (south) of y.
- y is SW of z: This means y is to the left (west) and below (south) of z.

Let's visualize this.

```
    z
   /
  y
 /
x
```

In this diagram, x is to the right of y, y is to the left of z, and both x and y are below z. x could be to the left, directly below, or to the right of z, corresponding to the relations SW, S, and SE respectively.

Let me check the constraints again:

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This means the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This means the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z. Based on the given information, we know that x is below y, and y is below z. So, x is definitely below z. This constraint holds.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This holds, as we've established.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z): This means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. This could happen if x is aligned with z in the x-direction.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This means x is to the right of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This holds, as we've established.

Let's try another approach to be certain. Let's consider the possible locations of x, y, and z on the coordinate plane:

- Let's place z at the origin (0, 0).
- Since y is SW of z, y must be in the third quadrant (negative x, negative y).
- Since x is SE of y, x must be to the right of y and below y.

Given these constraints, where could x be?
- x could be in the third quadrant, to the right of y and below y, but still to the left of z. This would make x SW of z.
- x could be on the negative y-axis, directly below z. This would make x S of z.
- x could be in the fourth quadrant, to the right of z and below z. This would make x SE of z.

This confirms our earlier conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are:
1. S (South)
2. SW (South West)
3. SE (South East)

Let me provide a more concrete visualization. Let's denote regions by their minimum bounding boxes for clarity.

Let's say z's minimum bounding box is [0, 10] × [0, 10] on the coordinate plane.
Since y is SW of z, y's bounding box is entirely to the left and below z. Let's say it's [-15, -5] × [-15, -5].
Given that x is SE of y, x's bounding box is entirely to the right and below y.

Let's consider three different possibilities for x's location:

Case 1: x is located at [-20, -10] × [-30, -20].
In this case:
- supx(x) = -10, which is less than infx(z) = 0. So, x is to the left of z.
- supy(x) = -20, which is less than infy(z) = 0. So, x is below z.
This makes x SW of z.

Case 2: x is located at [5, 15] × [-20, -10].
In this case:
- The x-projection of x [5, 15] overlaps with the x-projection of z [0, 10].
- supy(x) = -10, which is less than infy(z) = 0. So, x is below z.
This makes x S of z.

Case 3: x is located at [15, 25] × [-20, -10].
In this case:
- infx(x) = 15, which is greater than supx(z) = 10. So, x is to the right of z.
- supy(x) = -10, which is less than infy(z) = 0. So, x is below z.
This makes x SE of z.

Actually, I see a mistake I made in case 2. Let me re-check the definition of the S relation.

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This means x is below z, which holds.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x): This means the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z): This means the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z.

The last two conditions together mean that the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. In case 2, I said the x-projection of x is [5, 15] and the x-projection of z is [0, 10]. Clearly, 5 > 0, so the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z. But 15 > 10, so the rightmost point of x is not to the left of the rightmost point of z. This means the x-projection of x is not contained within the x-projection of z, so x is not S of z.

Let me revise Case 2:

Case 2: x is located at [2, 8] × [-20, -10].
In this case:
- infx(x) = 2, which is greater than infx(z) = 0. So, the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z.
- supx(x) = 8, which is less than supx(z) = 10. So, the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z.
- supy(x) = -10, which is less than infy(z) = 0. So, x is below z.
This makes x S of z.

Actually, I made another mistake. The S relation doesn't require the x-projection of x to be contained within the x-projection of z. It just requires the x-projections to overlap. Let me be very precise with the definition:

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

This definition says that for a to be S of b:
1. a is below b (supy(a) ≤ infy(b)).
2. The leftmost point of a is to the right of the leftmost point of b (infx(b) ≤ infx(a)).
3. The rightmost point of a is to the left of the rightmost point of b (supx(a) ≤ supx(b)).

The last two conditions together mean that the x-projection of a is contained within the x-projection of b.

Going back to my Case 2, where x is located at [5, 15] × [-20, -10]:
- supy(x) = -10, which is less than infy(z) = 0. So, x is below z. (Condition 1 holds)
- infx(x) = 5, which is greater than infx(z) = 0. So, the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z. (Condition 2 holds)
- supx(x) = 15, which is greater than supx(z) = 10. So, the rightmost point of x is not to the left of the rightmost point of z. (Condition 3 does not hold)

Since all three conditions don't hold, x is not S of z in this case.

Let me correct Case 2 with an example that actually satisfies the S relation:

Case 2: x is located at [2, 8] × [-20, -10].
In this case:
- supy(x) = -10, which is less than infy(z) = 0. So, x is below z. (Condition 1 holds)
- infx(x) = 2, which is greater than infx(z) = 0. So, the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z. (Condition 2 holds)
- supx(x) = 8, which is less than supx(z) = 10. So, the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z. (Condition 3 holds)

Since all three conditions hold, x is S of z in this case.

Ok so the 3 possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. SW (South West)
2. S (South)
3. SE (South East)

Actually, I just realized I miswrote the definition of S (South) in my explanation above, which is incorrect. 

The correct definition for the S relation is:

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

This says that for a to be S of b:
1. a is below b (supy(a) ≤ infy(b)).
2. The leftmost point of a is to the right of or at the leftmost point of b (infx(b) ≤ infx(a)).
3. The rightmost point of a is to the left of or at the rightmost point of b (supx(a) ≤ supx(b)).

Let me re-check the S relation for the case where x is at [5, 15] × [-20, -10] and z is at [0, 10] × [0, 10]:

- supy(x) = -10, which is less than infy(z) = 0. So, x is below z. (Condition 1 holds)
- infx(z) = 0, which is less than infx(x) = 5. So, the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z. (Condition 2 holds)
- supx(x) = 15, which is greater than supx(z) = 10. So, the rightmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of z. (Condition 3 does not hold)

Since not all three conditions hold, x is not S of z in this case. x would actually be SE of z in this case because supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) < infy(z).

Let me redo Case 2 to show an example where x is S of z:

Case 2: x is located at [2, 8] × [-20, -10].
In this case:
- supy(x) = -10, which is less than infy(z) = 0. So, x is below z. (Condition 1 holds)
- infx(z) = 0, which is less than infx(x) = 2. So, the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z. (Condition 2 holds)
- supx(x) = 8, which is less than supx(z) = 10. So, the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z. (Condition 3 holds)

Since all three conditions hold, x is S of z in this case.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. SW (South West): If x is to the left and below z.
2. S (South): If x is directly below z, with its x-projection contained within the x-projection of z.
3. SE (South East): If x is to the right and below z.

Let me make one more check of all of these using the formal definitions.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This means the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This means the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This means the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x): This means the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z): This means the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This means the leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This means the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z.

Given that:
- x is SE of y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

From the y-coordinate constraints, we get:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x is SE of y).
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y is SW of z).
Given that the sup (supremum) of a set is less than or equal to the inf (infimum) of another set, we can chain these inequalities to get:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
This gives us supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z. This confirms that, from the y-coordinate perspective, x is below z.

From the x-coordinate constraints, we get:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x is SE of y).
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y is SW of z).
These tell us the rightmost point of y is to the left of both the leftmost point of x and the leftmost point of z. But we don't know the relation between the leftmost point of x and the leftmost point of z.

I think my analysis is correct. Given the constraints, we can confirm that x is below z in the y-coordinate. But in the x-coordinate, x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or they could overlap.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, and SE.

Actually, let's double-check the case for S.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This means the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z. From our chain of inequalities, we already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so this holds.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x): This means the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z): This means the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z.

Given that:
- x is SE of y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Our constraints don't directly give us information about the relation between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z). So, it's possible for x to be S of z, as I showed in my example where x is at [2, 8] × [-20, -10] and z is at [0, 10] × [0, 10].

I think my analysis is consistent, and the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, and SE.

Let me re-examine the case for S to make absolutely sure. Let's choose a more general case where y is at [-10, -5] × [-10, -5] and z is at [0, 10] × [0, 10].

The SE relation, as correctly given, requires supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
So, supx(y) = -5 ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y) = -10.

Let's assume x is at [a, b] × [c, d] for some values a, b, c, d.
For x to be SE of y:
- -5 ≤ a: The leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of y.
- d ≤ -10: The topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of y.

For x to be S of z:
- d ≤ 0: The topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z.
- 0 ≤ a: The leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z.
- b ≤ 10: The rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z.

Let's check if there are values a, b, c, d that satisfy all of these constraints.
From the conditions for x to be SE of y and S of z:
- -5 ≤ a: From x is SE of y.
- 0 ≤ a: From x is S of z.
- b ≤ 10: From x is S of z.
- d ≤ -10: From x is SE of y.
- d ≤ 0: From x is S of z.

We also know that a ≤ b and c ≤ d, since these are the bounds of the region.

One set of values that satisfies all these constraints is: a = 0, b = 10, c = -15, d = -10.
So, x can be at [0, 10] × [-15, -10].

Let's verify:
For x to be SE of y:
- supx(y) = -5 ≤ infx(x) = 0. Holds.
- supy(x) = -10 ≤ infy(y) = -10. Holds.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) = -10 ≤ infy(z) = 0. Holds.
- infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 0. Holds.
- supx(x) = 10 ≤ supx(z) = 10. Holds.

So, x can be S of z.

Similar checks can be done to show that x can also be SW or SE of z. Let me check SW to be thorough.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): The rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): The topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z.

From the previous constraints, we established that d ≤ 0 (where d is the topmost point of x), so the second condition for x to be SW of z, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), holds.

For the first condition, we need b ≤ 0, where b is the rightmost point of x.

Given that:
- -5 ≤ a: From x is SE of y.
- a ≤ b: By the definition of region bounds.
- b ≤ 0: The condition for x to be SW of z.
- d ≤ -10: From x is SE of y.
- c ≤ d: By the definition of region bounds.

One set of values that satisfies all these constraints is: a = -5, b = -1, c = -15, d = -10.
So, x can be at [-5, -1] × [-15, -10].

Let's verify:
For x to be SE of y:
- supx(y) = -5 ≤ infx(x) = -5. Holds.
- supy(x) = -10 ≤ infy(y) = -10. Holds.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(z) = 0. Holds.
- supy(x) = -10 ≤ infy(z) = 0. Holds.

So, x can also be SW of z.

Now, let's check SE.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x): The leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): The topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z.

As before, we've established that d ≤ 0, so the second condition for x to be SE of z, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), holds.

For the first condition, we need 10 ≤ a, where a is the leftmost point of x.

Given that:
- -5 ≤ a: From x is SE of y.
- 10 ≤ a: The condition for x to be SE of z.
- a ≤ b: By the definition of region bounds.
- d ≤ -10: From x is SE of y.
- c ≤ d: By the definition of region bounds.

One set of values that satisfies all these constraints is: a = 10, b = 15, c = -15, d = -10.
So, x can be at [10, 15] × [-15, -10].

Let's verify:
For x to be SE of y:
- supx(y) = -5 ≤ infx(x) = 10. Holds.
- supy(x) = -10 ≤ infy(y) = -10. Holds.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) = 10 ≤ infx(x) = 10. Holds.
- supy(x) = -10 ≤ infy(z) = 0. Holds.

So, x can also be SE of z.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. S (South)
2. SW (South West)
3. SE (South East)

Given the formal definitions and our detailed analysis, I'm confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints:
1. Region x is SE of region y
2. Region y is SW of region z

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

From these constraints:
- Since x is SE of y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- Since y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From the y-coordinate constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x is SE of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y is SW of z)
This yields: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
So in the y-direction, x is definitely south of z.

For the x-direction:
The constraints don't directly determine whether x is east, west, or overlapping with z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
S, SW, SE
