PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible cardinal directions that region x can have in relation to region z, given that:
1. Region x is B (bounding box) of region y.
2. Region y is S (South) of region z.

Let's first understand what each of these relations means:

- x B y means that region x is inside the bounding box of region y. Specifically, infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

- y S z means that region y is to the south of region z. Specifically, supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Now, let's try to determine the bounds of x in relation to z.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), meaning that infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), meaning that supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), meaning that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Now, let's check each cardinal direction relation to see if it's possible between x and z.

1. x B z: 
   - For this, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We also know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (since infy(z) ≤ supy(z) for any region z).
   - Therefore, x cannot be B z.

2. x S z:
   - For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We already know all three of these conditions are met.
   - Therefore, x can be S z.

3. x SW z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We already know supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - But we don't know if supx(x) ≤ infx(z). In fact, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which suggests supx(x) might be greater than infx(z).
   - However, it's still possible that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) if x is positioned in a certain way.
   - Therefore, x can be SW z.

4. x W z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We already know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We don't know if infy(z) ≤ infy(x). But since supy(x) ≤ infy(z), it's not possible for infy(z) to be less than or equal to infy(x) (since infy(x) ≤ supy(x) for any region x).
   - Therefore, x cannot be W z.

Wait, I need to be more careful. Let's reconsider what we know:

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), meaning infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), meaning supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), but we can't directly relate infy(x) to infy(z).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), meaning supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Let's now consider each cardinal direction relation again:

1. x B z: 
   - For this, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which implies supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).
   - But we can't guarantee infy(z) ≤ infy(x). In fact, from supy(x) ≤ infy(z), it seems unlikely.
   - Therefore, x is probably not B z.

2. x S z:
   - For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know all of these conditions are met.
   - Therefore, x can be S z.

3. x SW z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - But we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) for any region x).
   - Therefore, x cannot be SW z.

Wait, I misunderstood and then made a mistake in my new approach. Let's be even more precise. I need to consider the constraints and then see what's possible based on the definitions given.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we can make the following deductions:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

We know that x is inside y's bounding box, and y is completely to the south of z. Given these constraints, there are several possible relationships between x and z.

Let's check each of the nine cardinal direction relations systematically:

1. x B z: 
   - For this, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We have established infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - Knowing supy(x) ≤ infy(z) means that x doesn't reach as high in the y-direction as z's lowest point. This contradicts the requirement for B that infy(z) ≤ infy(x), because infy(z) is higher than any point in x.
   - Therefore, x cannot be B z.

2. x S z:
   - For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We've established all three conditions.
   - Therefore, x can be S z.

3. x SW z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - But we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ supx(x) (since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) for any region x).
   - This contradicts the requirement for SW that supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - Therefore, x cannot be SW z.

4. x W z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - But we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ supx(x).
   - This contradicts the requirement for W that supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - Additionally, the condition for W requires infy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means infy(x) can't be above infy(z).
   - Therefore, x cannot be W z.

5. x NW z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - But we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - And we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means it's unlikely that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), since supy(z) is higher than infy(z), which is higher than supy(x), which is higher than infy(x). So supy(z) is higher than infy(x).
   - Therefore, x cannot be NW z.

6. x N z:
   - For this, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - But we also know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which suggests that x is below z in terms of the y-coordinate.
   - This contradicts the requirement for N that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - Therefore, x cannot be N z.

7. x NE z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - But we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≥ infx(z) is not necessarily less than infx(x).
   - And we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means it's unlikely that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - Therefore, x cannot be NE z.

8. x E z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - But we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which doesn't guarantee supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Additionally, knowing supy(x) ≤ infy(z) makes it unlikely that infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - Therefore, x is probably not E z.

9. x SE z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - But we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which doesn't guarantee supx(z) ≤ infx(x). In fact, given the context, it's more likely that supx(z) ≥ infx(x).
   - Therefore, x is probably not SE z.

Let me reevaluate. I can definitively say that x can be S z.

Actually, I'm going to be even more systematic here. The reason is that the way regions can be positioned still allows for some flexibility.

Let's visualize a scenario. We know x is inside y's bounding box, and y is south of z.

This means x is constrained to be in y's bounding box, and y is constrained to be below z.

From x B y:
- x is contained within the bounding box of y.

From y S z:
- Region y is to the south of region z.
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Given that x is contained within y, and y is contained within the region bounded by infx(z) and supx(z) in the x-direction, and below infy(z) in the y-direction, what are the possible positions of x in relation to z?

Let's check each cardinal direction relation again:

1. x B z:
   - For this, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and since x is inside y's bounding box, infx(z) can be ≤ infx(x).
   - Similarly, supx(y) ≤ supx(z), and x is inside y's bounding box, so supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - Since y is south of z, supy(y) ≤ infy(z). And since x is inside y's bounding box, supy(x) ≤ supy(y). Thus, supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), it can't be true that infy(z) ≤ infy(x), because infy(x) < supy(x) for any region x.
   - Therefore, x cannot be B z.

2. x S z:
   - For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x B y), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Similarly, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - All three conditions are met.
   - Therefore, x can be S z.

3. x SW z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as established above.
   - But we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x). 
   - But if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), then it can't be the case that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (since infx(x) < supx(x)).
   - Therefore, x cannot be SW z.

4. x W z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - As established, infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means it can't be the case that supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - Therefore, x cannot be W z.

5. x NW z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - As established, infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means it can't be the case that supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - Therefore, x cannot be NW z.

6. x N z:
   - For this, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) from previous derivations.
   - But we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is entirely below the lowest point of z. This means x can't be north of z.
   - Therefore, x cannot be N z.

7. x NE z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - But we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is entirely below the lowest point of z. This means x can't be north of z.
   - Therefore, x cannot be NE z.

8. x E z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - But we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means it can't be the case that infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - Therefore, x cannot be E z.

9. x SE z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We also know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But for x to be SE of z, z's x-coordinates should be to the left of x's. Given the constraints, it's possible that supx(z) is not less than or equal to infx(x).
   - Note: I'm a bit uncertain here, so let me think more about it...

Actually, I think I'm being a bit sloppy in my reasoning. Let me start from the base definitions and think through the possible configurations more systematically.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y S z, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Let's check each cardinal direction relation:

1. x B z:
   - For this, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We've established that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - Since supy(x) ≤ infy(z), and for any region z, infy(z) ≤ supy(z), we can say supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - However, the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) conflicts with supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (since for any region x, infy(x) ≤ supy(x)).
   - Therefore, x cannot be B z.

2. x S z:
   - For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We've established all of these conditions.
   - Therefore, x can be S z.

3. x SW z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - But we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which, for any region x, means infx(z) ≤ supx(x) (since infx(x) ≤ supx(x)).
   - This contradicts the condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - Therefore, x cannot be SW z.

4. x W z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - Similar to the SW relation, the condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z) conflicts with our knowledge that infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Therefore, x cannot be W z.

5. x NW z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - As with the above, the condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z) conflicts with our knowledge.
   - Additionally, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. This contradicts the condition for NW that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - Therefore, x cannot be NW z.

6. x N z:
   - For this, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) conflicts with our knowledge that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (since this means x is entirely below z).
   - Therefore, x cannot be N z.

7. x NE z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - As with N, the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) conflicts with our knowledge.
   - Additionally, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which suggests supx(z) can be greater than infx(x). This doesn't guarantee supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Therefore, x cannot be NE z.

8. x E z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. This conflicts with the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - Therefore, x cannot be E z.

9. x SE z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which satisfies one condition.
   - But we also know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means supx(z) can be greater than infx(x). This doesn't guarantee the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - However, considering the locations, it's still possible for supx(z) to be less than infx(x). So let's analyze this specific scenario more carefully.
   
   Let's imagine a scenario where y is positioned such that its eastern part extends beyond the eastern boundary of z. If x is positioned in the easternmost part of y, then x could be situated to the east of z.
   
   Given:
   - y S z, meaning y is to the south of z with supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
   - x B y, meaning x is inside the bounding box of y.
   
   For x to be SE of z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   
   Is this possible? If y extends to the east beyond z's bounds, and x is positioned in the easternmost part of y, then it could be the case that supx(z) ≤ infx(x). 
   
   But wait, we know that supx(y) ≤ supx(z) from y S z, which means y doesn't extend beyond z in the x-direction. So supx(y) ≤ supx(z), and since x is inside y's bounding box, supx(x) ≤ supx(y). Therefore, supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   
   For x to be SE of z, we also need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But if supx(x) ≤ supx(z), it's unlikely that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (since infx(x) ≤ supx(x)).
   
   Actually, there's a subtlety here. If supx(x) equals infx(x), which could be the case if x is a line, then supx(z) ≤ infx(x) might be satisfied. However, the problem statement indicates that regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which means they don't collapse in the x or y dimensions. Therefore, for any region x, infx(x) < supx(x), which means it's not possible for supx(z) ≤ infx(x) if supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   
   Given that y doesn't extend beyond z in the x-direction and x is inside y's bounding box, it's not possible for x to be to the east or southeast of z.
   
   Therefore, x cannot be SE z.

After careful analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is S. That is, region x must be to the south of region z.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is S.

But let me reexamine the case of SE again just to be sure:

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Let's revisit the constraints we've derived:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

For the SE relation, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is satisfied. But for supx(z) ≤ infx(x), we have a contradiction with infx(z) ≤ infx(x). If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), then it's implying that part or all of x's x-coordinate range is to the right of or at the starting x-coordinate of z. For x to be to the southeast of z, it would need to be entirely to the right of z, which would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

But if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), it implies that at least part of region x has an x-coordinate that overlaps with the x-coordinate range of region z. This goes against the criteria for x to be SE of z.

Therefore, x cannot be SE of z.

In conclusion, the only possible relation between region x and region z based on the given conditions is S.

Hmm, wait a moment. I'm not fully convinced that SE is impossible. Let's reconsider.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y S z, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z.

For the SE relation, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

We've established supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so that condition is met.

But for supx(z) ≤ infx(x), we have a contradiction with infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). 

Here's my intuition: If region x is to be SE of region z, then x should be entirely to the right of and below z. But our given conditions only establish that x is below z. For x to be entirely to the right of z, we would need infx(x) ≥ supx(z). But our constraints say infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This doesn't guarantee infx(x) ≥ supx(z).

Actually, the constraints from x B y and y S z suggest that x and z can overlap in the x-direction (or at least, they're not guaranteed to be completely disjoint in the x-direction). This means that while x is definitely below z, it's not guaranteed to be to the southeast of z.

Therefore, the only guaranteed relation between x and z is S.

Let me now check to see if there are other possible scenarios that weren't entirely ruled out.

But actually, I need to be more careful. The derivation above was:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

This doesn't rule out all possible positions of x in relation to z. It just states that the leftmost point of x can't be to the left of the leftmost point of z, and the rightmost point of x can't be to the right of the rightmost point of z. But there's still flexibility within these constraints.

For example, the SE relation requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is satisfied. For supx(z) ≤ infx(x), we need the rightmost point of z to be to the left of the leftmost point of x.

Let's revisit the constraints again:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

For the SE relation, we need the rightmost point of z to be to the left of the leftmost point of x, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

But our constraints say infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z, and the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z. This doesn't definitively rule out or guarantee the SE relation, because the relative position of supx(z) and infx(x) isn't constrained by our given conditions.

Hmm, no. To be SE of z, the entirety of x needs to be to the right of and below z. This means that the leftmost point of x should be to the right of the rightmost point of z. But our constraints say the leftmost point of x (infx(x)) is to the right of the leftmost point of z (infx(z)), not necessarily to the right of the rightmost point of z (supx(z)). In fact, since supx(x) ≤ supx(z), it suggests that the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z, which again implies that x and z overlap in the x-direction.

So, the SE relation between x and z is not guaranteed by our constraints.

So far, we've confirmed that S is a possible relation between x and z, and we've ruled out the relations B, SW, W, NW, N, NE, and E. We've also discussed that the SE relation isn't guaranteed by our constraints, though I've been going back and forth on this. Let me try to resolve this once and for all.

For clarity, let's visualize a possible scenario:

```
   z
+-----+
|     |
+-----+
   |
   |
+-----+
|  y  |
+-----+
 |   |
 |   |
 +---+
  x  
```

In this depiction:
- y is S of z.
- x is B of y.
- The question is: what is the relationship between x and z?

Given the constraints, we know that x is below z (the top of x is below the bottom of z), and the x-coordinate range of x is within the x-coordinate range of z.

This definitively establishes that x is S of z.

Wait, just to be absolutely clear. The definition of SE is: a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).

For x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

We've established supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so that condition is met.

But for supx(z) ≤ infx(x), our constraints don't definitively ensure this. In fact, based on infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), it's more likely that the x-coordinate ranges of x and z overlap, which would preclude the SE relation.

Therefore, based on the constraints provided:
1. The only guaranteed relation between x and z is S.
2. The SE relation is not guaranteed, and is likely not possible.

Let me actually revisit the x SE z case. For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

Given our constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (the top of x is below the bottom of z)

From these, we know that x is in the south direction from z. For x to be SE of z, we would need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But our constraints give us infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which implies that x is within the x-projection of z.

Consider the extreme case where infx(x) = supx(x). This would mean x is a line (which doesn't fit our description of regions in REG). Even so, if infx(x) = supx(x) and given infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), we can't guarantee supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Therefore, the only guaranteed relation between x and z is S. The SE relation is not guaranteed based on the given constraints.

Let's very carefully recap: 
1. If x is B of y, then x is inside y's bounding box.
2. If y is S of z, then y is below z and the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z.

Given these, for any positioning of x and y that satisfies the first constraint, and any positioning of y and z that satisfies the second constraint, the relationship between x and z must be one of the 9 cardinal directions.

We've concluded that that relation is S, meaning x is to the south of z. Let me just triple check this is the only possible relation.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the leftmost point of x is to the right of or at the leftmost point of z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the rightmost point of x is to the left of or at the rightmost point of z)

Given the constraints derived from x B y and y S z:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

All three conditions for the S relation are met.

Now, we need to check if there's any scenario where x can have a different relation to z, still adhering to our constraints.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

While supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is satisfied by our constraints, the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) contradicts with supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which implies that the rightmost point of x is to the left of or at the rightmost point of z.

Looking back at the constraints:
- x B y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so x is below z.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

From this, it's clear that the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z, and the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z. This means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. Additionally, x is below z. This configuration precisely satisfies the definition of the S relation.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is S.

Actually, I realize that I'm overthinking this, and maybe including redundant statements. Let's just stick to the constraints that are necessary and sufficient to determine the relation:

Given:
- x B y: Region x is contained within the bounding box of region y.
- y S z: Region y is to the south of region z.

From the definitions:
- x B y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means the top of x is below the bottom of z.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), this constraint isn't quite right. In a more standard interpretation, from x B y, we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). From y S z, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z). So we get infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). This means the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z, and the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z.

Essentially, x is below z and the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.

According to the definition, a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a), and supx(a) ≤ supx(b). 

For x S z, we want supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). All of these are satisfied by our derived constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is S.

Actually, I'm realizing that I'm going around in circles. Let's see if there are any other possiblities, considering the various configurations that might satisfy our initial constraints.

The key relations are:
- x B y: Region x is contained within the bounding box of region y.
- y S z: Region y is to the south of region z.

Let's be a bit more structured in our approach. We'll consider each relation and see if it's consistent with our base constraints. I've already established that S is a possibility, but let me check the others again.

1. x B z: 
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which conflicts with infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So x can't be B z.

2. x S z: 
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - All of these are satisfied by our derived constraints. So x can be S z.

3. x SW z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which conflicts with supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So x can't be SW z.

4. x W z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which conflicts with infy(z) ≤ infy(x). Also, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which conflicts with supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So x can't be W z.

5. x NW z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z, contradicting the NW relation. So x can't be NW z.

6. x N z:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z, contradicting the N relation. So x can't be N z.

7. x NE z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z, contradicting the NE relation. So x can't be NE z.

8. x E z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which conflicts with infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So x can't be E z.

9. x SE z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But we've also derived that supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which with the traditional understanding of region closure, would imply that x's rightmost point is to the left of z's rightmost point. If x's rightmost point is to the left of z's rightmost point, then it can't be that z's rightmost point is to the left of x's leftmost point, which the SE relation requires.
   - So, based on our derived constraints, x can't be SE z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is S. That is, region x is to the south of region z.

Let me verify one more time:

For x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But for supx(z) ≤ infx(x) to be true, we need the rightmost point of z to be to the left of the leftmost point of x.

From our derived constraints, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Since infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infx(x) ≤ supx(x) (by definition), we have infx(z) ≤ supx(x).

Also, since supx(x) ≤ supx(z), we have infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

This means that the range [infx(z), supx(z)] and the range [infx(x), supx(x)] overlap, with the latter being contained within the former.

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But our derived constraints show that infx(x) is to the right of infx(z) and supx(x) is to the left of supx(z). This doesn't guarantee supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Therefore, x can't be guaranteed to be SE of z.

In conclusion, the relation between x and z is S. That is, region x is to the south of region z.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z based on the given conditions, I'll analyze what we know:

1. Region x is B of region y
   - This means x is inside y's bounding box
   - Formally: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

2. Region y is S of region z
   - This means y is south of z
   - Formally: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✓

All conditions for S are satisfied. Let's check if any other relations are possible:
- B: Impossible because supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts the requirement infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- SW, W, NW: Impossible because infx(z) ≤ infx(x) contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- N, NE, NW: Impossible because supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- E: Impossible because supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- SE: Impossible because supx(x) ≤ supx(z) contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

Therefore, the only possible relation is: S
