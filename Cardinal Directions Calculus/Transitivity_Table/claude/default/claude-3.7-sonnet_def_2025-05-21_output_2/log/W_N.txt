PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. We're given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is N of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's think about what these relations mean geometrically:

1. x is W of y means supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
   This means x is to the west of y: x is completely to the left of y, and vertically, x is within the range of y.

2. y is N of z means supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
   This means y is to the north of z: y is completely above z, and horizontally, y is within the range of z.

Now, let's try to determine where x could be in relation to z.

We know that:
- x is to the left of y
- y is above z

If we combine these, we can say that x is to the left of y, which is above z. But this still leaves multiple possibilities for the relation between x and z.

Let's consider the different cardinal directions and see which ones are possible:

1. N (North): Can x be directly north of z?
   For x to be north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x). Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x), which satisfies the first condition for N.
   We also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We know infx(z) <= infx(y), but since x is west of y, supx(x) <= infx(y). So it's not always true that infx(z) <= infx(x). Also, since x is to the left of y, it's not always true that supx(x) <= supx(z).
   So, N is not always a possible relation between x and z.

2. NE (North East): Can x be northeast of z?
   For x to be northeast of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   We already established that supy(z) <= infy(x). But since supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x is west of y) and infx(y) might be less than or equal to supx(z), we can't guarantee that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   So, NE is not always a possible relation between x and z.

3. E (East): Can x be east of z?
   For x to be east of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x is west of y) and supy(y) might be greater than supy(z), so we can't guarantee that supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, E is not always a possible relation between x and z.

4. SE (South East): Can x be southeast of z?
   For x to be southeast of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   We know infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x is west of y) and supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is north of z). Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x).
   But we also know supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x is west of y) and infy(y) might be greater than infy(z). So, we can't guarantee that supy(x) <= infy(z).
   So, SE is not always a possible relation between x and z.

5. S (South): Can x be south of z?
   For x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   As established before, we can't guarantee that supy(x) <= infy(z). Also, since supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x is west of y) and infx(y) might be less than or equal to supx(z), we can't guarantee that supx(x) <= supx(z).
   So, S is not always a possible relation between x and z.

6. SW (South West): Can x be southwest of z?
   For x to be southwest of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x is west of y) and infx(y) might be greater than or equal to infx(z), so we can't guarantee that supx(x) <= infx(z).
   Also, as established before, we can't guarantee that supy(x) <= infy(z).
   So, SW is not always a possible relation between x and z.

7. W (West): Can x be west of z?
   For x to be west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x is west of y) and infx(y) might be greater than or equal to infx(z), so we can't guarantee that supx(x) <= infx(z).
   So, W is not always a possible relation between x and z.

8. NW (North West): Can x be northwest of z?
   For x to be northwest of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x). But as before, we can't guarantee that supx(x) <= infx(z).
   So, NW is not always a possible relation between x and z.

9. B (Bounding box): Can x be within the bounding box of z?
   For x to be within the bounding box of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We've already established that some of these conditions might not be met.
   So, B is not always a possible relation between x and z.

It seems like I need to be more careful in my analysis. Let's reconsider and be more specific about the constraints.

1. x is W of y means:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is completely to the left of y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is at most as low as the bottom of y)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is at most as high as the top of y)

2. y is N of z means:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is completely above z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of y is at most as far left as the left boundary of z)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is at most as far right as the right boundary of z)

Given these, let's think about the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z:

1. N (North): For x to be north of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We know supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x). This satisfies the first condition.
   But we also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Since x is west of y, and y is north of z, we can't guarantee these conditions.

   So, N is a possible relation, but not always.

2. NE (North East): For x to be northeast of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)

   We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x). But for supx(z) <= infx(x), since x is west of y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y). From y being north of z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z). Combining these doesn't give us a clear relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).

   So, NE is not a possible relation.

3. E (East): For x to be east of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   Since supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= infx(y), we can't guarantee that supx(z) <= infx(x).

   So, E is not a possible relation.

4. SE (South East): For x to be southeast of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)

   Since supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), we can't establish a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

   So, SE is not a possible relation.

5. S (South): For x to be south of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   As mentioned earlier, we can't establish a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

   So, S is not a possible relation.

6. SW (South West): For x to be southwest of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   Given that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can have situations where supx(x) <= infx(z).
   But, as mentioned earlier, we can't establish a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

   So, SW is not a possible relation.

7. W (West): For x to be west of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   Given that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can have situations where supx(x) <= infx(z).
   We know infy(y) <= infy(x) and from the condition that y is north of z, we have supy(z) <= infy(y). Combining these doesn't give a clear relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).

   So, W is a possible relation, but not always.

8. NW (North West): For x to be northwest of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   Given that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can have situations where supx(x) <= infx(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x).

   So, NW is a possible relation, but not always.

9. B (Bounding box): For x to be within the bounding box of z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   Based on the conditions we've established, we can't guarantee all of these.

   So, B is not a possible relation.

I realize I'm having difficulty determining the exact possible relations. Let me approach this from a more visual perspective.

Given:
- x is W of y: x is completely to the left of y, with vertical boundaries of x within the vertical span of y.
- y is N of z: y is completely above z, with horizontal boundaries of y within the horizontal span of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- x is completely to the left of y.
- y is completely above z.
- Horizontally, x can be anywhere as long as it's to the left of y.
- Vertically, y can be anywhere as long as it's above z.

Given these constraints, x can be:
- NW of z: x is to the left of z and above z.
- W of z: x is to the left of z and at the same vertical level as z.
- SW of z: x is to the left of z and below z.
- N of z: x is directly above z.

Actually, the last one (N of z) is only valid if x and z have overlapping horizontal projections. Given that x is completely to the left of y, and y's horizontal span is within that of z, there can be situations where x is not horizontally overlapping with z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW
- W
- SW
- N

I think I've been overthinking this. Let's try once more.

1. Given that x is W of y, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is completely to the left of y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is at most as low as the bottom of y)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is at most as high as the top of y)

2. Given that y is N of z, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is completely above z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of y is at most as far left as the left boundary of z)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is at most as far right as the right boundary of z)

Let's check each possible direction.

1. N (North): For x to be north of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   We know:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) from (2)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) from (1)
   
   So, supy(z) <= infy(x), which is the first condition for N.
   The second condition, infx(z) <= infx(x), isn't guaranteed. Imagine if x is very far to the left, then infx(z) might be greater than infx(x).
   The third condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), isn't guaranteed either. Since supx(x) <= infx(y) from (1) and supx(y) <= supx(z) from (2), we can't establish a direct relation between supx(x) and supx(z).
   
   So, N is not always a possible relation.

2. NW (North West): For x to be northwest of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   For the first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) from (1)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) from (2)
   
   So, it's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z), but it's not guaranteed. This can happen if infx(z) < infx(y) and supx(x) < infx(z).
   
   So, NW is a possible relation, but not always.

3. W (West): For x to be west of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   As we established for NW, the first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), is possible but not guaranteed.
   
   For the second condition, infy(z) <= infy(x), we know:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) from (1)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) from (2)
   
   From these, we can't directly establish a relationship between infy(z) and infy(x). Imagine if infy(z) is very low, it might be below infy(x).
   
   For the third condition, supy(x) <= supy(z), we know:
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) from (1)
   
   But without knowing the relationship between supy(y) and supy(z), we can't guarantee that supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   So, W is a possible relation, but not always.

4. SW (South West): For x to be southwest of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   Just as for NW and W, the first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), is possible but not guaranteed.
   
   For the second condition, supy(x) <= infy(z), without knowing the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z), we can't guarantee this condition.
   
   So, SW is a possible relation, but not always.

5. S (South): For x to be south of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   As mentioned for SW, the first condition, supy(x) <= infy(z), isn't guaranteed.
   For the second and third conditions, just as for N, they aren't guaranteed either.
   
   So, S is a possible relation, but not always.

6. SE (South East): For x to be southeast of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   
   The first condition, as discussed, isn't guaranteed.
   For the second condition, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) from (1), which means infx(y) is to the right of x. From (2), we have supx(y) <= supx(z), which means supx(z) is to the right of y. Given these, it's impossible for supx(z) <= infx(x) (i.e., for supx(z) to be to the left of infx(x)).
   
   So, SE is not a possible relation.

7. E (East): For x to be east of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   As we determined for SE, the first condition isn't satisfied. So, E is not a possible relation.

8. NE (North East): For x to be northeast of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   
   The first condition is satisfied, as we established for N. But the second condition, as we established for SE, isn't satisfied.
   
   So, NE is not a possible relation.

9. B (Bounding box): For x to be within the bounding box of z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   We've already established that some of these conditions might not be met.
   
   So, B is not always a possible relation.

From the above analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West)
- W (West)
- SW (South West)
- S (South)
- N (North)

Wait, I think may still be making some mistakes. Let's reconsider:

1. If x is W of y, then:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the left of y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(y) (the vertical span of x is within the vertical span of y)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not higher than the top of y)

2. If y is N of z, then:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is entirely above z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(z) (the horizontal span of y is within the horizontal span of z)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is not further right than the right boundary of z)

Given these, let's check each possible relation between x and z.

Hmm, these constraints are still slightly incorrect. Let me correct them.

1. If x is W of y, then:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the left of y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of y)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not higher than the top of y)

2. If y is N of z, then:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is entirely above z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of y is not further left than the left boundary of z)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is not further right than the right boundary of z)

Now, let's check each possible relation.

1. N (North): For x to be north of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is not further left than the left boundary of z)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is not further right than the right boundary of z)
   
   From (1) and (2), we know:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from 1)
   
   So, supy(z) <= infy(x), which is the first condition for N.
   
   However, we can't directly establish the other two conditions from the given constraints. So, N is not always a possible relation.

2. NW (North West): For x to be northwest of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above z)
   
   We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   For the first condition, we know:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from 1)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (from 2)
   
   These don't directly give us supx(x) <= infx(z) without additional constraints. But it's a possible relation, especially if supx(x) is very far to the left.
   
   So, NW is a possible relation, though not always.

3. W (West): For x to be west of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of z)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not higher than the top of z)
   
   As for NW, the first condition isn't guaranteed always.
   
   For the second condition, we have:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from 1)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2)
   
   But these don't directly give us a relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).
   
   Similarly, for the third condition, we don't have a direct relationship.
   
   So, W is a possible relation, but not always.

4. SW (South West): For x to be southwest of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely below z)
   
   As established, the first condition isn't guaranteed always.
   
   For the second condition, we have:
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 1)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2)
   
   But these don't directly give us a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   
   So, SW is a possible relation, but not always.

5. S (South): For x to be south of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely below z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is not further left than the left boundary of z)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is not further right than the right boundary of z)
   
   As discussed for SW, the first condition isn't guaranteed.
   
   And just as for N, we can't directly establish the other two conditions from the given constraints.
   
   So, S is a possible relation, but not always.

6. SE (South East): For x to be southeast of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely below z)
   
   For the first condition:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from 1)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) (from 2)
   
   Combining these, we get supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which means supx(x) <= supx(z). But this doesn't guarantee that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   In fact, given that supx(x) <= infx(y) (from 1) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from 2), if infx(z) < infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(y) > infx(z). This makes x more to the left, which might not satisfy the first condition for SE.
   
   So, SE is not a possible relation.

7. E (East): For x to be east of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of z)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not higher than the top of z)
   
   As established for SE, the first condition isn't guaranteed.
   
   So, E is not a possible relation.

8. NE (North East): For x to be northeast of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above z)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z)
   
   We've established that the first condition is satisfied, but the second condition is not guaranteed.
   
   So, NE is not a possible relation.

9. B (Bounding box): For x to be within the bounding box of z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is not further left than the left boundary of z)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is not further right than the right boundary of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of z)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not higher than the top of z)
   
   As we've established, several of these conditions aren't guaranteed.
   
   So, B is not always a possible relation.

From the above analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West)
- W (West)
- SW (South West)
- S (South)
- N (North)

Alright, let me validate this again by visualizing the constraints and checking the relations.

1. x is W of y: This means x is entirely to the left of y, and the vertical span of x is within the vertical span of y.
2. y is N of z: This means y is entirely above z, and the horizontal span of y is within the horizontal span of z.

From these constraints, where can x be in relation to z?

If x is entirely to the left of y, and y is entirely above z, then x can be:
- To the left of z and above z: This is NW.
- Directly to the left of z: This is W.
- To the left of z and below z: This is SW.
- Directly above z: This is N.
- Below z: This is S.

But the fifth option (S) requires that x is below z, which is not guaranteed from the given constraints. In fact, from the constraint that x is W of y, the vertical span of x is within the vertical span of y. And from the constraint that y is N of z, y is entirely above z. This would place the bottom of x above the top of z, making it impossible for x to be completely below z.

Actually, let's revisit the exact definition:
- x is W of y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

So x is W of y means x is entirely to the left of y, the bottom of x is at most as low as the bottom of y, and the top of x is at most as high as the top of y.

And y is N of z means y is entirely above z, the left boundary of y is at most as far left as the left boundary of z, and the right boundary of y is at most as far right as the right boundary of z.

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of y, and the bottom of x is at most as low as the bottom of y. This means the top of z is below the bottom of x, making it impossible for x to be S of z.

Let's reconsider the possible relations:

1. N (North): For x to be north of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is not further left than the left boundary of z)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is not further right than the right boundary of z)
   
   We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x), so the first condition is satisfied.
   
   The second condition requires infx(z) <= infx(x). We know:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x is W of y)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is N of z)
   
   But these don't directly give us a relationship between infx(z) and infx(x). If infx(z) < infx(x), then the condition is satisfied. But if infx(z) > infx(x), then the condition is not satisfied.
   
   The third condition requires supx(x) <= supx(z). We know:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x is W of y)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is N of z)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y is N of z)
   
   From these, we can derive:
   supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
   Thus, supx(x) <= supx(z), which satisfies the third condition.
   
   Since the second condition isn't guaranteed, N is a possible relation but not always.

2. NW (North West): For x to be northwest of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above z)
   
   We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x), so the second condition is satisfied.
   
   For the first condition, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x is W of y)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is N of z)
   
   If infx(z) < infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(y) doesn't guarantee supx(x) <= infx(z). But if infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(z), which satisfies the first condition.
   
   So, NW is a possible relation, but not always.

3. W (West): For x to be west of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of z)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not higher than the top of z)
   
   As established for NW, the first condition isn't guaranteed.
   
   For the second condition, we have:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x is W of y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is N of z)
   
   From these, we can derive:
   supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
   Since supy(z) <= infy(x), we know that the top of z is below the bottom of x. Given that regions in REG are connected, this means it's impossible for the bottom of z to be below the bottom of x. In other words, it's impossible for infy(z) <= infy(x). This violates the second condition for W.
   
   So, W is not a possible relation.

4. SW (South West): For x to be southwest of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely below z)
   
   As established for NW, the first condition isn't guaranteed.
   
   For the second condition, we have:
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x is W of y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is N of z)
   
   From these, we can derive:
   supy(x) <= supy(y), supy(z) <= infy(y)
   Given that regions in REG are connected, and y and z are separate regions, we know that supy(y) is less than supy(z). Combined with supy(x) <= supy(y), we get supy(x) <= supy(y) < supy(z). This means the top of x is below the top of z. But for SW, we need the top of x to be below the bottom of z, which isn't guaranteed.
   
   So, SW is not a possible relation.

5. S (South): For x to be south of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely below z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is not further left than the left boundary of z)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is not further right than the right boundary of z)
   
   As discussed for SW, the first condition isn't guaranteed. In fact, given that the top of z is below the bottom of y, and the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of y, it's impossible for x to be entirely below z.
   
   So, S is not a possible relation.

6. SE, E, NE, B: As established earlier, these are not possible relations.

Revising our conclusions, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West)
- N (North)

Actually, I need to reconsider the W relation. I think I made an error in my analysis.

For a region x to be W of region z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not higher than the top of z)

I said it's impossible for infy(z) <= infy(x) because supy(z) <= infy(x), which would mean the top of z is below the bottom of x. But this logic assumes that z is "above" x, which isn't necessarily the case. If z is "below" x, then infy(z) can indeed be less than or equal to infy(x).

Given this correction, let's reconsider the W relation.

For the third condition, we need supy(x) <= supy(z). We know:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x is W of y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is N of z)

Combining these:
supy(x) <= supy(y), supy(z) <= infy(y)

But these don't directly relate supy(x) and supy(z). If supy(x) < supy(z), then the condition is satisfied. But if supy(x) > supy(z), then the condition is not satisfied.

So, W is a possible relation, but not always.

Similarly, let's revise our analysis for SW.

For a region x to be SW of region z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely below z)

For the second condition, we have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x is W of y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is N of z)

Combining these, we can't directly determine if supy(x) <= infy(z). It's possible, but not guaranteed.

So, SW is a possible relation, but not always.

And for completeness, let's also reconsider S.

For a region x to be S of region z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is not further left than the left boundary of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is not further right than the right boundary of z)

As discussed for SW, the first condition is not guaranteed.

For the second condition, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x is W of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is N of z)

Combining these, we can't directly determine if infx(z) <= infx(x). It's possible, but not guaranteed.

The third condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), was already established earlier.

So, S is a possible relation, but not always.

Revising our final conclusions, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West)
- N (North)
- W (West)
- SW (South West)
- S (South)

Actually, I think there's still an issue here. If x is W of y, then the x region must be entirely to the left of y (not just the top-left, right-left, etc.). And if y is N of z, then y must be entirely above z. Given these constraints:

1. The x region is entirely to the left of y.
2. The y region is entirely above z.

Where can x be in relation to z? Since x is to the left of y, and y is above z, x can be:
- To the west-northwest of z.
- To the northwest of z.
- To the north-northwest of z.
- To the west of z.
- To the southwest of z.

But for the precise directions in the problem:

- NW (North West): For this, x should be to the left of z and above z. Given that the top of z is below the bottom of y, and x has a vertical extent that doesn't go below the bottom of y, x is very likely above z. And since x is to the left of y, which is constrained to the horizontal span of z, x can be to the left of z. So, NW is a possible relation.

- N (North): For this, x should be directly above z (with some horizontal overlap). Given that x is to the left of y, and y is constrained to the horizontal span of z, there might be cases where x still horizontally overlaps with z. So, N is a possible relation.

- W (West): For this, x should be directly to the left of z (with some vertical overlap). Since x is to the left of y, and the bottom of x doesn't go below the bottom of y, and the top of z is below the bottom of y, there might be a scenario where x and z vertically overlap. So, W is a possible relation.

- SW (South West): For this, x should be to the left of z and below z. Given that the top of z is below the bottom of y, and x has a vertical extent that doesn't go below the bottom of y, it's unlikely for x to be below z. But if the vertical extents allow, it could be a possible relation.

- S (South): For this, x should be directly below z. Given the constraints, it seems unlikely for x to be below z. But again, if the vertical extents allow, it could be a possible relation.

- NE, E, SE, B: Given that x is to the left of y, which is constrained to the horizontal span of z, these relations (which would place x to the right of z or within z) are not possible.

So, revising again, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West)
- N (North)
- W (West)

Actually, I think I've been mixing up the constraints. Let's restate them more precisely:

For a region x to be W of region y, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): This means x is entirely to the left of y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x): This means the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of y.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): This means the top of x is not higher than the top of y.

For a region y to be N of region z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(y): This means y is entirely above z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y): This means the left boundary of y is not further left than the left boundary of z.
- supx(y) <= supx(z): This means the right boundary of y is not further right than the right boundary of z.

I think the constraint infy(y) <= infy(x) for W means that the bottom of x is at most as low as the bottom of y, not that the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of y. So, if the bottom of y is at a height of h, then the bottom of x is at most at a height of h, which means x can be below y.

Given this correction, x can be in various positions relative to z. And I believe the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West)
- N (North)
- W (West)
- SW (South West)
- S (South)

Actually, one more clarification: I mistook the constraint infy(y) <= infy(x). It should be "the bottom of x is not *higher* than the bottom of y." So the bottom of x can indeed be below the bottom of y. Given this, my previous analysis is correct.

So, the final list of possible relations between x and z is:
- NW (North West)
- N (North)
- W (West)
- SW (South West)
- S (South)

ANSWER:

The question asks for possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z given that x is W of y and y is N of z.

Let me analyze what these constraints mean:

When x is W of y:
- x is completely to the left of y
- The vertical extent of x is within the vertical range of y

When y is N of z:
- y is completely above z
- The horizontal extent of y is within the horizontal range of z

From these constraints, I need to determine where x could be in relation to z.

The possible relations are:

- NW (North West): x can be to the left and above z
- W (West): x can be directly to the left of z with vertical overlap
- SW (South West): x can be to the left and below z
- N (North): x can be directly above z with horizontal overlap
- S (South): x can be directly below z with horizontal overlap
