PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We know:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

Let's recall the definitions for these relations:

SW relation: x SW y if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
This means x is entirely to the southwest of y. Specifically:
- x is entirely to the west of y: the eastmost point of x is west of the westmost point of y
- x is entirely to the south of y: the northmost point of x is south of the southmost point of y

NW relation: y NW z if and only if supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
This means y is entirely to the northwest of z. Specifically:
- y is entirely to the west of z: the eastmost point of y is west of the westmost point of z
- y is entirely to the north of z: the southmost point of y is north of the northmost point of z

Now, let's try to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Given x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

Given y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  This implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is west of z.

For the north-south relationship, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y)

But this doesn't tell us directly whether x is north or south of z, or whether they overlap in the y-axis. We only know both x and z are south of y, but their relative positions to each other in the y-axis is not immediately clear from the given constraints.

Let's think about this geometrically. If x is SW of y, and y is NW of z, then x is certainly to the west of both y and z. But in terms of north-south positioning, x is south of y, and z is south of y, but the relationship between x and z is not fixed.

Specifically:
- x could be south of z: in this case, x would be SW of z.
- x could be at the same north-south level as z: in this case, x would be W of z.
- x could be north of z: in this case, x would be NW of z.

So the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, or NW.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning by drawing a small diagram.

If x is SW of y:
- x is to the west and south of y
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

If y is NW of z:
- y is to the west and north of z
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's work through these constraints:
From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can infer:
supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
This means x is to the west of z (the eastmost point of x is west of the westmost point of z).

From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), we can't infer a direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z).

This confirms our earlier conclusion: x could be SW, W, or NW of z.

Let's actually include a more careful visualization. Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Since y is NW of z, y could be at, for example, (-2, 2). Since x is SW of y, x could be at several positions:
- x at (-3, 1): Here, x would be NW of z.
- x at (-3, 0): Here, x would be W of z.
- x at (-3, -1): Here, x would be SW of z.

Hmm, there's something off about my examples, because I haven't respected the constraints properly. Let me recheck.

For y to be NW of z, I should have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z): The eastmost point of y should be west of the westmost point of z.
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y): The northmost point of z should be south of the southmost point of y.

For x to be SW of y, I should have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y): The eastmost point of x should be west of the westmost point of y.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y): The northmost point of x should be south of the southmost point of y.

Now, for z at the origin (0, 0), if infx(z) = 0 (the westmost point of z is at the origin), then supx(y) ≤ 0 (the eastmost point of y is at or to the west of the origin). Let's say y spans from (-3, 2) to (-1, 4), which makes supx(y) = -1 and infy(y) = 2.

Given these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = -3: The eastmost point of x is at or to the west of -3.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) = 2: The northmost point of x is at or to the south of 2.

Let's place x at various positions and see the relation with z:

1. x spans from (-5, 0) to (-4, 1):
   - supx(x) = -4, which is ≤ infx(z) = 0, so x is west of z.
   - supy(x) = 1, which might be ≤, =, or > supy(z) depending on where the northmost part of z is. If we assume z spans from (0, 0) to (2, 1), then supy(z) = 1, and x and z are at the same north-south level, making x W of z.

2. x spans from (-5, -2) to (-4, -1):
   - supx(x) = -4, which is ≤ infx(z) = 0, so x is west of z.
   - supy(x) = -1, which is < infy(z) = 0, so x is south of z, making x SW of z.

3. x spans from (-5, 1) to (-4, 2):
   - supx(x) = -4, which is ≤ infx(z) = 0, so x is west of z.
   - infy(x) = 1, which is > supy(z) = 1, so x is north of z, making x NW of z.

This confirms that x could be SW, W, or NW of z.

Actually, let's consider the case where x and z could overlap in the y-axis. Suppose:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (2, 2)
- y spans from (-3, 3) to (-1, 5)

For x, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = -3
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) = 3

Let's place x so it spans from (-5, 1) to (-4, 4):
- supx(x) = -4, which is ≤ infx(z) = 0, so x is west of z.
- infy(x) = 1, which is > infy(z) = 0, and supy(x) = 4, which is > supy(z) = 2. This means x spans the entire north-south extent of z and then some. In this case, x is W of z.

Wait, let me check the definition of the W relation again:
a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

For x to be W of z, we would need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): The eastmost point of x is west of the westmost point of z. (This is satisfied.)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x): The southmost point of z is south of or at the same level as the southmost point of x. (This isn't satisfied in our example because infy(x) = 1 > infy(z) = 0.)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z): The northmost point of x is south of or at the same level as the northmost point of z. (This isn't satisfied in our example because supy(x) = 4 > supy(z) = 2.)

So, actually x wouldn't be W of z in our example. It would be a different relation, possibly involving multiple tiles.

Let me redefine our scenario:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (2, 2)
- y spans from (-3, 3) to (-1, 5)
- x spans from (-5, 0) to (-4, 2)

With these dimensions:
- x is west of z because supx(x) = -4 < infx(z) = 0.
- x and z are at the same north-south level because infy(x) = infy(z) = 0 and supy(x) = supy(z) = 2.

So, in this case, x is W of z.

Actually, our initial analysis was correct. The possible relations between x and z are SW, W, or NW.

But let's see if there are any other possibilities I might have overlooked.

If x is SW of y and y is NW of z, then:
- x is west of y
- x is south of y
- y is west of z
- y is north of z

From these, we can infer:
- x is west of z (through transitivity of the west relation)
- The north-south relationship between x and z is not fixed.

Let's consider the north-south possibilities:
1. x is south of z: x is SW of z.
2. x overlaps with z in the north-south direction according to the constraints of the W relation: x is W of z.
3. x is north of z: x is NW of z.

It seems like our initial conclusion is complete: x could be SW, W, or NW of z.

Wait, actually there might be more possibilities. Let's revisit the definitions of the relations and ensure our reasoning is correct.

From x SW y and y NW z, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)

From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can infer: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is west of z.

Now, for the north-south relationship, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y)

This means both x and z are south of y. However, this doesn't fix the relationship between x and z in the north-south axis.

Scenario 1: infy(x) > supy(z) (The southmost point of x is north of the northmost point of z)
In this case, x is north of z. Combined with x being west of z, we get x NW z.

Scenario 2: Some overlap in the north-south axis
Depending on the overlap:
- If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x W z.
- Otherwise, we'd have a more complex multi-tile relation.

Scenario 3: supy(x) < infy(z) (The northmost point of x is south of the southmost point of z)
In this case, x is south of z. Combined with x being west of z, we get x SW z.

Looking at the complicated case from Scenario 2 more closely:
- If infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z), then x both extends south of z and north of z, while being west. This would be a multi-tile relation, specifically x W:SW:NW z.
- If infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x extends south of z while being west. This would be x W:SW z.
- If infy(x) ≥ infy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z), then x extends north of z while being west. This would be x W:NW z.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- x NW z
- x W z
- x SW z
- x W:NW z
- x W:SW z
- x W:SW:NW z

Actually, I'm reading through the problem description at the top of the discussion, and I don't think we can have W:NW, W:SW, or W:SW:NW. The description says a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where the a_i belongs to R_i(b) and a_1 union ... union a_k belongs to REG. In other words, the primary region can be divided into parts such that each part has a single-tile relation with the reference region. 

So actually, let me try to think about what's going on more clearly. We want the relations R such that we can have x R z.

Let's now examine the possible regions for x, y, z more quantitatively to determine the potential relationships.

Given:
- x SW y (x is southwest of y)
- y NW z (y is northwest of z)

Let's place z at (0, 0) with dimensions 2x2, so z spans from (0, 0) to (2, 2).

For y to be NW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)

This gives us:
- supx(y) ≤ 0
- 2 ≤ infy(y)

Let's place y at (-3, 3) with dimensions 2x2, so y spans from (-3, 3) to (-1, 5).

For x to be SW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

This gives us:
- supx(x) ≤ -3
- supy(x) ≤ 3

Now, let's explore different positions for x and determine its relation with z.

Case 1: x spans from (-6, -2) to (-4, 0).
- supx(x) = -4 ≤ infx(z) = 0, so x is west of z.
- supy(x) = 0 ≤ infy(z) = 0, so x is not north of z.
- supy(x) = 0 < supy(z) = 2, so x can overlap with z in the north-south direction.
- infy(x) = -2 < infy(z) = 0, so x extends south of z.
Given these, x has a W:SW relation with z.

Actually, you know what, this is getting quite complicated. Let me try to simplify. I'll set up a specific scenario with specific values for the regions, then determine the relation.

Let z be at (0, 0) with dimensions 2x2, so z spans from (0, 0) to (2, 2).

Let y be at (-3, 3) with dimensions 2x2, so y spans from (-3, 3) to (-1, 5).

For x, let's define specific cases:

Case 1: x spans from (-6, -2) to (-4, 0).
Here, x is entirely west of z (supx(x) = -4 < infx(z) = 0), and x is entirely south of z (supy(x) = 0, which is the northmost point of x, is at the same level as infy(z) = 0, which is the southmost point of z). In this case, x SW z.

Case 2: x spans from (-6, 0) to (-4, 2).
Here, x is entirely west of z (supx(x) = -4 < infx(z) = 0), and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction (infy(x) = 0 = infy(z) and supy(x) = 2 = supy(z)). In this case, x W z.

Case 3: x spans from (-6, 1) to (-4, 3).
Here, x is entirely west of z (supx(x) = -4 < infx(z) = 0), and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction but also extends north of z (infy(x) = 1 > infy(z) = 0 and supy(x) = 3 > supy(z) = 2). From the definition of the W relation, for x W z, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which is true: 0 ≤ 1) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (which is not true: 3 > 2). So, this isn't a straightforward W relation.

Actually, when we analyze this case, it fits the definition of multiple tiles. The region x can be split into two parts: the portion that aligns with z in the north-south direction (which has a W relation) and the portion that extends north of z (which has a NW relation).

So, in this case, x has a W:NW relation with z, or more precisely we'd need to split x into two portions, left to right, one having a W relation with z and the other having a NW relation.

Case 4: x spans from (-6, 2) to (-4, 4).
Here, x is entirely west of z (supx(x) = -4 < infx(z) = 0), and x is entirely north of z (infy(x) = 2 > supy(z) = 2). In this case, x NW z.

Let's build a full case analysis.

Actually, let me rethink this through. The problem is asking for the possible relation between x and z, and it's not asking me to give a specific example. So I should be methodical in identifying all possible relations. Let's place ourselves in a coordinate system and use the given constraints.

Given:
- x SW y
- y NW z

From the definitions:
- x SW y implies supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y NW z implies supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we get:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is entirely to the west of z.

For the north-south relationship, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

This implies that both x and z are south of y (in terms of their northmost points). But we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z).

So, in terms of the north-south relationship, the following scenarios are possible:
1. x is entirely north of z: infy(x) > supy(z)
2. x overlaps with z in the north-south direction: either infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) > infy(z), or infy(z) < infy(x) < supy(z)
3. x is entirely south of z: supy(x) < infy(z)

Let's see how these scenarios, combined with the fact that x is west of z, map to the cardinal directions:

Scenario 1: x is entirely west of z and entirely north of z. This is the NW relation, so x NW z.

Scenario 2: x is entirely west of z and overlaps with z in the north-south direction. This can be further broken down:
2a. x is entirely west of z, and the south-north extent of x contains the south-north extent of z. This is the W relation, so x W z.
2b. x is entirely west of z, and the south-north extent of x partially overlaps with the south-north extent of z, with x extending north beyond z. This isn't a single-tile relation, but rather a multi-tile W:NW relation.
2c. x is entirely west of z, and the south-north extent of x partially overlaps with the south-north extent of z, with x extending south beyond z. This is a multi-tile W:SW relation.
2d. x is entirely west of z, and the south-north extent of x extends both north and south beyond z. This is a multi-tile W:NW:SW relation.

Scenario 3: x is entirely west of z and entirely south of z. This is the SW relation, so x SW z.

But I need to be very careful about the multi-tile relations. I know from the problem description that a region can be in a multi-tile relation to another region, but I need to check whether the specific multi-tile relations I've listed are valid.

Let me think about this more. A multi-tile relation requires the primary region (in this case, x) to be divided into parts, each of which has a single-tile relation with the reference region (z). The union of these parts should be homeomorphic to the closed unit disk (the definition of REG in the problem).

For instance, let me draw out the constraints for a region x to have a W:NW relation with a region z.
To be a W:NW relation, I'd need a region a_1 in W(z) and a region a_2 in NW(z).  In one of the examples I provided earlier, we can have x such that parts of it satisfy x W z and other parts satisfy x NW z. The valid multiregion relation, then, would be W:NW. Let's check similarly for the others.

W:SW and W:NW:SW can be justified in a similar manner. The region x can be shaped such that parts of it satisfy different relations with z, and the union of these parts is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk.

So, given the constraints "x SW y and y NW z", the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NW z
- x W z
- x SW z
- x W:NW z
- x W:SW z
- x W:NW:SW z

Let me double check if these are all the possible relations, or if there are any other possibilities.

Given:
- x SW y
- y NW z

We've established that x is west of z. So, x can only have relations that involve being west of z, which are: NW, W, SW, and combinations of these.

I think I've covered all possible combinations of these relations, so the answer is:
- x NW z
- x W z
- x SW z
- x W:NW z
- x W:SW z
- x W:NW:SW z

Actually, wait, I think there's a subtle issue with W:NW:SW. Let's think about it: this would mean x is partitioned into 3 regions, one where x W z, one where x NW z, and one where x SW z. But that would imply a disconnected region, which might violate the condition that regions in REG are connected. 

But actually, it's possible for x to be partitioned into these three regions and still be connected. For example, the middle part could be a region where x W z, the top part could be a region where x NW z, and the bottom part could be a region where x SW z. This would be a connected region.

Actually, I'm misinterpreting something. Let's visit the definition again. We're told that a cardinal direction relation R1:…:Rk is valid if "there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

For the W:NW:SW relation, we'd have:
- a1 belongs to W(z)
- a2 belongs to NW(z)
- a3 belongs to SW(z)
- a1 union a2 union a3 belongs to REG

That is, the union of these three regions (which individually satisfy the W, NW, and SW relations) must be homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This typically would be a connected region.

So, the relation W:NW:SW is valid.

Let's summarize the possible relations between regions x and z, given that x is SW of y and y is NW of z:
- x NW z
- x W z
- x SW z
- x W:NW z
- x W:SW z
- x W:NW:SW z

However, there's a subtle issue I'm still unsure about. The problem is asking for the "possible relations between region x and region z," not what region x could be relative to z. My concern is that I'm not fully considering all the relations in the framework. Let me reread the problem statement and the given framework.

Actually, the problem is asking for the "possible relations" between regions x and z. That is, which cardinal direction relations can arise between them. I've identified the relations correctly. However, it's important to ensure that the multi-tile relations I've listed are valid within the framework.

From the problem description: a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where:
1. 1 <= k <= 9,
2. R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE},
3. Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j,
4. there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

I've checked that the relations NW, W, SW, W:NW, W:SW, and W:NW:SW all satisfy these conditions. So, the possible relations between regions x and z, given that x is SW of y and y is NW of z, are:
- x NW z
- x W z
- x SW z
- x W:NW z
- x W:SW z
- x W:NW:SW z

Ah, I just realized another condition that I'm not considering. The problem stated "A cardinal direction relation R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

Condition iv) says that the union of regions a1, ..., ak must belong to REG. Let's ensure that the multi-tile relations I've listed satisfy this. Actually, I think this is just saying that the union of the tiled regions has to be a valid region as defined by the problem statement. So I think we're good.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z, given that x is SW of y and y is NW of z, are:
- x NW z
- x W z
- x SW z
- x W:NW z
- x W:SW z
- x W:NW:SW z

But wait, I want to make sure I'm not missing any possibilities for multi-tile relations. Let's think about it again.

Given:
- x SW y
- y NW z

We've established that x is west of z. So, x can only have relations that involve being west of z, which are: NW, W, SW, and combinations of these.

The possible combinations are:
- NW, W, SW (individually)
- NW:W, W:SW, NW:SW, NW:W:SW

But I need to ensure that these combinations are valid within the framework. For a combination to be valid, the regions corresponding to the individual relations must be union-able to form a region in REG (a region homeomorphic to the closed unit disk).

NW:W is valid because I can have a region that has a part satisfying NW(z) and another part satisfying W(z), and the union can be constructed to be homeomorphic to the closed unit disk.

W:SW is valid for a similar reason.

NW:SW seems less intuitive. If one part of x is NW of z and another part is SW of z, then there's a disjoint with respect to the north-south axis. You'd have one part of x that's north of z and another part that's south of z. The union of these might not be connected.

Actually, that's not true. The regions in REG need to be connected, but that doesn't mean we can't have a region with a part in NW(z) and another part in SW(z). For instance, picture a "C" shaped region to the west of z, wrapping around z on the north and south sides. This would be a connected region, with parts in NW(z) and SW(z).

So, NW:SW is also a valid combination.

NW:W:SW is valid if I can have a region with parts in NW(z), W(z), and SW(z), and the union is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. As I've discussed, this is possible.

Finally, I've confirmed that all the combinations I listed earlier are valid within the framework, and that those are all the allowed combinations given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z, given that x is SW of y and y is NW of z, are:
- x NW z
- x W z
- x SW z
- x W:NW z
- x W:SW z
- x NW:SW z
- x W:NW:SW z

Actually, I made a mistake. I overlooked NW:SW as valid combination. Let me correct the list of possible relations between regions x and z, given that x is SW of y and y is NW of z:

- x NW z
- x W z
- x SW z
- x W:NW z
- x W:SW z
- x NW:SW z
- x W:NW:SW z

But I want to double check if NW:SW is actually valid. If x is NW of z, then x is north of z. If x is SW of z, then x is south of z. Can a single, connected region be both north and south of another region?

Actually, yes, it's possible. Picture a "C" shaped region to the west of z, with the top part of the "C" in NW(z) and the bottom part in SW(z). This would be a connected region with parts in NW(z) and SW(z).

However, this "C" shaped region would also have parts in W(z), making the relation W:NW:SW, not just NW:SW.

Hmm, actually that's an important observation. My reasoning was flawed for NW:SW. If a region is both NW and SW of another, then it must also have a part that's strictly W of the other. A "C" shaped region would have parts in NW(z), W(z), and SW(z).

So, NW:SW is not a valid combination on its own. It would necessarily include W, making it W:NW:SW.

With this correction, the possible relations between regions x and z, given that x is SW of y and y is NW of z, are:
- x NW z
- x W z
- x SW z
- x W:NW z
- x W:SW z
- x W:NW:SW z

This seems to be the correct and complete list.

Now that I think more about the way the problem was phrased, I think we are supposed to list every single possible (not composite) relation (like in part ii) in the cardinal direction section), not all the composites.
But actually, the question just asks which relations are possible, and these composite relations are valid cardinal direction relations based on the definition. And we've been asked to list the relations between regions x and z.

Actually, let me make sure. The problem states "possible relations between region x and region z," and it asks for a cardinal directional relation in the form R1:...:Rk. So the composite relations are indeed valid answers.

Actually, I think the issue is that I'm overthinking the problem. The problem is asking for the possible relations between regions x and z, where a relation is one of the cardinal direction relations (either single-tile or multi-tile).

So the answer is:
- x NW z
- x W z
- x SW z
- x W:NW z
- x W:SW z
- x W:NW:SW z

Given the constraints "x SW y and y NW z", these are all the possible relations between regions x and z.

ANSWER:

Given:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these constraints:

1. For the east-west relationship:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which implies x is west of z

2. For the north-south relationship:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - This means both x and z are south of y, but their north-south relationship with each other is not fixed

Possible relations:
- NW (if x is north of z)
- W (if x and z overlap in the north-south direction according to W relation constraints)
- SW (if x is south of z)
- W:NW (if x extends north of z while being west)
- W:SW (if x extends south of z while being west)
- W:NW:SW (if x extends both north and south of z while being west)
