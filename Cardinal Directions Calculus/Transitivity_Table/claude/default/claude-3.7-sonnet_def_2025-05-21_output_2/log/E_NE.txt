PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step using the definitions of cardinal directions given.

We have:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Let's first understand what these relations mean based on the given definitions:

x E y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's lower bound in y is at least as high as y's lower bound)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's upper bound in y is at most as high as y's upper bound)

y NE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, let's try to determine the possible relation between x and z.

First, let's consider the east-west relationship:
- From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y NE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y)
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- This means x is to the east of z, so x has some form of eastern relation to z (E, NE, or SE)

Now, let's consider the north-south relationship:
- From x E y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y NE z, we know supy(z) <= infy(y)
- By transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This means x is to the north of z, so x has some form of northern relation to z (N, NE, or NW)

Combining these constraints:
- x is both to the east and north of z

The only cardinal direction that satisfies both of these constraints is NE. Therefore, x is NE of z.

Actually, let me verify this one more time to be sure.

From x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's lower bound in y is at least as high as y's lower bound)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's upper bound in y is at most as high as y's upper bound)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

For the east-west relationship between x and z:
- From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y NE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y)
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- This means x is to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship between x and z:
- From x E y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y NE z, we know supy(z) <= infy(y)
- By transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This means x is to the north of z.

Wait, I think I'm too quickly converging on a conclusion.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's combine these to understand the relationship between x and z.

For the east-west relationship:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y NE z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is east of z.

For the north-south relationship:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)
- Comparing supy(z) with infy(x), we have two scenarios:
  1. If infy(x) >= infy(y), then supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), meaning x is north of z.
  2. If infy(x) < infy(y), we don't know the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).

From x E y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x), which is the opposite of scenario 2. So, we're in scenario 1: supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is north of z.

Combining these, x is both east and north of z, which means x is NE of z.

Hold on, I'm making an error again. Let me be more careful. 

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

The east-west relationship is clear:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y NE z)
- infx(y) <= supx(y) (by definition of infimum and supremum)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.

The north-south relationship is a bit trickier:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y)
- By transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

So, x is both to the east and north of z. Therefore, x is NE of z.

Actually, I'm being too hasty again. Let me reconsider what these relations mean:

x E y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of y's y-coordinates)

y NE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

For the east-west relationship between x and z:
- From y NE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y)
- From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x)
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- This means x is to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship between x and z:
- From y NE z, we know supy(z) <= infy(y)
- From x E y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x)
- By transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This means x is to the north of z.

So, x is both to the east and north of z.

Based on the cardinal direction relations, if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then the relation is one of the following: NE, N, or E.

Actually, I'm confusing myself. Let me go back to the basic definitions and reason carefully.

A region a is NE of a region b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the north of b)

A region a is N of a region b if and only if:
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the north of b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) (a's x-coordinates are within the range of b's x-coordinates)

A region a is E of a region b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a's y-coordinates are within the range of b's y-coordinates)

Now, let's analyze what we know about the relationship between x and z.

For the east-west relationship:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)

For the north-south relationship:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

Based on the definitions, these constraints suggest that x is NE of z. 

Wait, I'm still not considering all possibilities. Let me think more carefully.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of y's y-coordinates)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

For the east-west relationship between x and z:
- From y NE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y)
- From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x)
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- This means x is to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship between x and z:
- From y NE z, we know supy(z) <= infy(y)
- From x E y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- By transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This means x is to the north of z.

So, x is both to the east and north of z.

Now, based on the constraints supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NE, E, and N.

But there's more to consider. Let's go deeper:

For x to be NE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) ✓
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z) ✓

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) ✓
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of z's y-coordinates) ?

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z) ✓
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within the range of z's x-coordinates) ?

Hmm, I'm still not confident in my conclusion. Let me consider a simple example to clarify.

Let's place the regions in a Cartesian plane:
- Region z is a unit square with lower-left corner at (0, 0) and upper-right corner at (1, 1).
- Region y is a unit square with lower-left corner at (2, 2) and upper-right corner at (3, 3). This makes y NE of z.
- Region x is a unit square with lower-left corner at (4, 2) and upper-right corner at (5, 3). This makes x E of y.

With these coordinates, we have:
- For z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1
- For y: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 3
- For x: infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3

Check y NE z:
- supx(z) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2 ✓
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 ✓

Check x E y:
- supx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4 ✓
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2 ✓
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 3 ✓

Now, let's check the relations between x and z:
- supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 4 ✓ (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2 ✓ (x is to the north of z)
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 2 ✓ (part of the E constraint, but not enough)
- supy(x) = 3 > supy(z) = 1 ✗ (x's upper bound is higher than z's, contradicting the E relation)
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 4 ✓ (part of the N constraint)
- supx(x) = 5 <= supx(z) = 1 ✗ (x's right bound is to the right of z's, contradicting the N relation)

In this example, x is NE of z, but not E or N.

But let me try another example:
- Region z is a unit square with lower-left corner at (0, 0) and upper-right corner at (10, 1).
- Region y is a unit square with lower-left corner at (11, 2) and upper-right corner at (12, 3). This makes y NE of z.
- Region x is a unit square with lower-left corner at (13, 2) and upper-right corner at (14, 3). This makes x E of y.

With these coordinates, we have:
- For z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1
- For y: infx(y) = 11, supx(y) = 12, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 3
- For x: infx(x) = 13, supx(x) = 14, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3

Check y NE z:
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(y) = 11 ✓
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 ✓

Check x E y:
- supx(y) = 12 <= infx(x) = 13 ✓
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2 ✓
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 3 ✓

Now, let's check the relations between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(x) = 13 ✓ (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2 ✓ (x is to the north of z)
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 2 ✓ (part of the E constraint, but not enough)
- supy(x) = 3 > supy(z) = 1 ✗ (x's upper bound is higher than z's, contradicting the E relation)
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 13 ✓ (part of the N constraint)
- supx(x) = 14 <= supx(z) = 10 ✗ (x's right bound is to the right of z's, contradicting the N relation)

Again, x is NE of z, but not E or N.

Let me try one more example, but let's be a bit more creative.

Let's place the regions in a Cartesian plane:
- Region z is the unit square with the following coordinates: z1(0,0), z2(1,0), z3(1,1), z4(0,1).
- Region y is the unit square with the following coordinates: y1(2,2), y2(3,2), y3(3,3), y4(2,3).
- Region x is the unit square with the following coordinates: x1(4,2.5), x2(5,2.5), x3(5,2.75), x4(4,2.75).

With these coordinates, we have:
- For z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1
- For y: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 3
- For x: infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 2.5, supy(x) = 2.75

Check y NE z:
- supx(z) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2 ✓
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 ✓

Check x E y:
- supx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4 ✓
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2.5 ✓
- supy(x) = 2.75 <= supy(y) = 3 ✓

Now, let's check the relations between x and z:
- supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 4 ✓ (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2.5 ✓ (x is to the north of z)
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 2.5 ✓ (part of the E constraint, but not enough)
- supy(x) = 2.75 > supy(z) = 1 ✗ (x's upper bound is higher than z's, contradicting the E relation)
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 4 ✓ (part of the N constraint)
- supx(x) = 5 <= supx(z) = 1 ✗ (x's right bound is to the right of z's, contradicting the N relation)

Once again, in this example, x is NE of z.

But wait, I need to double-check if NE is the only possibility.

For a region a to be NE of a region b, we need:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the north of b)

From our analysis, we've established that:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

These are the exact conditions for x to be NE of z. Therefore, the most specific and correct relation between x and z is NE.

But wait, there's something off in my analysis. I've been thinking of the regions as rectangles or specific shapes, which might be influencing my conclusion.

Let me revisit the definitions and think more generally:

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of y's y-coordinates)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

For the east-west relationship between x and z:
- From y NE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y)
- From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x)
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- This means x is to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship between x and z:
- From y NE z, we know supy(z) <= infy(y)
- From x E y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x)
- By transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This means x is to the north of z.

We've firmly established that x is both to the east and north of z. But what about other constraints?

From x E y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
From y NE z, we don't have any additional constraints on the y-coordinates.

From y NE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y).
From x E y, we don't have any additional constraints on the x-coordinates.

So, we haven't derived any other constraints on the relationship between x and z besides the fact that x is both east and north of z.

Based on the cardinal direction relations, if supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z), then the relation is NE.

However, I think I've been misunderstanding the question. Let's break it down again. I'm being asked for the possible relations between x and z, not the specific relation.

Given that x is E of y and y is NE of z, the most specific relation we can establish between x and z is that x is NE of z.

However, there might be other possible relations. Let's consider:

1. NE: x is northeast of z. This is definitely true as proven above.

2. N: x is north of z. For this, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z) ✓ (we've proven this)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within the range of z's x-coordinates) ?

   We know that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is east of z. This directly contradicts the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) for the N relation. So, x is not N of z.

3. E: x is east of z. For this, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) ✓ (we've proven this)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of z's y-coordinates) ?

   We know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is north of z. This directly contradicts the constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) for the E relation. So, x is not E of z.

4. SE: x is southeast of z. For this, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) ✓ (we've proven this)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z) ?

   We've proven that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is north of z. This directly contradicts the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) for the SE relation. So, x is not SE of z.

5. S: x is south of z. For this, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z) ?
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within the range of z's x-coordinates) ?

   Again, supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts the condition for S. Also, supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the constraint for S. So, x is not S of z.

6. SW: x is southwest of z. For this, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z) ?
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z) ?

   We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is east of z. This contradicts the constraint for SW. So, x is not SW of z.

7. W: x is west of z. For this, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z) ?
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of z's y-coordinates) ?

   Again, supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the constraint for W. So, x is not W of z.

8. NW: x is northwest of z. For this, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z) ?
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z) ✓ (we've proven this)

   Once again, supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the constraint for NW. So, x is not NW of z.

9. B: x is bounding z. For this, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) (z bounds x) ?

   The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the constraint for B. So, x is not B of z.

Given the constraints from our analysis:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

The only cardinal direction relation that's consistent with these constraints is NE.

So, based on the given information, the relation between x and z is NE.

Actually, wait a minute. I think I've been misinterpreting again.

The question asks for the "possible relations", which suggests there might be multiple valid relations. Let's reconsider.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of y's y-coordinates)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

By transitivity, we've established:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

Based on these constraints, the relation between x and z can be one of:
1. NE: This requires x to be both east and north of z, which our constraints satisfy. So, NE is a valid relation.

But there are other possible relations that don't conflict with these constraints:

2. B: This requires z to be inside the bounding box of x. Our constraints don't force this to be true, but they also don't rule it out. So, B is a possible relation.

3. N: This requires x to be north of z but within the x-coordinates of z. Our constraints assure that x is north of z, but they don't force x to be within the x-coordinates of z. So, N is a possible relation.

4. E: This requires x to be east of z but within the y-coordinates of z. Our constraints assure that x is east of z, but they don't force x to be within the y-coordinates of z. So, E is a possible relation.

5. NW, W, SW, S, SE: These all contradict the constraint that x is to the east of z, so they're not possible.

I think my mistake has been trying to impose additional constraints based on specific examples. 

Ok let's think step by step.

Let's decompose the problem.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of y's y-coordinates)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

By transitivity, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), thus supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), thus supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

Now, let's check each of the nine cardinal direction relations:

1. NE: For x to be NE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) ✓
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z) ✓
   Both conditions are satisfied by the transitivity results above.

2. N: For x to be N of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z) ✓
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within the range of z's x-coordinates) ?
   The first condition is satisfied, but for the second, we know that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x is not N of z.

3. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z) ?
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z) ✓
   The second condition is satisfied, but for the first, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z, not west. So, x is not NW of z.

4. W: For x to be W of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z) ?
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of z's y-coordinates) ?
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z, not west. So, x is not W of z.

5. SW: For x to be SW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z) ?
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z) ?
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z, not west. So, x is not SW of z.

6. S: For x to be S of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z) ?
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within the range of z's x-coordinates) ?
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of z, not south. So, x is not S of z.

7. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) ✓
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z) ?
   The first condition is satisfied, but for the second, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of z, not south. So, x is not SE of z.

8. E: For x to be E of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) ✓
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of z's y-coordinates) ?
   The first condition is satisfied, but for the second, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is entirely above z, not within the y-range of z. So, x is not E of z.

9. B: For x to be B of z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) (z bounds x) ?
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z. This contradicts the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) for the B relation. So, x is not B of z.

Based on this exhaustive check, the only valid relation between x and z is NE.

Hmm, but I still need to double-check, because I'm trying to find all possible relations, not just the most specific one.

Let me reconsider:

From our transitivity derivations, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

These constraints mean x is to the north-east of z on the Cartesian plane. Specifically, the entirety of region x is to the right and above region z. The constraints don't prohibit other arrangements; they only specify this minimum separation.

Let's consider the compatibility of these constraints with each of the nine cardinal direction relations. A relation is possible if there's at least one way to position regions x and z on the plane (while maintaining the constraints) such that the relation holds. Conversely, a relation is impossible if there's no way to satisfy both the constraints and the relation's criteria.

1. NE: Requires x to be north-east of z. Our constraints ensure this, so it's possible.

2. N: Requires x to be north of z and x's x-range to be contained within z's x-range.
   Our constraints ensure x is north of z, but they also require x to be east of z, meaning x's x-range is to the right of z's x-range, not contained within it. So, N is not possible.

3. NW: Requires x to be north-west of z.
   Our constraints require x to be east of z, which contradicts the west direction. So, NW is not possible.

4. W: Requires x to be west of z.
   Again, our constraints require x to be east of z, contradicting W. So, W is not possible.

5. SW: Requires x to be south-west of z.
   Our constraints require x to be both north and east of z, contradicting SW. So, SW is not possible.

6. S: Requires x to be south of z.
   Our constraints require x to be north of z, contradicting S. So, S is not possible.

7. SE: Requires x to be south-east of z.
   Our constraints require x to be north of z, contradicting SE. So, SE is not possible.

8. E: Requires x to be east of z and x's y-range to be contained within z's y-range.
   Our constraints ensure x is east of z, but they also require x to be north of z, meaning x's y-range is above z's y-range, not contained within it. So, E is not possible.

9. B: Requires z to be fully inside the bounding box of x.
   Our constraints require a clear separation between the x-ranges and y-ranges of the two regions, which means one can't be inside the other's bounding box. So, B is not possible.

After this thorough check, it seems the only valid relation between x and z, given the constraints, is NE.

However, let me re-check once more, because the wording of the problem "If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" suggets that there might be multiple possible relations. Let me think again.

Let's reinterpret what the problem is asking. The question is about the possible relations between x and z, not the specific relation. It's asking which relations are consistent with the given constraints.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of y's y-coordinates)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

By transitivity, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), thus supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), thus supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

These constraints tell us that x is to the east of z and north of z. In terms of the cardinal direction relations, this places x in the NE quadrant relative to z.

Now, we need to check which of the nine cardinal direction relations are consistent with these constraints:

1. NE: This is definitely consistent, as our constraints directly imply that x is NE of z. Possible.

2. N: The constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) implies that x is to the east of z. But for the N relation, we need x's x-coordinates to be within the range of z's x-coordinates, which contradicts x being to the east of z. Not possible.

3. NW: The constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) implies that x is to the east of z, which contradicts the west component of NW. Not possible.

4. W: Similarly, the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the definition of the W relation. Not possible.

5. SW: Both the south and west components of this relation contradict our derived constraints. Not possible.

6. S: The constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) implies that x is to the north of z, which contradicts the south component of the S relation. Not possible.

7. SE: The constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) implies that x is to the north of z, which contradicts the south component of the SE relation. Not possible.

8. E: The constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) implies that x is to the north of z. But for the E relation, we need x's y-coordinates to be within the range of z's y-coordinates, which contradicts x being to the north of z. Not possible.

9. B: The constraints imply that x is both to the east and north of z, which means there's a clear separation between them. For the B relation, we need one region to be inside the bounding box of the other, which contradicts our derived constraints. Not possible.

After this thorough check, it appears that NE is the only possible relation between x and z that's consistent with the given constraints.

Let me be extra sure and think about it from a different angle.

The key constraints we've derived are:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

For a particular cardinal direction relation to be possible, it must be consistent with these constraints. Let's go through each relation again:

1. NE: For x to be NE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) ✓
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z) ✓
   Both conditions align with our derived constraints, so NE is possible.

2. N: For x to be N of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z) ✓
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within the range of z's x-coordinates) ?
   The first condition is satisfied, but the second part, supx(x) <= supx(z), contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) <= supx(x) (by the definition of infimum and supremum), the transitive chain would give supx(z) <= supx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z) for the N relation. So, N is not possible.

3. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z) ?
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z) ✓
   The second condition is satisfied, but the first condition contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x). If both were true, we'd have the chain supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which would imply supx(x) <= infx(x), contradicting the definition of infimum and supremum. So, NW is not possible.

4. W: For x to be W of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z) ?
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of z's y-coordinates) ?
   The first condition contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) for the same reason as in the NW relation. So, W is not possible.

5. SW: For x to be SW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z) ?
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z) ?
   The first condition contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) for the same reason as in the NW relation. The second condition contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x). If both were true, we'd have the chain supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which would imply supy(x) <= infy(x), contradicting the definition of infimum and supremum. So, SW is not possible.

6. S: For x to be S of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z) ?
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within the range of z's x-coordinates) ?
   The first condition contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) for the same reason as in the SW relation. The second part, supx(x) <= supx(z), also contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) for the same reason as in the N relation. So, S is not possible.

7. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) ✓
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z) ?
   The first condition is satisfied, but the second contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) for the same reason as in the SW relation. So, SE is not possible.

8. E: For x to be E of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z) ✓
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-coordinates are within the range of z's y-coordinates) ?
   The first condition is satisfied, but the second part, supy(x) <= supy(z), contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x). If both were true, we'd have the chain supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which would imply supy(x) <= infy(x), contradicting the definition of infimum and supremum. So, E is not possible.

9. B: For x to be B of z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (z's x-bounds are outside x's x-bounds) ?
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (z's y-bounds are outside x's y-bounds) ?
   The first part, supx(x) <= supx(z), contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) for the same reason as in the N relation. The second part, supy(x) <= supy(z), contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) for the same reason as in the E relation. So, B is not possible.

After this thorough (and hopefully correct) check, it appears that NE is the only relation between x and z that is consistent with the transitivity constraints we derived. Simply put, if x is E of y and y is NE of z, then x must be NE of z.

Actually, let me think through it one more time before answering. NE is the relation between x and z if the constraints supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) are satisfied. According to the deifnition of cardinal directions, that's precisely what NE means. So in the given scenario, the relation between x and z is NE. No other relation is possible.

ANSWER:

The question asks which relations are possible between region x and region z, given the constraints:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Let me analyze what we know from these constraints:

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within y's y-range)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

By transitivity, I can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), therefore supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), therefore supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

These constraints show that x is both to the east and north of z, which precisely defines the NE relation.

The answer is: NE
