PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

First, let's analyze the information we have:
- Region x is B of region y, meaning x is in the bounding box of y.
- Region y is SE of region z, meaning y is in the southeast direction from z.

Now I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's use the definitions provided to reason through this:

When we say "x is B of y", it means:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

When we say "y is SE of z", it means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, I need to determine what constraints these place on the relationship between x and z.

From "x is B of y", I know that x is contained within the bounding box of y.
From "y is SE of z", I know that y is entirely to the southeast of z.

Since x is contained within y's bounding box, and y is entirely to the southeast of z, x could be in several different positions relative to z:

1. If x is in the lower-right part of y's bounding box, x would be SE of z (like y).
2. If x extends left within y's bounding box, x could be S of z.
3. If x extends upward within y's bounding box, x could be E of z.
4. If x is positioned in such a way that it overlaps with z's bounding box, x could be B of z.

Let me think about this more carefully using the constraints:

From "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (1)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (2)

From "x is B of y":
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (3)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (4)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (5)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (6)

From (1) and (3): supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x)

From (2) and (6): supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z)

These two derived constraints tell us that x is either SE, E, S, or possibly B (if the boundaries touch) relative to z.

But wait, I need to think more about the possibility of B. 

For x to be B of z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

But we already have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) (unless supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x), which would make x a vertical line at the eastern boundary of z). Similarly, supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x).

So, x cannot be B of z.

Similarly, for x to be NE, N, or NW of z, we would need infy(x) >= supy(z). But we have supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z, contradicting these directions.

For x to be W or SW of z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z). But we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z, contradicting these directions.

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, E, or S.

Wait, let me double-check for any other possibilities or if I've made any mistakes.

Actually, let's reconsider.

If "x is B of y", it means x is contained within the bounding box of y.
If "y is SE of z", it means y is entirely to the southeast of z.

Now, since x is contained within y's bounding box, and y is entirely to the southeast of z, the possible relations between x and z depend on the exact position of x within y's bounding box.

Let me reconsider the constraints:

From "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From "x is B of y":
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From these, I can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z)

These constraints ensure that x is to the right of and below z. Given the cardinal directions, this places x in the SE, E, or S direction from z.

But I need to verify if any other direction is possible.

For instance, could x be SW of z?
For that, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But from our derived constraints, we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

Similarly, x cannot be W, NW, N, or NE of z due to the constraints.

For x to be B of z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

But again, this contradicts our derived constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, E, or S.

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider once more for completeness.

Let's be very clear about the meanings:
- "x is B of y" means x is inside the bounding box of y.
- "y is SE of z" means y is in the southeast direction from z.

Let's re-examine the constraints from "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [y is to the right of z]
- supy(y) <= infy(z) [y is below z]

And from "x is B of y":
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge]
- infy(y) <= infy(x) [x's bottom edge is above or at y's bottom edge]
- supy(x) <= supy(y) [x's top edge is below or at y's top edge]

From these, I can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the right of z]
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) [x is below z]

These place x to the right of and below z, which corresponds to a SE direction.

But I need to check other directions too.

For E direction, I would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the right of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) [x's bottom edge is at or above z's bottom edge]
- supy(x) <= supy(z) [x's top edge is at or below z's top edge]

But from the constraints, I know supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the requirement for E direction that infy(z) <= infy(x), because it would mean infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which forces infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z), making x a degenerate region, which is not allowed in REG. So, x cannot be E of z.

For S direction, I would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [x is below z]
- infx(z) <= infx(x) [x's left edge is at or to the right of z's left edge]
- supx(x) <= supx(z) [x's right edge is at or to the left of z's right edge]

But from the constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x's left edge is strictly to the right of z's right edge. This contradicts the requirement for S direction that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

So the only possible relation between x and z is SE. But let's double-check the other directions just to be sure.

For SW, W, and NW, x would need to be to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)), but our constraints give supx(z) <= infx(x), which places x to the right of z. So, x cannot be SW, W, or NW of z.

For N, NE, and NW, x would need to be above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), but our constraints give supy(x) <= infy(z), which places x below z. So, x cannot be N, NE, or NW of z.

For B, x would need to be inside the bounding box of z (infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)). But our constraints give supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), which place x outside the bounding box of z. So, x cannot be B of z.

In conclusion, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Hmm, let's double check our reasoning. I'm worried we haven't fully explored the possible configurations.

Region x is B of region y, meaning x is in the bounding box of y.
Region y is SE of region z, meaning y is in the southeast direction from z.

Actually, let me use a different approach. Let's define the possible positions of all these regions in terms of their bounding boxes:

For region z, let's denote its bounding box with coordinates:
- Left edge: xL_z
- Right edge: xR_z
- Bottom edge: yB_z
- Top edge: yT_z

For region y, since it's SE of z, we have:
- Left edge: xL_y, where xR_z <= xL_y
- Right edge: xR_y, where xR_y > xL_y
- Bottom edge: yB_y, where yB_y < yT_z
- Top edge: yT_y, where yT_y <= yB_z

For region x, since it's B of y, we have:
- Left edge: xL_x, where xL_y <= xL_x
- Right edge: xR_x, where xR_x <= xR_y
- Bottom edge: yB_x, where yB_y <= yB_x
- Top edge: yT_x, where yT_x <= yT_y

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z by considering the conditions for each cardinal direction.

For SE, x must be to the right of and below z:
- xR_z <= xL_x: This holds because xR_z <= xL_y <= xL_x.
- yT_x <= yB_z: This holds because yT_x <= yT_y <= yB_z.

So, x can definitely be SE of z.

For S, x must be below z and horizontally aligned:
- xL_z <= xL_x and xR_x <= xR_z: This doesn't hold because we have xR_z <= xL_y <= xL_x, which contradicts xR_x <= xR_z.

For E, x must be to the right of z and vertically aligned:
- xR_z <= xL_x: This holds.
- yB_z <= yB_x and yT_x <= yT_z: This doesn't hold because we have yT_x <= yT_y <= yB_z, which contradicts yB_z <= yB_x.

For B, x must be inside the bounding box of z:
- xL_z <= xL_x and xR_x <= xR_z: This doesn't hold because we have xR_z <= xL_y <= xL_x, which contradicts xR_x <= xR_z.
- yB_z <= yB_x and yT_x <= yT_z: This doesn't hold because we have yT_x <= yT_y <= yB_z, which contradicts yB_z <= yB_x.

For N, x must be above z and horizontally aligned:
- xL_z <= xL_x and xR_x <= xR_z: This doesn't hold.
- yT_z <= yB_x: This doesn't hold because we have yT_x <= yT_y <= yB_z < yT_z, which contradicts yT_z <= yB_x.

For NE, x must be to the right of and above z:
- xR_z <= xL_x: This holds.
- yT_z <= yB_x: This doesn't hold.

For NW, x must be to the left of and above z:
- xR_x <= xL_z: This doesn't hold.
- yT_z <= yB_x: This doesn't hold.

For W, x must be to the left of z and vertically aligned:
- xR_x <= xL_z: This doesn't hold.
- yB_z <= yB_x and yT_x <= yT_z: This doesn't hold.

For SW, x must be to the left of and below z:
- xR_x <= xL_z: This doesn't hold.
- yT_x <= yB_z: This holds.

In conclusion, among the nine possible cardinal directions, the only one that is consistent with the given constraints is SE. Region x can only be SE of region z.

Actually, I need to be careful here, because there's something I'm missing.

When we say "x is B of y", it means x is fully contained within the bounding box of y. It doesn't mean x is the entire bounding box of y. So, x can be a smaller region inside y's bounding box, and its exact location within that bounding box is not fully determined.

Let me reason through this once more, more carefully:

1. Region y is SE of region z. This means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) [y is strictly to the right of z]
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) [y is strictly below z]

2. Region x is B of region y. This means:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) [x's left edge is at or to the right of y's left edge]
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) [x's right edge is at or to the left of y's right edge]
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) [x's bottom edge is at or above y's bottom edge]
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) [x's top edge is at or below y's top edge]

Now, I can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the right of z]
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) [x's top edge is below z's bottom edge]

These place x to the right of z and with its top edge below z's bottom edge. This suggests x is in a SE direction from z.

But let's check other possibilities more carefully:

For E direction, x needs to be to the right of z and vertically aligned with z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the right of z]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) [x extends up to at least z's bottom]
- supy(x) <= supy(z) [x doesn't extend above z's top]

But from the constraints, supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x's top edge is below z's bottom edge, which contradicts the vertical alignment requirement for E. So, x cannot be E of z.

For S direction, x needs to be below z and horizontally aligned with z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [x is below z]
- infx(z) <= infx(x) [x doesn't extend left of z]
- supx(x) <= supx(z) [x doesn't extend right of z]

But from the constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x's left edge is to the right of z's right edge, which contradicts the horizontal alignment requirement for S. So, x cannot be S of z.

Let's check the remaining directions:

For B direction, x needs to be within the bounding box of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) [x's left edge is at or to the right of z's left edge]
- supx(x) <= supx(z) [x's right edge is at or to the left of z's right edge]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) [x's bottom edge is at or above z's bottom edge]
- supy(x) <= supy(z) [x's top edge is at or below z's top edge]

But, as we've seen, supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradict the requirements for B. So, x cannot be B of z.

For N, NE, NW, x would need to be above z, but we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), placing x below z. So, x cannot be N, NE, or NW of z.

For W, SW, x would need to be to the left of z, but we've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), placing x to the right of z. So, x cannot be W or SW of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Let me triple-check my reasoning by thinking about this geometrically:

Region z is in some position.
Region y is strictly to the southeast of z (outside z, to the right and below).
Region x is within the bounding box of y.

The only way x can extend outside of the SE region from z is if it extends outside of y's bounding box, which it doesn't by definition. So, x must be entirely within the SE region from z, which means the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Thus, I'm confident that the answer is SE.

Actually, there's a potential issue with my reasoning. I need to be careful about the strict definitions of cardinal directions.

Let me reconsider the cardinal direction relations more carefully:

- SE relation: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
- S relation: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- E relation: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

From our constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

For SE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (This is satisfied from our constraints)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (This is also satisfied from our constraints)

So, x can be SE of z.

For S, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (This is satisfied from our constraints)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which is stronger than what we need)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (This might or might not be true)

For S to be a possible relation, we need to check if there's a configuration where supx(x) <= supx(z) while still satisfying other constraints.

From "x is B of y", we have supx(x) <= supx(y). If it's possible for supx(y) <= supx(z), then it's possible for supx(x) <= supx(z), which would make S a possible relation.

But, from "y is SE of z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y). This means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of y. This contradicts the possibility of supx(y) <= supx(z). So, S is not a possible relation.

Actually, let me be extremely careful here and reread the definitions. The definition of S is:

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

Translating to our problem:
- x S z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From "y is SE of z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y). This means the right edge of z is strictly to the left of the left edge of y. And from "x is B of y", we have infx(y) <= infx(x). This means the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y. Combined, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which says the right edge of z is strictly to the left of the left edge of x.

This contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x), which would say the left edge of z is to the left of or at the left edge of x.

Similarly:
- x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

We already have supx(z) <= infx(x) from our constraints. But for E to be satisfied, we also need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From "y is SE of z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z). And from "x is B of y", we have infy(y) <= infy(x). Combined, we have supy(y) <= infy(z) and infy(y) <= infy(x).

But this doesn't necessarily mean infy(z) <= infy(x) or supy(x) <= supy(z).

In fact, from "y is SE of z", supy(y) <= infy(z), and from "x is B of y", supy(x) <= supy(y), we get supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). This means the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z, which contradicts the vertical alignment required for E.

So, E is also not a possible relation.

For the other directions, the contradictions are similar or more apparent.

In conclusion, among the nine possible cardinal directions, the only one that can hold between x and z given the constraints is SE.

I'm not entirely convinced with my reasoning, so let me re-examine the problem from a different angle.

Let's draw a coordinate system. Suppose region z is at the origin, with its bounding box being the unit square from (0,0) to (1,1).

From "y is SE of z", y should be somewhere in the quadrant to the right and below z. Let's say y's bounding box is from (2,−3) to (4,−1). This satisfies supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

From "x is B of y", x should be inside y's bounding box. Let's say x's bounding box is from (2.5,−2.5) to (3.5,−1.5). This satisfies infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).

Now, what's the relation between x and z?

From the coordinates:
- x is to the right of z: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 2.5.
- x is below z: supy(x) = −1.5 <= infy(z) = 0.

This indicates that x is SE of z. Let's check other potential relations:

For S, we'd need:
- x is below z: This holds.
- x is horizontally aligned with z: This doesn't hold because x is to the right of z.

For E, we'd need:
- x is to the right of z: This holds.
- x is vertically aligned with z: This doesn't hold because x is below z.

For B, we'd need x to be inside z's bounding box, which doesn't hold.

For N, NE, NW, x would need to be above z, which doesn't hold.

For W, SW, x would need to be to the left of z, which doesn't hold.

This confirms that the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Actually, let's be even more careful. Let's just think about all possible positions of x and y given the constraints:

- Region y is SE of region z.
- Region x is B of region y.

From the definition of SE, y is strictly to the right of z and strictly below z.
From the definition of B, x is inside the bounding box of y.

No matter where exactly y is located (as long as it's in the SE quadrant from z), and no matter where exactly x is located within y's bounding box, one thing is clear: x is to the right of z and below z, which places it in the SE quadrant from z.

Now, to be in the S, E, B, N, NE, NW, W, or SW direction from z, x would need to satisfy different constraints, which would require it to be in a different position relative to z. Given the fixed constraints "y is SE of z" and "x is B of y", there's no way for x to satisfy those other constraints.

So, definitively, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

So my answer is SE.

Wait, I'm having a realization. In the problem statement, it's asking which "could be the possible relations between region x and region z". Since we've established that x is to the right of z and below z, it's definitely in the SE quadrant from z. But that doesn't mean the exact relation is SE. It "could" be S, E, or SE, depending on the exact positioning of x within y's bounding box.

Let me reconsider the constraints more carefully.

From the definition of cardinal directions:
- SE: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
- S: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- E: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

From "y is SE of z", we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From "x is B of y", we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

I've already established that:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (from the first constraint of each)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (from the last constraint of "x is B of y" and the last constraint of "y is SE of z")

These constraints mean x is to the right of z and below z. Let's check the constraints for S, E, and SE:

For SE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (This is satisfied from our derived constraints)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (This is also satisfied from our derived constraints)

So, x can be SE of z.

For S, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (This is satisfied from our derived constraints)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which is stronger than what we need, so this is satisfied)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (This is not necessarily satisfied based on the given constraints)

For S to be a possible relation, we need to check if there's a configuration where supx(x) <= supx(z) while still satisfying other constraints.

From "x is B of y", we have supx(x) <= supx(y), and from "y is SE of z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y). Together, these give supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= supx(y).

For supx(x) <= supx(z) to be possible, we'd need supx(y) <= supx(z). But from "y is SE of z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y), which means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of y. This contradicts the possibility of supx(y) <= supx(z). So, S is not a possible relation.

For E, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (This is satisfied from our derived constraints)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (This is not necessarily satisfied based on the given constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (This is also not necessarily satisfied)

For E to be a possible relation, we need to check if there's a configuration where infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) while still satisfying other constraints.

From "y is SE of z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z), and from "x is B of y", we have infy(y) <= infy(x). Together, these give supy(y) <= infy(z) and infy(y) <= infy(x).

For infy(z) <= infy(x) to be possible, we'd need infy(z) <= infy(y). But from "y is SE of z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z), which means the top edge of y is below the bottom edge of z. This contradicts the possibility of infy(z) <= infy(y). So, E is not a possible relation.

Thus, among the relations SE, S, and E, only SE is possible.

But wait, let's also check for the potential combination of regions that might result in different relations. 

Actually, let me think through this problem visually. I'm being too tied up in the formal definitions, which is causing me to potentially miss some insight.

The problem says:
- Region x is B of region y.
- Region y is SE of region z.

B mean region x is in the bounding box of region y. 
SE means region y is to the south-east of region z. 

So y is to the south-east of z, and x is in the bounding box of y. This means x is contained within y, which is to the south-east of z. So x must also be to the south-east of z.

Wait, I need to be careful. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, but they don't have to be disks or rectangles. They can be irregularly shaped. So, when I say "y is SE of z", it doesn't mean y is entirely to the south-east of z, just that its bounding box is.

Let's redraw the scenario. Imagine a coordinate system:

1. Region z is a shape with its bounding box centered at the origin (0, 0).
2. Region y is a shape with its bounding box placed to the south-east of z, say around (3, -3).
3. Region x is a shape that is contained entirely within the bounding box of y.

Now, while y is officially "SE of z", it's possible that y extends all the way to the bottom edge of z, or all the way to the right edge of z.

Similarly, x could be positioned anywhere within y's bounding box, as long as it's entirely contained.

That said, given the strict definitions:
- y is SE of z means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
- x is B of y means infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), meaning x is to the right of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), meaning x is below z.

These constraints place x in the SE quadrant with respect to z. But SE is not the only relation that encompasses regions in the SE quadrant.

Let's check for the constraints of other cardinal directions:

For S, we need supx(x) <= supx(z), which means the right edge of x is to the left of the right edge of z. But we've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. These two constraints are contradictory. So, x can't be S of z.

For E, we need infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the bottom edge of x is at or above the bottom edge of z. But we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. These two constraints are contradictory. So, x can't be E of z.

Given these contradictions, the only possible relation that places x to the right of z and below z without additional constraints is SE.

But let's also check other potential cardinal directions:

For B, x would need to be inside the bounding box of z, which we've shown is contradictory with the constraints from "y is SE of z" and "x is B of y".

For N, NE, NW, x would need to be above z, which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).

For W, SW, x would need to be to the left of z, which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).

So, among the nine cardinal directions, the only one that can be satisfied given the constraints is SE.

Therefore, my answer is that the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.

Actually wait, let me look at the full set of definitions again. The problem is about cardinal direction relations, which can include multiple tiles. In the problem definition, it says:

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied:
i) 1 <= k <= 9,
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE},
iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j,
iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

So a region can be in multiple cardinal directions relative to another. However, the problem is asking for the possible "relations" between x and z. Given the way the problem is set up, and the fact that "y is SE of z" and "x is B of y" (not a complex cardinal direction expression), I think it's asking for the single-tile cardinal direction relations that can hold between x and z.

Given the constraints from "y is SE of z" and "x is B of y", we've established that x is to the right of z and below z. This places x in the SE quadrant with respect to z. The only single-tile cardinal direction relation that encompasses this positioning is SE.

So, in conclusion, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.

On second thought, now I am unclear if y or z are described by single-tile or multi-tile cardinal directions. The problem says "y is SE of z" and "x is B of y", which does point towards single-tile cardinal directions. So I continue to believe that x is SE of z is the only possibility.

Ah, I see the source of my confusion. The problem says:

Given a region a, the greatest lower bound of the projection of a on the x-axis (similarly in y-axis) is denoted by infx(a) (similarly infy(a)). The least upper bound or the supremum of the projection of a on the x-axis (similarly in y-axis) is denoted by supx(a) (similarly supy(a)).

These bounds construct the minimum bounding box of a region a, which is the box formed by the straight lines x=infx(a), x=supx(a), y=infy(a) and y=supy(a)).

From this, it's clear that we're working with the bounding boxes of the regions. The cardinal directions are defined in terms of these bounding boxes, not the exact shape of the regions.

Now, let's revise our understanding of the problem:

- Region y is SE of region z. This means the bounding box of y is to the southeast of the bounding box of z.
- Region x is B of region y. This means the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y.

Given these, the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y, which is to the southeast of the bounding box of z. This means the bounding box of x is also to the southeast of the bounding box of z. Thus, the relation between x and z is only SE.

Actually, I think I might have been over-complicating things from the start. Let me think about this once more, and directly:

Imagine region z on the plane. Draw a vertical line at z's rightmost extent and a horizontal line at z's bottom-most extent. These two lines divide the plane into four quadrants: South-west, South-east, North-west, and North-east (relative to z). 

The constraint "y is SE of z" means that y is located entirely within the South-east quadrant.

The constraint "x is B of y" means that x is fully contained within the bounding box of y.

Since y is entirely in the South-east quadrant of z, and x is within y's bounding box, x must also be entirely in the South-east quadrant of z.

Given the cardinal direction definitions, a region is in the SE direction if it's entirely to the right of and below the reference region. Since x is entirely to the right of and below z, the relation between x and z is only SE.

So, to the question "Which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", my answer is only SE.

Actually, wait. I'm not sure that my statements about being "entirely in the South-east quadrant" are correct. Let's revisit the definition of cardinal directions:

- SE relation: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b). This means a is entirely to the right of b, and a is entirely below b.
- S relation: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). This means a is entirely below b, and a is horizontally aligned with b (a doesn't go beyond b's left or right edges).
- E relation: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). This means a is entirely to the right of b, and a is vertically aligned with b (a doesn't go beyond b's top or bottom edges).

Given the constraints from "y is SE of z" and "x is B of y", we've derived:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

For S, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've shown)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (we have a stronger condition supx(z) <= infx(x))
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (this is not necessarily true)

Actually, actually, let's just examine the constraints directly:

"x is B of y" means:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y]
- infy(y) <= infy(x) [bottom edge of x is at or above the bottom edge of y]
- supy(x) <= supy(y) [top edge of x is at or below the top edge of y]

"y is SE of z" means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [left edge of y is to the right of the right edge of z]
- supy(y) <= infy(z) [top edge of y is below the bottom edge of z]

Combining the first constraint of each gives: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). This means the left edge of x is to the right of the right edge of z. In other words, x is strictly to the right of z.

Combining the last constraint of each gives: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). This means the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. In other words, x is strictly below z.

Being strictly to the right of z and strictly below z, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Actually wait, we need to check if combinations of cardinal direction tiles are possible. For example, if a region has some parts in B and some parts in SE, the relation would be B:SE (using the notation from the problem). But this only makes sense for a region that spans multiple tiles. In this case, given the constraints, x is strictly to the right of and below z, which places it entirely in the SE tile. So no combination of tiles is possible.

In conclusion, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.

Ah wait. I wanted to check if SE is the only relation, but now I realize I misunderstood what the question was asking. The question is "Which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

Given what we've established:
- x is strictly to the right of z (from supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)).
- x is strictly below z (from supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)).

There's only one possible relation for x relative to z, and that's SE.

So the answer to the question is SE.

Actually, let me just double check that the only possible option is SE. In other words, let me check that the exact relation has to be that x is strictly to the right of and strictly below z, rather than at the boundary of z.

Let me go back to the definitions of SE:

- SE relation: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is strictly to the right of z]
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [x is strictly below z]

These conditions are satisfied based on the constraints from "y is SE of z" and "x is B of y", as I've shown. This confirms that SE is the only possible relation between x and z.

Let me repeat to be 100% sure:

1. From "y is SE of z" and the definition of SE, I know that y is strictly to the right of and strictly below z.
2. From "x is B of y" and the definition of B, I know that x is inside the bounding box of y.
3. Combining these, x is also strictly to the right of and strictly below z. Let me show directly by the constraints:

   From "y is SE of z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
   From "x is B of y", we have infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).

   Combining the first conditions of "y is SE of z" and "x is B of y", I get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
   Combining the second condition of "y is SE of z" and the fourth condition of "x is B of y", I get supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).

   These deductions show that supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), which means that x is strictly to the right of and strictly below z.

4. The only possible relation for a region strictly to the right of and strictly below another is SE.

Thus, the answer to the question "Which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is only SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

First, let me analyze what we know:
- Region x is B of region y: This means x is inside the bounding box of y
- Region y is SE of region z: This means y is in the southeast direction from z

From the definition of SE:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is strictly to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is strictly below z)

From the definition of B:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge is at or to the right of y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge is at or to the left of y's right edge)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom edge is at or above y's bottom edge)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top edge is at or below y's top edge)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is strictly to the right of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is strictly below z)

Being strictly to the right of z and strictly below z means x can only be in the SE direction from z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.
