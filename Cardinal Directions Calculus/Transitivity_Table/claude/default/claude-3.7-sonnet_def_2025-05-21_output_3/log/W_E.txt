PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y, i.e., x W y
- Region y is E of region z, i.e., y E z

Let's recall the definition of the relations W and E:

For "x W y" (x is West of y):
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

For "y E z" (y is East of z):
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, I want to determine what relation(s) might hold between x and z. Let me analyze what we can deduce from the given relations:

From "x W y", we know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y E z", we know:
3. supx(z) <= infx(y)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For the x-coordinate:
From 1 and 3, we have:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z) or between infx(x) and infx(z). x could be to the west of z, or they could overlap in the x-direction, or x could even be to the east of z. 

For the y-coordinate:
From 2 and 4, we have:
infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now, to figure out the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, I'll consider each of the nine cardinal directions and check if it's consistent with the constraints we've deduced.

1. x N z: This requires supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(z), but this doesn't tell us if supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We don't have direct constraints between infx(z) and infx(x) or between supx(x) and supx(z).
   So, x N z is possible.

2. x NE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know supx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't have a direct relationship between infx(y) and infx(x).
   - Similar to the North case, we don't know if supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, x NE z is possible.

3. x E z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Again, we know supx(z) <= infx(y), but not the relationship between infx(y) and infx(x).
   - We do know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, x E z is possible.

4. x SE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Similar to the East case, we're not sure about the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).
   - We know supy(x) <= supy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but this doesn't directly tell us if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   So, x SE z is possible.

5. x S z: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - Similar to the South East case, we're not sure if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We don't have direct constraints between infx(z) and infx(x) or between supx(x) and supx(z).
   So, x S z is possible.

6. x SW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), but this doesn't directly tell us if supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - Similar to the South case, we're not sure if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   So, x SW z is possible.

7. x W z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - As mentioned, we're not sure if supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - We do know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, x W z is possible.

8. x NW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Similar to the West case, we're not sure if supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - And like the North case, we're not sure if supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, x NW z is possible.

9. x B z: This requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We don't have direct constraints between infx(z) and infx(x) or between supx(x) and supx(z).
   - We do know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, x B z is possible.

Wait, I need to rethink this problem because my approach seems to be yielding that all relations are possible, which is unlikely to be correct given the constraints.

Let's approach this differently. I'll consider the possible positions of regions x, y, and z in the plane and see what cardinal direction relations are consistent with the given constraints.

Let's recall the given information:
- x W y: Region x is to the west of region y.
- y E z: Region y is to the east of region z.

From these, we can deduce the positions of x, y, and z on the x-axis:
z (leftmost) --> y (middle) --> x (rightmost)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me reconsider.

For "x W y" (x is West of y):
- supx(x) <= infx(y)  [x's rightmost point is to the left of y's leftmost point]

For "y E z" (y is East of z):
- supx(z) <= infx(y)  [z's rightmost point is to the left of y's leftmost point]

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)

This doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in the x-direction. They could be:
1. x is to the west of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. x and z overlap in the x-direction
3. x is to the east of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)

Now, let's look at the y-direction:

For "x W y" (x is West of y):
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
  [y's bottom is below or at the same level as x's bottom, and x's top is below or at the same level as y's top]

For "y E z" (y is East of z):
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
  [z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom, and y's top is below or at the same level as z's top]

Combining these:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
- This means infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

So in the y-direction, we know:
- z's bottom is below or at the same level as x's bottom.
- x's top is below or at the same level as z's top.

Now, considering both the x and y directions together, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:

1. x W z: If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We're not sure if supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - We do know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, x W z is possible.

2. x NW z: If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We're not sure if supx(x) <= infx(z) or if supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, x NW z is possible (if the y-coordinate conditions are met).

3. x SW z: If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We're not sure if supx(x) <= infx(z) or if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   So, x SW z is possible (if the y-coordinate conditions are met).

4. x B z: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We don't know if infx(z) <= infx(x) or if supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We do know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, x B z is possible (if the x-coordinate conditions are met).

5. x N z: If supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We're not sure if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), or supx(x) <= supx(z).
   So, x N z is possible (if the conditions are met).

6. x S z: If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We're not sure if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), or supx(x) <= supx(z).
   So, x S z is possible (if the conditions are met).

7. x E z: If supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We don't know if supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We do know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, x E z is possible (if the x-coordinate condition is met).

8. x NE z: If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We don't know if supx(z) <= infx(x) or if supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, x NE z is possible (if the conditions are met).

9. x SE z: If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We don't know if supx(z) <= infx(x) or if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   So, x SE z is possible (if the conditions are met).

I'm not drawing any concrete conclusions yet because I'm still getting that all relations are possible. Let me try a more visual approach.

Given:
- x W y: Region x is to the west of region y.
- y E z: Region y is to the east of region z.

Let's represent these spatially:

```
    z   y   x
    |   |   |
  --+---+---+--
    |   |   |
```

From "x W y" we know that x is to the west of y. And from "y E z" we know that y is to the east of z. This means x, y, and z can be arranged horizontally (along the x-axis) as z, y, x from east to west. But this doesn't mean they are perfectly aligned horizontally. They might have different y-coordinates.

Now, let's consider the possible cardinal directions from x to z:

1. x can be W of z:
```
      z
      |
  ----+----
      |
  x   y
  |   |
--+---+--
  |   |
```

2. x can be NW of z:
```
  x   y
  |   |
--+---+--
  |   |
      z
      |
  ----+----
      |
```

3. x can be SW of z:
```
      z
      |
  ----+----
      |
  x   y
  |   |
--+---+--
  |   |
```

4. x can be B (bounding box) of z:
```
  x   y   z
  |   |   |
--+---+---+--
  |   |   |
```

5. x can be E of z:
```
  z   y   x
  |   |   |
--+---+---+--
  |   |   |
```

Wait, no, that's actually inconsistent with our original constraints. If x is to the west of y and y is to the east of z, then x must be to the west of z. So "x E z" is not possible.

Let me revise the analysis by thinking more visually.

Given:
- "x W y": Region x is to the west of region y. This means x is entirely to the left of y, and they might overlap in the y-direction.
- "y E z": Region y is to the east of region z. This means y is entirely to the right of z, and they might overlap in the y-direction.

Visually, we can represent this as:

```
    z   y   x
    |   |   |
  --+---+---+--
    |   |   |
```

or

```
    z
    |
  --+--
    |
    y
    |
  --+--
    |
    x
    |
  --+--
    |
```

or many other configurations where z is to the right of y and y is to the right of x, possibly with different y-coordinates.

Let's reconsider the possible cardinal directions from x to z:

1. x W z: This is definitely a possibility. If z is to the right of y and y is to the right of x, then z is to the right of x. And if they overlap in the y-direction, then x is to the West of z.

2. x NW z: If x is higher (in the y-direction) than z and they don't overlap in the y-direction, then x is to the North West of z.

3. x SW z: If x is lower (in the y-direction) than z and they don't overlap in the y-direction, then x is to the South West of z.

4. x N z: If x is directly above z (they overlap in the x-direction), then x is to the North of z. But given our constraints, this isn't possible, since x must be to the west of y and y must be to the east of z, which means x is to the west of z.

5. x S z: Similarly, x being to the South of z would require them to overlap in the x-direction, which contradicts our established constraints.

6. x E z: As discussed earlier, this contradicts our constraints.

7. x NE z: This would require x to be to the east of z, which again contradicts our constraints.

8. x SE z: This would also require x to be to the east of z, which is inconsistent with our constraints.

9. x B z: This would require x to be within the bounding box of z, which again contradicts our constraints because x must be to the west of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

Wait, I should think about this more carefully. Let me reason with the constraints from the definitions again.

From the constraints, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)  [from x W y]
- supx(z) <= infx(y)  [from y E z]

This tells us that both x and z are to the left of y. But it doesn't tell us directly about the relationship between x and z in the x-direction.

We also know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)  [from x W y]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)  [from y E z]

Let's check each possible relation from x to z:

1. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From the y-constraints, we already know:
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (so infy(z) <= infy(x) holds)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (so supy(x) <= supy(z) holds)

   For the x-constraint, we don't have a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z). They could be in any order. So, x W z is a possibility.

2. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   We don't have direct constraints on either of these. So, x NW z is a possibility.

3. x N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We don't have direct constraints on any of these. So, x N z is a possibility.

4. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   We know supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y), but this doesn't tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).

   So, x NE z is a possibility.

5. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) hold.

   For the x-constraint, as mentioned, we don't have a direct relation between supx(z) and infx(x). So, x E z is a possibility.

6. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   We don't have direct constraints on either of these. So, x SE z is a possibility.

7. x S z:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We don't have direct constraints on any of these. So, x S z is a possibility.

8. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   We don't have direct constraints on either of these. So, x SW z is a possibility.

9. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) hold.

   For the x-constraints, we don't have direct relations. So, x B z is a possibility.

OK, I think the issue is that I'm not drawing on the transitivity of the position relationship. Let me try another approach.

From "x W y" and "y E z", we know that y is between x and z in the x-direction. To visualize:

x --- y --- z

This means that x is definitely to the west of z. So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, W, and SW.

I'm finding myself struggling to provide a logical argument that the above is the case. Let me try one more time:

For "x W y" we have: 
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x's eastmost point is west of y's westmost point)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (y's bounds in the y-direction contain x's bounds)

For "y E z" we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z's eastmost point is west of y's westmost point)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's bounds in the y-direction contain y's bounds)

Combining the x-constraints, we have:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)

This just tells us that both x and z are to the west of y, but it doesn't directly establish a west-east relationship between x and z. They could be side by side.

It may be more incisive to consider specific examples. Let's consider points on a plane:

- y is at (5, 5)
- x is at (2, 5), which is W of y. 
- z is at (3, 5), which would place y E of z. 

In this scenario, if we look at the relationship between x and z, x is to the west of z, i.e., x W z.

Now, let's try another example:

- y is at (5, 5)
- x is at (2, 5), which is W of y.
- z is at (1, 5), which would place y E of z.

In this scenario, if we look at the relationship between x and z, x is to the east of z, i.e., x E z.

Ah, I see the issue now. The z's position is constrained only by "y E z", which means z can be to the west or east of x, or even overlap with x in the x-direction. Let's discuss the possible relationships:

1. x can be West of z (i.e. "x W z"): This is possible, as shown in the first example.
2. x can be East of z (i.e. "x E z"): This is possible, as shown in the second example.
3. x can overlap with z in the x-direction.

Actually, I'm proceeding in a convoluted manner. Let me take a more direct approach:

Given:
- "x W y": Region x is to the west of region y.
- "y E z": Region y is to the east of region z.

Let's check the constraints for each possible relationship of x to z:

1. W: Is x W z possible? Let's check the constraints:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From the given relations:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)

   This doesn't give us a direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

   For the y-constraints, we have:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

   Combining, we get infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

   So, the y-constraints for x W z hold, but the x-constraint is not directly determined by the given relations. This means x W z is possible.

2. NW: For x NW z, the constraints are:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   From the given relations, we can't directly determine if either of these constraints hold. So, x NW z is possible.

3. N: For x N z, the constraints are:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   From the given relations, we can't directly determine if any of these constraints hold. So, x N z is possible.

I think it's becoming clear that the given relations don't provide enough constraints to rule out many (if any) possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Let me try a different approach to reason about this. I'll think in terms of the possible regions in which x and z can be located relative to y.

From "x W y", x is in the west region of y. From "y E z", y is in the east region of z, which means z is in the west region of y. But since we established infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), z's region in the y-direction encompasses x's region. Considering all this, the possible relations from x to z are: W, E, B, NW, N, NE, SW, S, and SE.

I'm not satisfied with this reasoning either.

Let's start with the definitions and work step by step.

For "x W y", we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x's eastmost point is west of y's westmost point)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (y's bounds in the y-direction contain x's bounds)

For "y E z", we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z's eastmost point is west of y's westmost point)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's bounds in the y-direction contain y's bounds)

Let's now analyze the constraints for each cardinal direction from x to z.

1. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From the given relations:
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) holds.
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z) holds.

   But we don't have direct information about supx(x) relative to infx(z). So, x W z is possible.

2. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   For the second constraint, from the given relations:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

   But we don't have direct information about supy(z) relative to infy(x) or about supx(x) relative to infx(z). So, x NW z is possible.

3. x N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   Similar to the NW case, we don't have direct information to determine these. So, x N z is possible.

4. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   For the first constraint, from the given relations:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)

   But this doesn't tell us about supx(z) relative to infx(x). So, x NE z is possible.

5. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) hold. But we don't have direct information about supx(z) relative to infx(x). So, x E z is possible.

6. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   For the second constraint, from the given relations:
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)

   But this doesn't tell us about supy(x) relative to infy(z). So, x SE z is possible.

7. x S z:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   Similar to the SE case, we don't have direct information to determine these. So, x S z is possible.

8. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   Similar to the W and S cases, we don't have direct information to determine these. So, x SW z is possible.

9. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) hold. But we don't have direct information about infx(z) relative to infx(x) or supx(x) relative to supx(z). So, x B z is possible.

But I still feel like I'm missing something. Let's try visualization with a specific example where I place y first, and then place x to the west of y and z to the west of y (making y east of z).

Let's use a coordination system with the origin at the bottom-left. Suppose:
- y is a region centered at (5, 5) with a bounding box of [4, 6] in x and [4, 6] in y.
- x is a region centered at (2, 5) with a bounding box of [1, 3] in x and [4.5, 5.5] in y. This satisfies x W y.
- z is a region centered at (1, 5) with a bounding box of [0, 2] in x and [4, 6] in y. This satisfies y E z.

In this example, x and z overlap in the x direction (since x's bounding box is [1, 3] and z's is [0, 2]). In terms of cardinal directions, this would be x B z, since x is contained within the bounding box of z in both the x and y direction.

Let me try another example:
- y is a region centered at (5, 5) with a bounding box of [4, 6] in x and [4, 6] in y.
- x is a region centered at (2, 5) with a bounding box of [1, 3] in x and [4.5, 5.5] in y. This satisfies x W y.
- z is a region centered at (2, 4) with a bounding box of [1, 3] in x and [3, 5] in y. This satisfies y E z.

In this example, x and z also overlap in the x direction. But in the y direction, z extends a bit lower than x, and x extends a bit higher than z. This doesn't fit cleanly into any of the cardinal directions, perhaps a mix of B and N.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let me simplify and provide a concrete delineation of the possibilites.

Given "x W y" and "y E z", we know:
- x is west of y
- y is east of z

These only constrain the relative positions in the x-direction. The y-direction constraints tell us that x is within the y-range of y, and y is within the y-range of z, but they don't directly constrain the y-relationship between x and z.

So, the possible cardinal relations from x to z are:
- x W z (west): x is directly west of z.
- x NW z (northwest): x is west and north of z.
- x SW z (southwest): x is west and south of z.
- x B z (bounding box): x is within the bounding box of z.
- x E z (east): x is directly east of z.
- x NE z (northeast): x is east and north of z.
- x SE z (southeast): x is east and south of z.
- x N z (north): x is directly north of z.
- x S z (south): x is directly south of z.

Let's use another approach by setting out a picture of the possible regions.

If we visualize a grid where y is in the center (labeled as 'y' below), then:
- From "x W y", x can be anywhere in the region labeled as 'W'.
- From "y E z", z can be anywhere in the region labeled as 'Z'.

```
+------+------+------+
|  NW  |  N   |      |
+------+------+------+
|   W  |  y   |      |
+------+------+------+
|  SW  |  S   |      |
+------+------+------+
```

```
+------+------+------+
|      |      |      |
+------+------+------+
|   Z  |  y   |      |
+------+------+------+
|      |      |      |
+------+------+------+
```

By overlapping these two, we can see that x and z can be in the NW, W, SW, N, B, or S regions relative to each other. But, importantly, the E, NE, and SE regions are not possible for x relative to z, because x is to the west of y and z is to the west of y.

Wait, that last logical deduction doesn't work. Let me start again, and be more precise. From the constraint that x is west of y, and y is east of z, we have:

- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x's eastmost point is west of y's westmost point)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z's eastmost point is west of y's westmost point)

Note: It's important to distinguish betwen "x is west of y" and "y is east of x". They're the same thing. Similarly, "y is east of z" and "z is west of y" are the same. I've used the first form in my reasoning, but make sure it's consistent.

These constraints tell us that both x and z are to the west of y. But they don't directly tell us the relative positions of x and z in the east-west direction.

For x to be east of z (i.e., "x E z" or "z W x"), we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x). From the given constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(y), but this doesn't directly tell us about infx(x). So, x being east of z is possible.

Similarly, for x to be west of z (i.e., "x W z" or "z E x"), we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z). From the given constraints, we know supx(x) <= infx(y), but this doesn't directly tell us about infx(z). So, x being west of z is also possible.

x and z can also overlap in the east-west direction.

In the north-south direction, we have:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means z's bottom is below x's bottom, and z's top is above x's top.

For x to be north of z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). From our combined constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(x), but this doesn't directly tell us about supy(z) relative to infy(x). So, x being north of z is possible.

For x to be south of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). From our combined constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(z), but this doesn't directly tell us about supy(x) relative to infy(z). So, x being south of z is also possible.

But there's a key insight here: From our constraints, we have both infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This means that z's bounds in the y-direction contain x's bounds. In other words, z's region in the y-direction is bigger and encompasses x's region.

Consider the implication for cardinal directions: For x to be North, South, or in the Bounding box of z, z's y-bounds should contain x's y-bounds. We've just established that this holds.

But for x to be NE, E, SE, NW, W, or SW of z, x and z shouldn't overlap in the y-direction. Our constraints indicate they can overlap.

So, the possible cardinal relations from x to z are:
- x W z (west): If x is west of z and they overlap in the y-direction.
- x E z (east): If x is east of z and they overlap in the y-direction.
- x N z (north): If x is north of z (but since z's y-bounds contain x's y-bounds, this isn't straightforward; it's possible if z's top boundary extends much higher than x, placing x in the north segment of z).
- x S z (south): If x is south of z (similar to the North case).
- x B z (bounding box): If x is within the bounding box of z.
- x NW z (northwest): If x is west and north of z.
- x NE z (northeast): If x is east and north of z.
- x SW z (southwest): If x is west and south of z.
- x SE z (southeast): If x is east and south of z.

So, all the cardinal directions seem possible for x relative to z, given the constraints.

But I still feel uncertain about my reasoning. The claim that all directions are possible seems counter-intuitive given the specific constraints of "x W y" and "y E z".

Let's back to the constraints and think about them systematically:
- "x W y" means that x is entirely to the left of y.
- "y E z" means that y is entirely to the right of z.

These constraints don't give us a direct east-west relationship between x and z. x could be to the left of z, or to the right of z, or they could overlap in the east-west direction.

In the north-south direction:
- "x W y" means that y's north-south extent contains x's north-south extent.
- "y E z" means that z's north-south extent contains y's north-south extent.

Combining these, z's north-south extent contains x's north-south extent.

Let's visualize this: Using a grid where each cell represents a possible position for a region.

WEST OF Y:
```
+------+
|   ?  |
+------+
|   x  |
+------+
|   ?  |
+------+
```
x can be in the middle, or might extend to regions above or below.

EAST OF Z:
```
+------+
|   ?  |
+------+
|   y  |
+------+
|   ?  |
+------+
```
y can be in the middle, or might extend to regions above or below.

From our constraints:
- x is to the west of y.
- y is to the east of z.

These don't directly tell us about the east-west relationship between x and z.

I think I've been overthinking it. Let me simplify: Given "x W y" and "y E z", I need to determine which cardinal relation(s) could exist from x to z.

From the constraints, considering the north-south and east-west directions, the possible relations from x to z are: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE.

Actually, let's reason it through step by step once more. I feel like I'm missing something obvious.

Let's think from first principles again:

1. "x W y" means:
   - x is west of y (i.e., x is to the left of y)
   - The y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of y.

2. "y E z" means:
   - y is east of z (i.e., y is to the right of z)
   - The y-extent of y is contained within the y-extent of z.

Now, when we combine these:
- If x is to the left of y and y is to the right of z, then x can be to the left, to the right, or overlapping with z in the east-west direction.
- The y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of y, which is contained within the y-extent of z. This means the y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of z.

For the cardinal relations:
- For NW, N, and NE: These require x to be above z. Since the y-extent of x is contained within that of z, these are only possible if x is in the upper portion of z's y-extent.
- For W, B, and E: These are the most straightforward as they align with our deduction about the y-extent. These are all possible.
- For SW, S, and SE: These require x to be below z. Since the y-extent of x is contained within that of z, these are only possible if x is in the lower portion of z's y-extent.

I conclude that all nine cardinal relations from x to z are possible.

Let's see if I can devise examples to demonstrate each relation:

1. x W z: Place x to the left of z, and they overlap in the y-direction.
2. x NW z: Place x to the left and above of z, ensuring that the y-extent of z still contains that of x.
3. x N z: Place x directly above z.
4. x NE z: Place x to the right and above of z.
5. x E z: Place x to the right of z, and they overlap in the y-direction.
6. x SE z: Place x to the right and below of z.
7. x S z: Place x directly below z.
8. x SW z: Place x to the left and below of z.
9. x B z: Place x inside the bounds of z.

But wait... some of these don't align with the constraints. Let me revisit them carefully:

1. "x W y": This means that x is entirely to the west (left) of y, i.e., the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y.
2. "y E z": This means that y is entirely to the east (right) of z, i.e., the leftmost point of y is to the right of the rightmost point of z.

If we combine these, we have:
- z [some space] y
- x [some space] y

But this doesn't directly tell us the relative positions of x and z. Let's visualize:
- The gap between z and y is occupied by region O1: (supx(z), infx(y))
- The gap between x and y is occupied by region O2: (supx(x), infx(y))

The regions O1, O2 and y are spatially localized in contiguous x-segments, but the relative positions of O1 and O2 could be any of: O1 is to the left of O2, O1 is to the right of O2, or O1 and O2 overlap.

Given the constraints of "x W y" and "y E z", let me look at the specific definitions again to see if I've missed something:
- "x W y" means that supx(x) <= infx(y) (right edge of x is to the left of left edge of y)
- "y E z" means that supx(z) <= infx(y) (right edge of z is to the left of left edge of y)

These both imply that x and z are to the left of y, but don't diectly tell us the relationship between x and z in the x-direction.

In the y-direction:
- "x W y" means infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (y's y-bounds contain x's y-bounds)
- "y E z" means infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's y-bounds contain y's y-bounds)

Combining these, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This tells us that z's y-bounds contain x's y-bounds.

OK, the possible directions are:
1. x W z: If supx(x) <= infx(z), which is not constrained by the given relations, so this is possible.
2. x NW z: If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first is not constrained, and the second is in tension with our combined constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). The second condition would require z's upper bound to be below x's lower bound, which seems incompatible with infy(z) <= infy(x). So, this doesn't seem possible.
3. x N z: If supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Again, the first condition seems incompatible with infy(z) <= infy(x). So, this doesn't seem possible.
4. x NE z: If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first is not constrained, but the second is in tension with our combined constraint. So, this doesn't seem possible.
5. x E z: If supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first is not constrained, and the other two are consistent with our combined constraint. So, this is possible.
6. x SE z: If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first is not constrained, but the second is in tension with the combined constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). If infy(z) <= infy(x), then it's not possible for supy(x) <= infy(z), because it would mean that supy(x) <= infy(x), contradicting that supy(x) and infy(x) are bounds of the same region x. So, this doesn't seem possible.
7. x S z: If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Again, the first is in tension with our combined constraint. So, this doesn't seem possible.
8. x SW z: If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first is not constrained, but the second is in tension with our combined constraint. So, this doesn't seem possible.
9. x B z: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two are not constrained, and the last two are consistent with our combined constraint. So, this is possible.

So, the possible directions seem to be: W, E, and B.

Hmm, but I'm not convinced of the tension I argued for in dirctions NW, N, NE, etc. I think those were incorrect. Let's think more precisely:

For NW, the condition is:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

The first is not constrained by the given relations. The second requires that z's upper bound is below x's lower bound.

From our combined constraints, we have:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This gives us:
infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

The second condition for NW, which is supy(z) <= infy(x), is incompatible with the derived constraint supy(x) <= supy(z). If supy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(x), which is impossible for the same reason I mentioned.

So, the directions NW, N, and NE don't seem possible because they require x to be to the north of z in some way, which is incompatible with the constraints for "y E z".

Similarly, the directions SW, S, and SE don't seem possible because they require x to be to the south of z, which is incompatible with the given constraints.

I'm coming to the conclusion, again, that the only possible cardinal directions from x to z, given that "x W y" and "y E z", are: W, E, and B.

Let me see if I can construct a concrete example to verify:
- Let y be a region with bounding box [5, 6] × [4, 6].
- For "x W y", x should be to the west of y. Let's place x at [3, 4] × [4.5, 5.5]. This satisfies supx(x) <= infx(y).
- For "y E z", y should be to the east of z. Let's place z at [2, 3] × [3, 7]. This satisfies supx(z) <= infx(y).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x's bounding box: [3, 4] × [4.5, 5.5]
- z's bounding box: [2, 3] × [3, 7]

In the x-direction, x is to the east of z because the rightmost point of z (3) is to the left of the leftmost point of x (3). This is "x E z".

Let's try another example:
- Let y be a region with bounding box [5, 6] × [4, 6].
- For "x W y", place x at [1, 3] × [4.5, 5.5].
- For "y E z", place z at [3, 4] × [3, 7].

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x's bounding box: [1, 3] × [4.5, 5.5]
- z's bounding box: [3, 4] × [3, 7]

In the x-direction, x is to the west of z. This is "x W z".

Now a third example:
- Let y be a region with bounding box [5, 6] × [4, 6].
- For "x W y", place x at [2, 4] × [4.5, 5.5].
- For "y E z", place z at [1, 4] × [3, 7].

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x's bounding box: [2, 4] × [4.5, 5.5]
- z's bounding box: [1, 4] × [3, 7]

In the x-direction, x overlaps with z but is entirely within the bounding box of z in both the x and y directions and is contained within the bounding box of z. This is "x B z".

So the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- x W z
- x E z
- x B z

I think that B does imply west-east overapping of x and z in the single-tile cardinal direction model.

Let's triple-check this. According to the definitions, a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

For x B z, that would mean infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

The last two conditions, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), match our derived constraints. The first two, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), require x to be within the x-bounds of z, which means x and z must overlap in the x-direction.

So, the possible cardinal directions are:
- x W z (west): If x is entirely to the west of z.
- x E z (east): If x is entirely to the east of z.
- x B z (bounding box): If x is within the bounding box of z.

Let me triple check the definitions one more time. This is how the directions are defined:

- a B b iff infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- a S b iff supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- a SW b iff supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
- a W b iff supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- a NW b iff supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
- a N b iff supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- a NE b iff supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
- a E b iff supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- a SE b iff supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Let's explicitly check each direction using these definitions.

For "x W z" to hold, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- From the given constraints, we can only derive that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We're not given enough information to determine if supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x W z is possible.

For "x E z" to hold, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- From the given constraints, we can only derive that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We're not given enough information to determine if supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x E z is possible.

For "x B z" to hold, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- From the given constraints, we can only derive that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We're not given enough information to determine if infx(z) <= infx(x) or if supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x B z is possible.

For "x NW z" to hold, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- From the given constraints, we can derive that infy(z) <= infy(x), which conflicts with the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) (as discussed previously). So, x NW z is not possible.

Similarly, for "x N z", "x NE z", "x SW z", "x S z", and "x SE z", we find constraints that conflict with the information derived from the given "x W y" and "y E z".

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: W, E, and B.

Let me try one more time with a simpler reasoning. Starting from the given cardination direction relations "x W y" and "y E z", I need to deterine the possible relations between x and z.

From "x W y", we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-bounds are within y's y-bounds)

From "y E z", we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the west of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's y-bounds are within z's y-bounds)

Combining these, we have:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Thus, in the y-direction, x's bounds are contained within z's bounds. This rules out the cardinal directions that require disjoint y-bounds: NW, N, NE, SW, S, and SE.

In the x-direction, we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between x and z, so the possible directions are W, E, and B.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- West
- East
- Bounding box

ANSWER:

Looking at the given information:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is E of region z

Let me analyze what each relation tells us:

For "x W y":
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the west of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y's y-extent contains x's y-extent)

For "y E z":
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is completely to the west of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z's y-extent contains y's y-extent)

Combining these constraints:
- Both x and z are to the west of y
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
  (x's y-extent is contained within z's y-extent)

In the x-direction, we know x and z are both west of y, but we don't know their position relative to each other. 

Given all this, the possible relations between x and z are:
W, E, B
