PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Region x is SE of region y.
   - This means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)

2. Region y is B of region z.
   - This means: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z. 

Let's consider each possible relation and check if it's compatible with the given conditions.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the given conditions:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (since x is SE of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (since y is B of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (since y is B of z)

Can x be SE of z? 
We need to check if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From what we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is SE of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is B of z)

This doesn't necessarily imply that supx(z) <= infx(x). It could be that supx(y) < supx(z) <= infx(x), in which case x would be SE of z. But it's also possible that supx(z) > infx(x), in which case x would not be SE of z.

Similarly for the y-coordinate:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is SE of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is B of z)

This doesn't necessarily imply that supy(x) <= infy(z). It could be that supy(x) <= infy(y) < infy(z), in which case x would not be SE of z. But it's also possible that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(z), in which case x could be SE of z.

So, SE is a possible relation between x and z, but not guaranteed.

Let's continue this analysis for all the other possible relations.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

Given:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is SE of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is B of z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is SE of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is B of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is B of z)

For the y-coordinate, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), which doesn't guarantee supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the x-coordinate, supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y) doesn't guarantee infx(z) <= infx(x).

So, S is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Given:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is SE of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is B of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is SE of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is B of z)

For the x-coordinate, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which means infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't guarantee supx(x) <= infx(z). In fact, it seems contradictory, because we'd have infx(z) <= ... <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= infx(z).

So, SW seems to be incompatible with the given conditions.

Actually, let me rethink this. For x to be SE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), which means that the x-coordinates of x are to the east (right) of the x-coordinates of y. And for y to be B of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which means z's bounding box in the x-dimension contains y's.

Let's break this down more systematically.

Given:
1. x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y is B of z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's consider the constraints in the x-dimension:
- From #1: supx(y) <= infx(x), so x is to the right of y.
- From #2: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), so z's x-range contains y's x-range.

Given these, x could be to the right of z (making it E, NE, or SE), or it could overlap with z in the x-dimension (making it B, N, or S). But it can't be entirely to the left of z (W, NW, or SW).

Now, let's consider the constraints in the y-dimension:
- From #1: supy(x) <= infy(y), so x is below y.
- From #2: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), so z's y-range contains y's y-range.

Given these, x could be below z (making it S, SW, or SE), or it could overlap with z in the y-dimension (making it B, E, or W). But it can't be entirely above z (N, NE, or NW).

Combining these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, S, E, and B.

Wait, I need to be more careful with the definition. Let me check each relation:

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From given:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is SE of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is B of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is SE of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is B of z)

It's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x) if z doesn't extend too far to the right. And for the y-coordinate, if infy(z) <= infy(y), then supy(x) <= infy(y) doesn't necessarily imply supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, SE is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For x to be S of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) 
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From given:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is SE of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is B of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is B of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is SE of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is B of z)

For the x-coordinate, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x). It's possible that supx(x) <= supx(z), but it's not guaranteed. And for the y-coordinate, if infy(z) <= infy(y), then supy(x) <= infy(y) doesn't necessarily imply supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, S is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From given:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is SE of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is B of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is SE of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is B of z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is B of z)

For the x-coordinate, we've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
For the y-coordinate, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y), which doesn't guarantee infy(z) <= infy(x). And supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z) implies supy(x) <= supy(z).

So, E is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For x to be B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From given:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is SE of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is B of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is B of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is SE of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is B of z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is B of z)

For the x-coordinate, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x). It's possible that supx(x) <= supx(z), but it's not guaranteed.
For the y-coordinate, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z), which doesn't guarantee infy(z) <= infy(x). And supy(x) <= supy(z) from the above.

So, B is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From given:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is SE of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is B of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is SE of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is B of z)

For the x-coordinate, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which is contradictory to supx(x) <= infx(z). So, SW is not a possible relation.

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've already established that the x-coordinate constraint is contradictory, so W is not a possible relation.

Similarly, NW and N both require supx(x) <= infx(z), which is contradictory. And NE requires supy(z) <= infy(x), which is contradictory to our established constraints.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, S, E, and B.

Actually, let's double-check this. 

Given:
1. x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y is B of z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For the x-coordinate:
- x is to the right of y (because supx(y) <= infx(x))
- y can be anywhere within z's x-range (because infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

For x to be to the left of z (i.e., for W, NW, or SW), we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z). But we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which gives infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This makes supx(x) <= infx(z) impossible.

For the y-coordinate:
- x is below y (because supy(x) <= infy(y))
- y can be anywhere within z's y-range (because infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z))

For x to be above z (i.e., for N, NE, or NW), we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). But we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't give us a clear contradiction for supy(z) <= infy(x). However, if we assume supy(x) < infy(x) (which is reasonable), then supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) gives supy(x) < infy(x) < supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x).

Actually, wait. I'm making an error. infy(x) is the lower bound of x in the y-dimension, and supy(x) is the upper bound. We can't have supy(x) < infy(x) because the upper bound can't be less than the lower bound. So, I need to be more careful with the constraints.

Let's try to visualize this:

1. x is SE of y: This means x is to the right and below y.
2. y is B of z: This means y is completely inside z.

Given that x is to the right and below y, and y is inside z, what can we say about x's position relative to z?

Well, x could be to the right of z (making it E, NE, or SE), or it could partially overlap with z in the x-dimension. Similarly, x could be below z (making it S, SW, or SE), or it could partially overlap with z in the y-dimension.

Let's go through each relation more systematically:

For x to be SE of z:
- x is to the right and below z.

Given that x is to the right and below y, and y is inside z, it's definitely possible for x to be to the right and below z. So, SE is a possible relation.

For x to be S of z:
- x is directly below z, meaning it's within z's x-range but below z's y-range.

Given that x is to the right of y, and y is inside z, it's not guaranteed that x will be within z's x-range. But, it's a possibility. So, S is a possible relation.

For x to be SW of z:
- x is to the left and below z.

But we've established that x is to the right of y, and y is inside z. This means x can't be completely to the left of z. So, SW is not a possible relation.

For x to be E of z:
- x is to the right of z and within z's y-range.

Given that x is to the right of y and below y, and y is inside z, it's possible for x to be to the right of z. But, being within z's y-range is not guaranteed, though it's possible. So, E is a possible relation.

For x to be W of z:
- x is to the left of z and within z's y-range.

But we've established that x can't be completely to the left of z. So, W is not a possible relation.

For x to be NE of z:
- x is to the right and above z.

But we've established that x is below y, and y is inside z. This means x can't be completely above z. So, NE is not a possible relation.

For x to be N of z:
- x is directly above z, meaning it's within z's x-range but above z's y-range.

But we've established that x is below y, and y is inside z. This means x can't be completely above z. So, N is not a possible relation.

For x to be NW of z:
- x is to the left and above z.

But we've established that x can't be completely to the left of z or completely above z. So, NW is not a possible relation.

For x to be B of z:
- x is completely inside z.

Given that x is to the right and below y, and y is inside z, it's possible for x to also be inside z. So, B is a possible relation.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, S, E, and B.

Let's make sure one more time by going through the definition of each:

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

For x to be S of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

For x to be B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given:
1. x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y is B of z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's check each of the candidate relations:

SE: 
- supx(z) <= infx(x): Given supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), it's possible for supx(z) to be less than or equal to infx(x).
- supy(x) <= infy(z): Given supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), it's possible for supy(x) to be less than or equal to infy(z).

S:
- infx(z) <= infx(x): Given infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), one could potentially have infx(z) <= infx(x), especially if z's minimum x-value is close to y's.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): Given the constraints, this is a possibility.
- supy(x) <= infy(z): Same as for SE.

E:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): Same as for SE.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): Given infy(z) <= infy(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), there's no direct relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), so this is a possibility.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): Given supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y) (a general property: the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound), and supy(y) <= supy(z), we have supy(x) <= supy(z).

B:
- infx(z) <= infx(x): Same as for S.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): Same as for S.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): Same as for E.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): Same as for E.

So, all four of these relations (SE, S, E, and B) are possible, and it's consistent with our previous conclusion.

What about other relations?

SW: For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x), making supx(x) <= infx(z) impossible.

W: For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), which is impossible as explained for SW.

NW: For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is impossible as explained.

N: For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). Given supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), there's a possibility that supy(z) > infy(x), making N a potential relation.

Wait, but for x to be N of z, the condition is:
supy(z) <= infy(x)

Given:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is SE of y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is B of z)

For the N relation to hold, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But from the first condition, supy(x) <= infy(y), we can deduce that infy(x) <= supy(x) (this is a general property of bounds). So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y).

And from the second condition, we know supy(y) <= supy(z). Intuitively, given that the upper bound of y is below the upper bound of z and the upper bound of x is below the lower bound of y, it seems likely that the upper bound of x is also below the upper bound of z.

However, this doesn't establish a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). It's still possible for supy(z) to be less than or equal to infy(x), making N a possibility.

But let's examine this more closely. From the conditions, we have:
- infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) (from the condition that x is below y)
- infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from the condition that y is inside z)

Combining these, we get:
infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Which means infy(x) <= supy(z). This doesn't rule out the possibility that supy(z) <= infy(x), but it means the only way for N to be a valid relation is if supy(z) = infy(x).

Actually, from x being SE of y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y), which means x is completely below y. From y being B of z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y), which means the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y.

Combining these, we can say x is completely below y, and z extends below or at the same level as y. This means x is not necessarily entirely below z. So, the N relation is a possibility.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the definition of the N relation again:
For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

For x to be N of z, we need x to be completely above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)) and for x to be within z's x-range.

From the given conditions, x is completely below y (supy(x) <= infy(y)), and z contains y. Since z contains y, and y is above x, we can't have x completely above z. So, the N relation is not possible.

There's a contradiction in my earlier reasoning. Given that x is completely below y, and z contains y, there's no way for x to be completely above z.

NE: For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is possible, but the second condition (supy(z) <= infy(x)) is impossible as explained for N.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, S, E, and B.

Actually, I'm going to double-check by drawing pictures:

Imagine the following setup:

```
   +---+
   | z |
   +---+
   | y |
   +---+
          +---+
          | x |
          +---+
```

Here, x is SE of y, and y is B of z. In this setup, x is SE of z.

Now, let's slightly modify the setup:

```
   +-----+
   |  z  |
   |     |
   |  y  |
   |     |
   +-----+
          +---+
          | x |
          +---+
```

Here, x is still SE of y, and y is B of z. But now, x is SE of z again.

Let's try another setup:

```
   +-----+
   |  z  |
   |     |
   |  y  |
   |     |
   +-----+
       +---+
       | x |
       +---+
```

In this setup, x is SE of y, y is B of z, and x is S of z.

Another one:

```
   +-----+
   |  z  |
   |     |
   |  y  |
   +-----+
       +---+
       | x |
       +---+
```

Here, x is SE of y, y is B of z, and x is S of z again.

One more:

```
   +-----+
   |  z  |
   |     |
   |  y  |
   |     |
   +--+--+
      |  
      +---+
      | x |
      +---+
```

In this setup, x is SE of y, y is B of z, and x is E of z.

And one last one:

```
   +-----+
   |  z  |
   |     |
   |  y  |
   |     |
   |     |
   |  +--+
   |  |x |
   +--+--+
```

Here, x is SE of y, y is B of z, and x is B of z.

It's clear from these examples that the possible relations between x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is B of z, are: SE, S, E, and B.

Let's check if there are any other possibilities.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need x to be to the left of z. But since x is to the right of y (x is SE of y), and y is contained within z (y is B of z), x can't be to the left of z. So, SW is not a possibility.

For x to be W of z, we'd face the same issue as SW: x can't be to the left of z given the constraints. So, W is not a possibility.

For x to be NW of z, we'd need x to be to the left and above z. But as we've established, x can't be to the left of z. Furthermore, since x is below y (x is SE of y), and y is contained within z (y is B of z), x can't be above z. So, NW is not a possibility.

For x to be N of z, we'd need x to be above z. But as just explained, x can't be above z given the constraints. So, N is not a possibility.

For x to be NE of z, we'd need x to be to the right and above z. While x can be to the right of z, it can't be above z given the constraints. So, NE is not a possibility.

So, our conclusion holds: the possible relations between x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is B of z, are: SE, S, E, and B.

Actually, there's another constraint for a region to be B of another: it has to be fully contained within the other. Let me double-check the definition:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means a is inside the minimum bounding box of b, not necessarily fully contained within b. So, the previous conclusion holds.

So my answer is: the possible relations between x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is B of z, are: SE, S, E, and B.

ANSWER:

The question asks for possible relations between region x and region z, given:
1. Region x is SE of region y
2. Region y is B of region z

To determine this, I need to analyze what these relations mean in terms of the spatial constraints:

For x SE of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east/right of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south/below y)

For y B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's bounding box extends at least as far west as y's)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z's bounding box extends at least as far east as y's)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bounding box extends at least as far south as y's)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's bounding box extends at least as far north as y's)

Given these constraints, the possible relations are:
