PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We have:
- x E y (x is East of y)
- y SE z (y is Southeast of z)

We need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

For x E y, according to the definition: 
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x has vertical overlap with y)

For y SE z, according to the definition:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z by combining these constraints.

From x E y and y SE z, we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z
- For the vertical relationship, we have:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
  - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x has vertical overlap with y)

Given these constraints, what can we say about the vertical relationship between x and z?

We know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is above or equal to the bottom of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is below or equal to the top of y)

Combining these:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (the top of x is below the bottom of z)

This implies that x is below z, which corresponds to the S (South) relationship for the vertical component.

Since x is to the east of z and x is below z, the only possible relation between x and z is SE (Southeast).

But let me double-check this reasoning. 

Actually, I've made a mistake.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x has vertical overlap with y)

From y SE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From the x-coordinates, we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z

But for the y-coordinates, it's not as straightforward:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is above or equal to the bottom of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is below or equal to the top of y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means that x is completely below z, which corresponds to the S (South) relationship for the vertical component.

Since x is to the east of z and x is to the south of z, the relation between x and z is SE (Southeast).

But I think I should re-examine this in more detail, considering different possibilities.

From the given conditions:
- x E y: x is to the east of y with vertical overlap
- y SE z: y is to the southeast of z (east and south)

We need to determine the relationship between x and z.

First, from a horizontal perspective:
- Since y is to the east of z and x is to the east of y, x must be to the east of z.

For the vertical relationship, we need to consider the constraints:
- From "y SE z", we know y is below z.
- From "x E y", we have that x vertically overlaps with y, which means x can be anywhere vertically as long as it overlaps with y.

Now, let's consider the different possibilities:

1. If the top of x is below the bottom of z, then x is south of z.
2. If x vertically overlaps with z, then x has an eastern relationship with z.
3. If the bottom of x is above the top of z, then x is north of z.

Let's analyze each of these in more detail:

1. x is south of z:
   - This is possible. x could be positioned such that it overlaps with y vertically and is to the east of y, while also being below z.

2. x overlaps with z vertically:
   - This is also possible. x could overlap with both y and z vertically, while being to the east of both.

3. x is north of z:
   - This is not immediately clear. We know y is to the south of z. If x is above y (which is allowed by the east relation), it could potentially be to the north of z.

Let's break this down more precisely:

From "x E y", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y SE z", we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
So, x is to the east of z.

Combining the vertical constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x has vertical overlap with y)

Now, there are several possible configurations for x vertically:

a. supy(x) <= infy(z): In this case, x is below z, so the relation is SE.
b. infy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z): In this case, x and z overlap vertically with x extending more to the south, so the relation is E.
c. infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z) <= supy(x): In this case, x and z overlap vertically with x extending more to the north, so the relation is E.
d. infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z): In this case, x is within z vertically, so the relation is E.
e. infy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= supy(x): In this case, z is within x vertically, so the relation is E.
f. supy(z) <= infy(x): In this case, x is above z, so the relation is NE.

So, the possible relations between x and z are SE, E, and NE.

But I need to revisit my understanding of the constraints.

From "x E y", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y)

This implies that x vertically overlaps with y, but the top of x is not higher than the top of y and the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of y. In other words, y vertically contains x.

From "y SE z", we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means y is to the southeast of z, which is to the east and south of z.

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
So, x is to the east of z.

Combining the vertical constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y) (y vertically contains x)

Given these constraints, we have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This implies that x is below z, so the vertical relation is S (South).

Since x is to the east of z and x is to the south of z, the relation between x and z is SE (Southeast).

But let me just double-check my reasoning once more.

From "x E y", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y SE z", we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's analyze the x-coordinates:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

So, x is definitely to the east of z.

Let's analyze the y-coordinates:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y) (x is vertically within y)

Now, let's consider the y-coordinate relationship between x and z.

We have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This implies that x is below z. So, the vertical relation is S (South).

Wait, let's be even more precise. From "infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y)", we know that the y-range of x is a subset of the y-range of y, but it's possible that they share boundaries.

Specifically, there are several possible configurations for the y-coordinates of x in relation to the y-coordinates of y:

1. infy(y) < infy(x) AND supy(x) < supy(y): x is strictly within y vertically.
2. infy(y) = infy(x) AND supy(x) < supy(y): x shares the bottom boundary with y but is otherwise within y vertically.
3. infy(y) < infy(x) AND supy(x) = supy(y): x shares the top boundary with y but is otherwise within y vertically.
4. infy(y) = infy(x) AND supy(x) = supy(y): x and y have the same vertical extent.

In all of these configurations, given that supy(y) <= infy(z), it's still the case that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z.

So, the relation between x and z is SE, since x is to the east and south of z.

Actually, I think there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think more carefully.

From "x E y", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y) (x has vertical overlap with y)

From "y SE z", we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
So, x is definitely to the east of z.

Now, for the vertical relation:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not higher than the top of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z, or the top of y is below the bottom of z)

Combining these vertical constraints:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (the top of x is below the bottom of z)

So, the top of x is below the bottom of z, which means x is to the south of z.

Given that x is to the east of z and x is to the south of z, the relation between x and z is SE (Southeast).

So, the answer is SE.

Let me just triple-check this by considering a more visual approach:

Given:
- x E y: x is to the east of y with vertical overlap
- y SE z: y is to the southeast of z (east and south)

Let's draw this out (schematically):

```
     z
      \
       \
        y
         \
          \
           x
```

From this, it's clear that x is to the southeast of z, which aligns with my earlier derivation.

So, the relation between x and z is SE.

Actually, I think I'm still thinking about this too narrowly. Let's revisit the definition of the E relation:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means that region a is to the east of region b and they have some vertical overlap. More specifically, a can't extend vertically beyond b.

Now, let's revisit the SE relation:

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

This means that region a is to the southeast of region b, which is to the east and south of b, with no vertical or horizontal overlap.

Given:
- x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

For the horizontal component:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)

Combining: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

This ensures that x is to the east of z.

For the vertical component:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

Combining: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means that the top of x is below the bottom of z, which implies that x is to the south of z.

Given that x is to the east of z and x is to the south of z, the relation between x and z is SE (Southeast).

So, the answer is SE.

Wait, I think I'm approaching this problem too deterministically. The question asks about the "possible" relations between region x and region z, implying that there might be multiple valid relations.

Let's re-analyze from this angle.

Given:
- x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For the horizontal component:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)

Combining: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

This ensures that x is to the east of z, which satisfies the E, NE, and SE relations.

For the vertical component:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

Combining: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means that the top of x is below the bottom of z, which implies that x is to the south of z, which satisfies the SE, S, and SW relations.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are SE (Southeast), since x is both to the east and south of z.

Hmm, on second thought, I think I was right initially. The relation between x and z is deterministically SE, not a set of possibilities.

Actually, let me think about this from a different angle. Let me try to visualize the constraints and see if there's any wiggle room for the relation between x and z.

From "x E y", we know:
- x is to the east of y
- x vertically overlaps with y, but is contained within y's vertical extent

From "y SE z", we know:
- y is to the southeast of z, which means it's to the east and south of z, with no overlap

Given these constraints, x is to the east of z, and the top of x is below the bottom of z. So, the relation between x and z is SE (Southeast).

However, let's be extremely precise and check if there's any room for other relations.

For x to have a relation other than SE with z:
- For NE: x would need to be to the north of z, which contradicts our vertical constraints.
- For E: x would need to vertically overlap with z, which contradicts our vertical constraints.
- For S: x would need to horizontally overlap with z, which contradicts our horizontal constraints.
- For SW, W, NW, N, B: These would also contradict our derived constraints.

So, the relation between x and z is deterministically SE.

But let's see if I'm missing anything by reconsulting the definitions.

From the definition of "x E y":
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y)

From the definition of "y SE z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we've derived:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (horizontal constraint)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (vertical constraint)

The horizontal constraint ensures that x is to the east of z, which satisfies the eastern component of E, NE, and SE.

The vertical constraint ensures that x is to the south of z, which satisfies the southern component of SE, S, and SW.

Combining these constraints, the only relation that satisfies both the horizontal and vertical constraints is SE.

So, the answer is SE.

Wait, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's approach this in a different way.

Given:
- x E y
- y SE z

We have 9 possible elementary (or single-tile) cardinal direction relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B.

Let's consider each of them as a potential relation between x and z and check if it's consistent with the given constraints.

For x N z:
- For this to be true, infy(x) > supy(z).
- From "y SE z", we know supy(y) <= infy(z).
- From "x E y", we know infy(x) >= infy(y).
- Combining: infy(x) >= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
- These don't directly tell us the relation between infy(x) and supy(z), so N is potentially possible.

Actually, I'm not being precise enough. From "infy(x) >= infy(y)" and "supy(y) <= infy(z)", we can't definitely derive the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

Let's go step by step and check each cardinal direction relation.

For x to be to the NE (northeast) of z:
- x needs to be to the north of z: infy(x) > supy(z)
- x needs to be to the east of z: infx(x) > supx(z)

From the given constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (derived from "y SE z" and "x E y")
- This ensures that x is to the east of z: infx(x) > supx(z), which satisfies the eastern component.
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from "y SE z")
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from "x E y")
- These don't directly tell us the relation between infy(x) and supy(z).

To determine if x can be to the north of z, we need to know if infy(x) > supy(z). Given our constraints, it's possible that infy(x) is greater than supy(z), making NE a possibility.

Actually, wait. Let's be even more precise. From "x E y", we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y SE z", we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means the top of x is below the bottom of z, which means x is to the south of z, not to the north.

So, NE is not possible.

For x to be to the E of z:
- x needs to be to the east of z: infx(x) > supx(z)
- x needs to vertically overlap with z: (infy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= supy(x))

From the derived constraints:
- infx(x) > supx(z) (satisfied)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (which means supy(x) < infy(z))

The vertical overlap condition is not satisfied, so E is not possible.

Continuing this way for all the cardinal directions, I can determine which ones are possible.

For x to be to the SE of z:
- x needs to be to the east of z: infx(x) > supx(z)
- x needs to be to the south of z: supy(x) < infy(z)

From the derived constraints:
- infx(x) > supx(z) (satisfied)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (satisfied)

So, SE is possible.

For x to be to the S of z:
- x needs to horizontally overlap with z: (infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(z) <= supx(x))
- x needs to be to the south of z: supy(x) < infy(z)

From the derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (which means supx(z) < infx(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (satisfied)

The horizontal overlap condition is not satisfied, so S is not possible.

For x to be to the SW of z:
- x needs to be to the west of z: supx(x) < infx(z)
- x needs to be to the south of z: supy(x) < infy(z)

From the derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (which means supx(z) < infx(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (satisfied)

The western component is not satisfied (we have infx(x) > supx(z), which contradicts the west constraint), so SW is not possible.

For x to be to the W of z:
- x needs to be to the west of z: supx(x) < infx(z)
- x needs to vertically overlap with z: (infy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= supy(x))

From the derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (which means supx(z) < infx(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (which means supy(x) < infy(z))

Neither the western component nor the vertical overlap condition is satisfied, so W is not possible.

For x to be to the NW of z:
- x needs to be to the west of z: supx(x) < infx(z)
- x needs to be to the north of z: infy(x) > supy(z)

From the derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (which means supx(z) < infx(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (which means supy(x) < infy(z))

Neither the western component nor the northern component is satisfied, so NW is not possible.

For x to be N of z:
- x needs to horizontally overlap with z: (infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(z) <= supx(x))
- x needs to be to the north of z: infy(x) > supy(z)

From the derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (which means supx(z) < infx(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (which means supy(x) < infy(z))

Neither the horizontal overlap condition nor the northern component is satisfied, so N is not possible.

For x to be B of z:

Wait, I got confused about what B stood for. B refers to the "bounding box" relation, which means x is within the minimum bounding box of z.

For x to be B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (which means supx(z) < infx(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (which means supy(x) < infy(z))

The bounding box conditions are not satisfied, so B is not possible.

Actually, on a reread of the problem statement, the definition of B is not "bounding box" but a relation itself: the "Bounding box" relation. According to the definition:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means a is inside the bounding box of b. With this in mind:

For x to be B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (which means supx(z) < infx(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (which means supy(x) < infy(z))

The bounding box conditions are not satisfied, so B is not possible.

Actually, just in case, let me go back to the definitions provided in the problem. The definition for B is:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means region a is inside the bounding box of region b.

For x to be B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the derived constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (which means supx(z) < infx(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (which means supy(x) < infy(z))

The B relation requires "infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)", but we have "supx(z) < infx(x)" which means infx(x) > supx(z), so the first part infx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied, but the second part supx(x) <= supx(z) is not. So B is not a possible relation.

In summary, after checking all the cardinal direction relations, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

So, the answer is SE.

Actually, hold on. I think I might have been hasty in ruling out NE.

Let's re-analyze.

From "x E y", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y SE z", we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
So, x is to the east of z, which satisfies the eastern component of E, NE, and SE.

For the vertical constraint, I previously derived:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This tells us that the top of x is below the bottom of z, implying that x is to the south of z. But I realized I need to be careful here.

Actually, the constraint supy(x) <= supy(y) doesn't necessarily imply that supy(x) is strictly less than supy(y). It could also be equal. But even if they are equal, given that supy(y) <= infy(z), we'd still have supy(x) <= infy(z), ensuring that x is to the south of z.

For x to be to the north of z (which would support the NE relation), we'd need to have infy(x) > supy(z). But our constraints don't give us any direct information about supy(z).

Let's approach this differently. The vertical constraint we have from "x E y" is:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y)

And from "y SE z", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This clearly tells us that the top of x is below the bottom of z, which means x is to the south of z. So, the NE relation is not possible.

In conclusion, after checking all the cardinal direction relations, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Let me check E one more time.

For x to be to the E of z:
- x needs to be to the east of z: infx(x) > supx(z) ✓
- x needs to vertically overlap with z: (infy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= supy(x))

From our constraints, we have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means the top of x is below the bottom of z, which means there's no vertical overlap between x and z. So, E is not possible.

So, the answer is SE.

Actually, I just realized that I could reformulate the vertical constraint. We have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (1)

For vertical overlap, we need:
- infy(x) <= supy(z) (x's bottom is below z's top) (2)
- infy(z) <= supy(x) (z's bottom is below x's top) (3)

From (1), we know that supy(x) <= infy(z), which is precisely the negation of (3). So, the vertical overlap condition can't be satisfied.

This confirms that E is not a possible relation between x and z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Actually, let me double-check that SE is valid. For SE, we need:
- x needs to be to the east of z: infx(x) > supx(z) ✓
- x needs to be to the south of z: supy(x) < infy(z) ✓

From our constraints, we've established both conditions are met. So, SE is a viable relation.

Let me check S one more time. For x to be to the S of z:
- x needs to horizontally overlap with z: (infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(z) <= supx(x))
- x needs to be to the south of z: supy(x) < infy(z) ✓

From our horizontal constraint:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

So, infx(x) > supx(z), meaning x is to the east of z. But for the S relation, we need either infx(x) <= supx(z) (x's left edge is to the left of z's right edge) or infx(z) <= supx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of x's right edge).

From "y SE z", we know supx(z) <= infx(y), which means z's right edge is to the left of y's left edge. From "x E y", we know infx(x) >= supx(y), which means x's left edge is to the right of y's right edge. Combining, we have: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).

So, we have infx(x) > supx(z), but for the S relation, we need infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(z) <= supx(x).

Since infx(x) > supx(z), the first condition infx(x) <= supx(z) is not satisfied.

For the second condition, infx(z) <= supx(x), we don't have direct constraints on infx(z). However, from "y SE z", we know supx(z) <= infx(y). This doesn't directly tell us about infx(z), but it does ensure that z's right edge is to the left of y's left edge.

If z's right edge (supx(z)) is to the left of y's left edge (infx(y)), and y's right edge (supx(y)) is to the left of x's left edge (infx(x)), then z is entirely to the left of x. This means there's no horizontal overlap between z and x.

So, the S relation is not possible.

Just to be sure, let's check the SW relation once more. For x to be to the SW of z:
- x needs to be to the west of z: supx(x) < infx(z)
- x needs to be to the south of z: supy(x) < infy(z) ✓

From our horizontal constraint:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

So, infx(x) > supx(z), meaning x is to the east of z, not to the west. This contradicts the SW relation.

So, the SW relation is not possible.

After checking all the cardinal direction relations, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

I'm actually going to step back and look at this with a clearer mind. 

Given:
- x E y: x is east of y and vertically overlaps with y.
- y SE z: y is southeast of z (east and south).

From these, I'll determine the possible relations between x and z.

For the horizontal component:
- From "x E y", x is east of y, so the right edge of y is to the left of the left edge of x.
- From "y SE z", y is east of z, so the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of y.
- Combining: The right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of y, and the right edge of y is to the left of the left edge of x. So, the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x, which means x is east of z.

For the vertical component:
- From "x E y", x vertically overlaps with y.
- From "y SE z", y is south of z, meaning the top of y is below the bottom of z.
- Combining: Given that x overlaps vertically with y and y is below z, x must be below z. (To see this, note that the overlap condition says the top of x is below the top of y, which is already below the bottom of z. So, the top of x is below the bottom of z.)

So, x is east of z and south of z, which means x is southeast (SE) of z.

Therefore, the possible relation between x and z is SE.

But wait, let's be clearer about the vertical overlap in the E relation.

From "x E y", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x vertically overlaps with y)

The vertical overlap condition says that the bottom of x is not lower than the bottom of y and the top of x is not higher than the top of y. This means the vertical extent of x is a subset of the vertical extent of y. In other words, x is "vertically contained" within y, though they may share boundaries.

Now, from "y SE z", we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is south of z)

Given that the top of y is below the bottom of z, and the top of x is at most as high as the top of y (from the E relation), we can deduce that the top of x is also below the bottom of z. This means x is south of z.

Combining the horizontal and vertical components, x is east of z and south of z, which means x is southeast (SE) of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

To reiterate:
- x is to the east of z due to the transitive property of the horizontal constraints.
- x is to the south of z because the top of x is below the top of y (from the E relation), which is itself below the bottom of z (from the SE relation).

These combined constraints place x in the southeast region of z, hence the relation is SE.

To summarize, after checking all the cardinal direction relations, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I'll analyze the constraints from the given relations.

Given:
- x is E of y
- y is SE of z

Step 1: Let's analyze what these relations tell us.

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x vertically overlaps with y)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Step 2: Determine the horizontal relationship between x and z.
Combining the relevant constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z.

Step 3: Determine the vertical relationship between x and z.
From the constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means the top of x is below the bottom of z, so x is to the south of z.

Step 4: Combine the horizontal and vertical relationships.
Since x is both east of z and south of z, the only possible relation is SE.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is SE.
