PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

We are asking about transitivity of the cardinal direction relation N (North). Let's analyze the scenario:
- Region x is N of region y. This means $supy(y) \leq infy(x)$, $infx(y) \leq infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \leq supx(y)$.
- Region y is N of region z. This means $supy(z) \leq infy(y)$, $infx(z) \leq infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$.

Now, let's deduce the possible relations between x and z. First, let's check if x must be N of z:

For N relation: we need 
1. $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$
2. $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$
3. $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$

Let's check each condition:
1. We know $supy(z) \leq infy(y)$ and $supy(y) \leq infy(x)$, so $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. This condition is satisfied.
2. We know $infx(z) \leq infx(y)$ and $infx(y) \leq infx(x)$, so $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$. This condition is satisfied.
3. We know $supx(x) \leq supx(y)$ and $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$, so $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$. This condition is satisfied.

Since all three conditions are satisfied, we can conclude that x is N of z. So N is one possible relation.

Now let's check NW relation:
For x to be NW of z, we need:
1. $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$ 
2. $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$

We've already established that $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$, so condition 2 is satisfied.
For condition 1, we know $supx(x) \leq supx(y)$ and $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$. However, this doesn't guarantee $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$. 

Actually, let's be more careful about the NW relation. We need to check if it's possible for x to be NW of z, not if it must be.

Can x be NW of z? Yes, if $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$, which could happen if x is positioned far enough to the west. So NW is a possible relation.

Similarly, let's check NE:
For x to be NE of z, we need:
1. $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$ 
2. $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$

We've already established that $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$, so condition 2 is satisfied.
For condition 1, we know $infx(y) \leq infx(x)$ and $infx(z) \leq infx(y)$, so $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$. But this doesn't guarantee $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$.

But again, we're checking if NE is a possible relation, not if it must be. Can x be NE of z? Yes, if $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$, which could happen if x is positioned far enough to the east. So NE is a possible relation.

Now I'm reconsidering my approach. Let me interpret the question more carefully. We're given two statements: "region x is N of region y" and "region y is N of region z". The question asks for all possible relations between x and z. 

I've established that x must be N of z, based on the definitions. But I'm less sure about whether x can also be NW or NE of z, because the conditions we have don't guarantee it.

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake. Let's reconsider the scenario:

- x is N of y means $supy(y) \leq infy(x)$, $infx(y) \leq infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \leq supx(y)$. This means that x lies entirely to the north of y, with a possible east-west overlap.
- y is N of z means $supy(z) \leq infy(y)$, $infx(z) \leq infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$. This means that y lies entirely to the north of z, with a possible east-west overlap.

Now, for x to be NW of z, we need $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. Given our constraints, we know $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$ (from transitivity of the "north of" relation). But we don't have enough constraints to guarantee $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$. In fact, we know $supx(x) \leq supx(y)$ and $infx(z) \leq infx(y)$, but we can't deduce the relationship between $supx(x)$ and $infx(z)$ directly.

Actually, let's examine this more carefully:

1. x is N of y means x is entirely above y, with x possibly extending as far west as the western edge of y, and as far east as the eastern edge of y.
2. y is N of z means y is entirely above z, with y possibly extending as far west as the western edge of z, and as far east as the eastern edge of z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the possible positions of x relative to z?

We know x is entirely above y, and y is entirely above z, so x is entirely above z. But there are various possible east-west relationships:

1. x can be directly north of z, with x extending as far west as the western edge of z, and as far east as the eastern edge of z.
2. x can be northwest of z, with x entirely to the west of z.
3. x can be northeast of z, with x entirely to the east of z.
4. x can have other intermediate positions: partly northwest and partly north, or partly northeast and partly north.

The given constraints don't uniquely determine the east-west relationship between x and z. So I think the answer is: x can be N, NW, or NE of z.

Actually, wait. Let me read the definitions again and think through this more carefully.

The cardinal direction relations are defined in terms of the projections on the x and y axes. For a region a to be N of a region b, we need:
1. $supy(b) \leq infy(a)$ [a is entirely above b]
2. $infx(b) \leq infx(a)$ [a doesn't extend further west than b]
3. $supx(a) \leq supx(b)$ [a doesn't extend further east than b]

For a region a to be NW of a region b, we need:
1. $supx(a) \leq infx(b)$ [a is entirely to the west of b]
2. $supy(b) \leq infy(a)$ [a is entirely above b]

For a region a to be NE of a region b, we need:
1. $supx(b) \leq infx(a)$ [a is entirely to the east of b]
2. $supy(b) \leq infy(a)$ [a is entirely above b]

Now, in our scenario:
- x is N of y means $supy(y) \leq infy(x)$, $infx(y) \leq infx(x)$, and $supx(x) \leq supx(y)$.
- y is N of z means $supy(z) \leq infy(y)$, $infx(z) \leq infx(y)$, and $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$.

From these, we can deduce:
1. $supy(z) \leq infy(y) \leq supy(y) \leq infy(x)$, so $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. This means x is entirely above z, which is one part of the North relation.
2. $infx(z) \leq infx(y) \leq infx(x)$, so $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$. This means x doesn't extend further west than z, which is another part of the North relation.
3. $supx(x) \leq supx(y) \leq supx(z)$, so $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$. This means x doesn't extend further east than z, which is the final part of the North relation.

Based on these deductions, x can be North of z. But can x be Northwest of z or Northeast of z?

For Northwest, we need $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$, and we've only established $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$. We don't know if $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$.

For Northeast, we need $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$, and we've only established $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$. We don't know if $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$.

So, based on the constraints given, can x be Northwest or Northeast of z? Let's consider:

For x to be NW of z, we need $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. We've established the second condition, but the first requires that the rightmost part of x is to the left of the leftmost part of z. This isn't guaranteed by the constraints given. In fact, the constraints allow for scenarios where x and z have an east-west overlap.

For x to be NE of z, we need $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$ and $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. Similarly, the first condition isn't guaranteed.

So, based on the constraints, x can be North of z, but we can't guarantee that x is Northwest or Northeast of z. The constraints allow for this, but don't guarantee it.

I need to recall: the problem is asking for all possible cardinal direction relations, not just the one that x and z must have.

Let's reconsider. Given the constraints, can x be NW of z? This would mean x is entirely to the west of z and entirely above z. The "entirely above z" part is guaranteed. The "entirely to the west of z" part requires that $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$. Is this possible? Yes, it's possible for x to be positioned in such a way that it's entirely to the west of z, even with the constraints that x is N of y and y is N of z. So NW is a possible relation.

Similarly, for x to be NE of z, x would need to be entirely to the east of z and entirely above z. The "entirely above z" part is guaranteed. The "entirely to the east of z" part requires that $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$. Again, this is possible with the given constraints. So NE is also a possible relation.

In conclusion, based on the constraints "x is N of y" and "y is N of z," the possible relations between x and z are: N, NW, and NE.

However, I want to review this once more to make sure that N is indeed the only possible relation. Let me investigate to check if any other relations like W, E, B etc. could be possible.

For x to be W of z, we would need:
1. $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$ [x is entirely to the west of z]
2. $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$ [x doesn't extend further down than z]
3. $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$ [x doesn't extend further up than z]

From our constraints, we know:
- $supy(z) \leq infy(y) \leq supy(y) \leq infy(x)$
- This means $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$, or in other words, x is entirely above z.

So, $supy(z) < supy(x)$, which contradicts the third condition for the W relation. Thus, x cannot be W of z.

This same argument applies to many other relations, including SW (which requires x to be below and to the west of z) and S (which requires x to be below z). In both cases, the constraints ensure that x is above z, making these relations impossible.

Similarly, for the E, SE, and B relations, the constraints that x is entirely above z would be violated. The NW, N, and NE relations are the only ones that allow x to be entirely above z.

So, based on the constraints "x is N of y" and "y is N of z," the possible relations between x and z are: N, NW, and NE.

Actually, let's check one more time. I realize that I may not have been careful enough. Specifically, let's check if x could be B of z.

For x to be B of z, we would need:
1. $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$ [x's left edge is not to the left of z's left edge]
2. $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$ [x's right edge is not to the right of z's right edge]
3. $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$ [x's bottom edge is not below z's bottom edge]
4. $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$ [x's top edge is not above z's top edge]

From our constraints, we know:
- $supy(z) \leq infy(y) \leq supy(y) \leq infy(x)$
- This means $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$, or in other words, the top edge of z is below the bottom edge of x.

This contradicts the fourth condition for the B relation, which requires that the top edge of x is not above the top edge of z. Since x is entirely above z, it can't be within the bounding box of z.

Thus, x cannot be B of z.

I've now checked all the cardinal directions, and my conclusion remains the same: based on the constraints "x is N of y" and "y is N of z," the possible relations between x and z are: N, NW, and NE.

Actually, let's double-check the definition of "N". For region a to be N of region b, we need:
1. $supy(b) \leq infy(a)$ [a is entirely above b]
2. $infx(b) \leq infx(a)$ [a doesn't extend further west than b]
3. $supx(a) \leq supx(b)$ [a doesn't extend further east than b]

Given our scenario, the condition for x to be N of z would include:
- $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$ [x is entirely above z]
- $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$ [x doesn't extend further west than z]
- $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$ [x doesn't extend further east than z]

From our constraints, we've established that the first bullet is satisfied. Additionally, we've deduced:
- $infx(z) \leq infx(y) \leq infx(x)$, so the second bullet is satisfied.
- $supx(x) \leq supx(y) \leq supx(z)$, so the third bullet is also satisfied.

These deductions confirm that one possible relation is N.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$ [x is entirely to the west of z]
- $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$ [x is entirely above z]

The second condition is guaranteed as we've seen. But the first condition needs the rightmost point of x to be to the left of the leftmost point of z. This isn't guaranteed by the constraints, but it is possible with the constraints.

Similarly, for x to be NE of z, we need:
- $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$ [x is entirely to the east of z]
- $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$ [x is entirely above z]

Again, the second condition is guaranteed, but the first condition needs the rightmost point of z to be to the left of the leftmost point of x. This isn't guaranteed, but is possible with the constraints.

Given the constraints "x is N of y" and "y is N of z," x is guaranteed to be entirely above z. The east-west relationship between x and z can vary: x can be directy north (with an east-west overlap), entirely to the west, or entirely to the east of z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: N, NW, and NE. And we can't have W, SW, B, S, SE, E.

Actually, when I reason about whether x can be NW of z or NE of z, I can try to think about some concrete cases to help clarify.

Suppose we have:
- Region z at (0, 0) - (5, 1) [coordinates: (left, bottom) - (right, top)]
- Region y at (1, 2) - (4, 3) [which is indeed N of z]
- Region x at (2, 4) - (3, 5) [which is indeed N of y]

In this scenario, x is N of z, since it's entirely above z, doesn't extend further west than z, and doesn't extend further east than z.

Now, let's adjust region x to be NW of z:
- Region z at (0, 0) - (5, 1)
- Region y at (1, 2) - (4, 3) [still N of z]
- Region x at (-1, 4) - (0, 5) [entirely to the west and above z, and still N of y]

In this adjusted scenario, x is NW of z (it's entirely to the west and above z), and it's still N of y.

And we can do the same to demonstrate that x can also be NE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NW, and NE.

Let me check once more to make sure those are the only possible relations.

For x to be W of z, we would need:
- $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$ [x is entirely to the west of z]
- $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$ [x doesn't extend further down than z]
- $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$ [x doesn't extend further up than z]

Given our constraints, $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$, meaning x is entirely above z. This contradicts the third condition for the W relation, which requires that x doesn't extend further up than z. Thus, x cannot be W of z.

The same logic can be applied to check other relations like SW, S, SE, E, etc., and each will be ruled out because the constraints ensure that x is entirely above z.

The B relation is also ruled out, as the condition for x to be B of z includes $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$, which contradicts the fact that x is entirely above z.

Therefore, based on the constraints "x is N of y" and "y is N of z," the possible relations between x and z are: N, NW, and NE.

So my final answer is: the possible relations between x and z are N, NW, and NE.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, I'll determine what relations are possible between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y
- y is N of z

For x to be N of y, we have:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

For y to be N of z, we have:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these, we can deduce:
1. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

These three conditions mean x is N of z.

Additionally, x could be:
- NW of z (if x is entirely to the west of z while still being north)
- NE of z (if x is entirely to the east of z while still being north)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NW, NE.
