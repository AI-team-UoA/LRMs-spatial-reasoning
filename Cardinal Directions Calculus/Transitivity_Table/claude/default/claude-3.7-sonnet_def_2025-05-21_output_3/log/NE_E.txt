PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

In this problem, we're dealing with compositional inference for cardinal directions. Let's think step by step.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is E of region z

We want to find: possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall what the relations mean:
- x NE y means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z means supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's analyze what this tells us about the relation between x and z:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y can extend as far south as z or not as far south)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y can extend as far north as z or not as far north)

Let's combine these constraints to infer the relation between x and z:

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
By transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(x)
This means x must be to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
By transitivity: supy(y) <= infy(x)
But we can't directly infer a constraint between infy(z) and infy(x) or between supy(z) and supy(x).

What we know for sure is that:
1. x is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x))
2. We don't have enough information to determine the exact north-south relationship between x and z.

Let's think about the possible cardinal directions where x is to the east of z:
- NE: x is north and east of z
- E: x is directly east of z
- SE: x is south and east of z

We need to check which of these are consistent with our constraints.

For NE:
If x is NE of z, then supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x).
We need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is consistent with our constraints.

From the constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

This gives us: supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
But we can't directly infer whether supy(z) <= infy(x). So NE is a possibility.

For E:
If x is E of z, then supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x).
From the constraints, infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't know the relation between infy(y) and infy(x).
Similarly, we know supy(y) <= supy(z), but we don't know the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).
So, E is a possibility.

For SE:
If x is SE of z, then supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x).
We need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is consistent with our constraints.

From the constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

We can't directly infer whether supy(x) <= infy(z). So SE is a possibility.

Actually, let me look at this again. When we're determining the possible relations between x and z, we're not trying to see which ones are consistent with the constraints (which would be a weaker condition). Rather, we're trying to determine which relations must hold given the constraints.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- infx(y) <= supx(y) (by definition, the infimum of a set is less than or equal to the supremum)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
By transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(x)
This means x must be to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

From these, we can infer:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
This doesn't give us a direct constraint on the relation between infy(x) (or supy(x)) and infy(z) (or supy(z)).

Let's consider a concrete example to gain more insight:

Imagine z is a square centered at the origin, y is a square immediately to the east of z, and x is a square to the northeast of y. In this scenario, x would be to the northeast of z. So, NE is definitely a possibility.

Now, imagine y is a rectangle stretched vertically, so its bottom aligns with the bottom of z and its top aligns with the top of z. If x is to the northeast of y, it could still be directly east of z if it aligns with the top half of z. So, E is also a possibility.

Similarly, if y is a rectangle that aligns with the top half of z, and x is to the northeast of y, then x could be to the southeast of z if it's positioned appropriately. So, SE is another possibility.

What about the relation "NE:E"? This would mean x is in the northeastern and eastern regions of z. Given our constraints, this is possible if x is a region that overlaps both the NE and E regions of z.

Let's reconsider the definition of the cardinal directions:

For NE: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
For E: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

If x is "NE:E" of z, it means part of x is in the NE relation to z and part of it is in the E relation to z.

Actually, we're asked for the possible relations between x and z, so we should consider single-tile relations first.

Given the constraints, the following are possible:
- NE: x is to the northeast of z
- E: x is directly east of z
- SE: x is to the southeast of z

But we should also consider multi-tile relations. Let's check if any other combinations are possible:

For "NE:E" to be the relation between x and z, x would have to span both the NE and E regions of z. This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and there would be points in x directly east of z (not to the north). Given our constraints, this is possible.

For "E:SE" to be the relation, x would span both the E and SE regions of z. This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and there would be points in x directly east of z and others to the southeast. This is also possible.

For "NE:E:SE", x would span all three regions. Given the constraints, this is also possible.

Actually, I realize I'm confused again about the problem. Let's try to interpret it more carefully. We're told:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is E of region z

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's be very precise about the definitions:
- x NE y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
  This means x is strictly to the northeast of y.

- y E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
  This means y is strictly to the east of z, and y's vertical extent is contained within z's vertical extent.

Given these, let's trace through the constraints again.

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
By transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(x)
This means x is strictly to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

From these constraints, we know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
This means that y is strictly to the south of x, and y's top doesn't extend higher than z's top.

But here's the catch: We don't know the relation between infy(x) and infy(z) (or equivalently, between supy(x) and supy(z)). This means x could be:
- Strictly to the north of z (NE relation)
- Partially overlap with z in the vertical direction (E relation)
- Strictly to the south of z (SE relation)

This aligns with our previous conclusions.

Wait, let's make sure that "Region x is NE of region y" means that the entire region x is to the northeast of the entire region y. Similarly for "Region y is E of region z".

If these are single-tile relations, then x NE y means all of x is to the northeast of all of y, not just part of x. And the same for y E z.

Given:
- x NE y (all of x is to the northeast of all of y)
- y E z (all of y is directly east of all of z, within z's vertical extent)

Let's analyze this again:

For the x-coordinate: From x NE y and y E z, as we already established, supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x is strictly to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

From the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x), we know that x is strictly to the north of y.
From the constraints infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we know that y's vertical extent is contained within z's vertical extent.

Again, we don't have a direct constraint between the vertical positions of x and z.

Let's consider a few scenarios to get a better understanding:

1. If y is at the top of z (supy(y) = supy(z)), then from supy(y) <= infy(x), we get supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is to the north of z, so the relation is NE.

2. If y is in the middle of z (infy(z) < infy(y) and supy(y) < supy(z)), then x could be at a height that makes it align partially with the top of z, leading to an E relation.

3. If y is at the bottom of z (infy(y) = infy(z)), then x might still be so high that it's above z, or it might align with the top part of z, or it might even be below the top of z, depending on the exact positions.

Based on these scenarios, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE. But also, x could have a multi-tile relation with z, such as NE:E, E:SE, or NE:E:SE.

Let's try to reason more formally to see if we can rule out any of these possibilities.

For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x), so we need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is consistent with our constraints.

From the constraints, supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)).
But this doesn't tell us directly whether supy(z) <= infy(x) or not. So NE is a possible relation.

For x E z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x), so we need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are consistent with our constraints.

From the constraints, infy(z) <= infy(y). But we don't know the relation between infy(y) and infy(x). So, infy(z) <= infy(x) could be satisfied.
We also know that supy(y) <= supy(z), but, again, we don't have a direct constraint between supy(x) and supy(z).
So, E is also a possible relation.

For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x), so we need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is consistent with our constraints.

From our constraints, supy(y) <= infy(x), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z). These don't directly constrain the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, SE is a possible relation as well.

Now, let's check the multi-tile relations.

For x to have a NE:E relation with z, some part of x would be to the northeast of z, and some part would be directly east. The conditions for this to happen would be:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- There's some overlap in the vertical extent between x and z
- Some part of x is to the north of z

We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x). The other conditions don't contradict our constraints, so NE:E is a possible relation.

Similarly, for x to have an E:SE relation with z, the conditions would be:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- There's some overlap in the vertical extent between x and z
- Some part of x is to the south of z

Again, these don't contradict our constraints, so E:SE is a possible relation.

Finally, for x to have a NE:E:SE relation with z, the conditions would be:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- x spans from below the bottom of z to above the top of z

As before, these don't contradict our constraints, so NE:E:SE is a possible relation.

Wait, actually I'm confused again. The problem is asking for possible relations, which means we should limit ourselves to definite possibilities given the constraints. We're not trying to check if certain relations are consistent with the constraints (which would be a weaker condition).

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For the x-coordinate, by transitivity, we get supx(z) <= infx(x). This is a definite constraint.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

From these, the only direct constraint between x and z is that if y's top aligns with z's top (supy(y) = supy(z)), then x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)). But if y's top is below z's top, we don't have a direct constraint on the vertical relationship between x and z.

Let's reason using scenarios again, but more methodically this time:

For x to have a NE relation with z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
From the constraints, we have supy(y) <= infy(x). If supy(y) = supy(z), then we'd have supy(z) <= infy(x), confirming the NE relation. But if supy(y) < supy(z), we don't have a direct constraint. So, NE is a possible relation, but it's not guaranteed.

For x to have an E relation with z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
From the constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). We also have supy(y) <= infy(x), which means y is to the south of x. But if infy(x) is positioned just right, x could have a vertical overlap with z, resulting in an E relation. So, E is a possible relation but it's not guaranteed.

For x to have a SE relation with z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
From the constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). These don't directly constrain the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, SE is a possible relation, but it's not guaranteed.

Similarly for the multi-tile relations.

It seems that the answer to the question "What are the possible relations between x and z?" is that any of NE, E, SE, NE:E, E:SE, or NE:E:SE is possible, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

But I need to keep in mind the limitations of the problem. I shouldn't list relations that require x to be in multiple tiles if the problem is only asking about single-tile relations. Let me re-read the problem.

The prompt mentions cardinal direction relations that can involve multiple tiles, like "R1: ... : Rk", and the question asks for possible relations between x and z, which could be one or more of the 9 single-tile relations. So, my answer should list all possible relations, both single-tile and multi-tile.

Given our analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, SE, NE:E, E:SE, and NE:E:SE.

Actually, I need to be more careful in my analysis. I've been thinking of "possible" as "can happen in some configuration", but I need to check if there are configurations where other relations can also happen.

Let's think again. The only definite constraint we have between x and z is that x is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)). This rules out the relations B, S, SW, W, and NW.

For the north-south relationship, we need to be more precise.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x), we know that y is to the south of x. From the constraint supy(y) <= supy(z), we know that y's top doesn't extend higher than z's top. This means that the top of y is at most as high as the top of z, and x is to the north of y. 

Now, if the top of y aligns with the top of z (supy(y) = supy(z)), then from supy(y) <= infy(x), we get supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is to the north of z. In this case, the relation would be NE.

But if the top of y is below the top of z (supy(y) < supy(z)), we don't have a direct constraint on the vertical relationship between x and z. Depending on the exact positions, x could:
- Be entirely to the north of z (NE relation)
- Overlap with z in the vertical direction (E relation)
- Be entirely to the south of z (SE relation)
- Span multiple regions (like NE:E, E:SE, or NE:E:SE)

Similarly, from the constraint infy(z) <= infy(y), we know that the bottom of y is at least as high as the bottom of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the north of y, this gives us some constraints.

If the bottom of y aligns with the bottom of z (infy(z) = infy(y)), and if x is just slightly to the north of y, then x could be to the southeast of z (if x's top is below z's bottom). So, SE is indeed a possible relation. However, this requires quite specific configurations, so I want to check if this is actually possible by drawing it out.

z:
|---------|
|         |
|---------|

y (to the east of z, aligned at the bottom):
          |---|
          |   |
          |---|

x (to the northeast of y):
              |---|
              |   |
              |---|

In this configuration, x is to the east of z but not necessarily to the northeast or southeast. It depends on the vertical extent of x and z.

If x is higher up, it could be to the northeast of z. If x is at the right height, it could be directly east of z. If x is lower down, it could be to the southeast of z.

So, the relations NE, E, and SE are all possible for specific configurations. Moreover, if x spans multiple regions (like NE:E, E:SE, or NE:E:SE), those are also potential relations.

Given our analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, SE, NE:E, E:SE, and NE:E:SE.

Actually, I realized I need to revisit the definition of NE from the problem statement again:

a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

This means that for x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established supx(z) <= infx(x), but we're trying to determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) is guaranteed, possible, or impossible given the constraints.

From the constraints, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). These only guarantee that supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)).

If supy(y) = supy(z), then we'd have supy(z) <= infy(x), which would give us the NE relation. But if supy(y) < supy(z), we don't have a direct constraint on whether supy(z) <= infy(x). So, NE is a possible relation, but it's not guaranteed.

Similarly, for the E and SE relations (and the multi-tile relations), we'd need to check if the required constraints are guaranteed, possible, or impossible given our conditions. I've already determined that they are possible but not guaranteed.

I stand by my analysis: Given the constraints that x is NE of y and y is E of z, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, SE, NE:E, E:SE, and NE:E:SE.

But thinking about this again, I should double-check if a relation N is possible. For x to have a N relation with z, the bounding box of x would have to directly to the north of the bounding box of z, which means:
infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x doesn't extend beyond z's boundary in the east-west direction)
supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is strictly to the north of z)

We know that supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y). By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(x), which guarantees the second part of the E-W constraint for N. But we don't have a constraint that guarantees infx(z) <= infx(x). In fact, the constraints would allow for infx(x) < infx(z), which would violate the first part of the E-W constraint for N.

So, N is not a possible relation between x and z.

Let me verify this with some examples:

1. If z, y, and x are all unit squares, with y directly to the east of z and x to the northeast of y, then x would be to the northeast of z. This confirms NE as a possible relation.

2. If z extends high enough, and x is positioned correctly, x could align with z in the vertical direction, making E a possible relation.

3. If z extends very high, x could even be to the southeast of z, making SE a possible relation.

4. If x is large enough, it could span multiple regions relative to z.

So, my answer of NE, E, SE, NE:E, E:SE, and NE:E:SE as possible relations stands.

Actually, hold on. I think even North (N) could be possible. Given our constraints, the only direct constraint between x and z in terms of east-west positioning is supx(z) <= infx(x). But this doesn't rule out the possibility that infx(x) <= supx(z), which would mean x and z overlap in the east-west direction.

Let me sketch this out:

z:
  |---------|
  |         |
  |---------|

y (to the east of z):
            |-----|
            |     |
            |-----|

x (to the northeast of y):
                |-----|
                |     |
                |-----|

In this configuration, x is to the northeast of y, and y is to the east of z. But it doesn't seem like x can be directly to the north of z. The only constraint we have is that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.

So, I think N is not a possible relation, and I'll revert to my previous list of possible relations: NE, E, SE, NE:E, E:SE, and NE:E:SE.

Now, let's simplify and focus on the question: "If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

Based on the constraints and our analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, SE, NE:E, E:SE, and NE:E:SE.

Actually, I just realized it says I should not list relations that can be inferred, such as NE:E, E:SE, and NE:E:SE. Let me recheck if this is stated somewhere. Actually, looking at the problem statement, it just asked for the possible answer, which can be one or many of the 9 single-tile relations N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B. So I should only include:

NE, E, SE

Let me double-check this to be sure. Actually the problem defines a cardinal direction relation as an expression R1: ... : Rk, where R1,...,Rk belongs to the set of 9 single-tile relations {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. So composite relations like NE:E, E:SE, and NE:E:SE are allowed. So my answer should include:

NE, E, SE, NE:E, E:SE, NE:E:SE

Actually, I don't think my current answer is correct either. Let me reconsider the problem from first principles.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

The constraint supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z) combined with supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y) gives us supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x is to the east of z (in terms of their bounding boxes). So, the relations B, S, SW, W, NW, N are definitely ruled out.

The remaining possibilities are: NE, E, SE, NE:E, E:SE, NE:E:SE.

Let's check each:

For NE:
We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We already have supx(z) <= infx(x), and from the constraints supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we can infer that if supy(y) = supy(z), then supy(z) <= infy(x), making NE a possible relation. But this is a specific condition. We have a direct constraint that guarantees x is to the east of z, but we don't have a direct constraint guaranteeing x is to the north of z. So, NE is a possible relation, but it requires a specific configuration.

For E:
We need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We already have supx(z) <= infx(x). The other constraints don't guarantee that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are satisfied, but they also don't rule out the possibility. So, E is a possible relation with the right configuration.

For SE:
We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We already have supx(z) <= infx(x). The other constraints don't guarantee that supy(x) <= infy(z) is satisfied, but they also don't rule out the possibility. So, SE is a possible relation with the right configuration.

For NE:E, E:SE, and NE:E:SE, they are composite relations that can be satisfied under specific configurations given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z based on our constraints are:
NE, E, SE, NE:E, E:SE, NE:E:SE.

Actually, wait. The problem statement specifies conditions for a cardinal direction relation to be an expression R1: ... : Rk. One of those conditions is: "there are regions a1, ..., ak ∈ REG, where a1 ∈ R1(b), ..., ak ∈ Rk(b) and a1 ∪ ... ∪ ak ∈ REG for any reference region b ∈ REG."

If I now think about how the problem is asking "which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", I think the problem is asking for the single-tile relations that are possible given the constraints. If the problem wanted the composite relations as well, it would likely have phrased it as such.

But I'm not entirely sure. For clarity, let me go with my original answer: The possible relations between x and z based on our constraints are NE, E, and SE. Then I will point out that composite relations NE:E, E:SE, and NE:E:SE are also possible.

Actually, let's look at the problem statement: "The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B."

It seems the problem is asking for the single-tile relations. But also, it's possible to have a composite relation if needed. But I'm not sure if I'm expected to provide composite relations.

Let me think about this again. If I have a region `a` that has a relation `NE:E` with region `b`, then there's a region a1 such that a1 NE b, and a region a2 such that a2 E b, and a = a1 ∪ a2. But this doesn't mean that a has a relation "NE:E" with b. The relation a has with b is the relation of the bounding box of a with the bounding box of b, not the union of the relations of the parts of a with b.

For example, if a1 is to the northeast of b and a2 is to the east of b, then the bounding box of a = a1 ∪ a2 would encompass both a1 and a2. The relation of this bounding box with b would be the relation describing the positioning of this bounding box with respect to b's bounding box.

So, it seems I need to determine the possible relations of the bounding box of x with the bounding box of z, given our constraints.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- The vertical relationship between x and z is not directly constrained

Based on this, the possible relations for the bounding box of x with the bounding box of z are: NE, E, and SE.

But note: The way the problem defines the cardinal direction relations (with the R1: ... : Rk formalism) is not the composite of the relation of a's bounding box with b's bounding box. These cardinal direction relations are based on the partition of the 2D space relative to a reference region, where a region can span multiple tiles in this partitioning.

But in the specific context of our problem, given the constraints and the question asked, it seems the focus is on the possible single-tile relations between x and z. And these would be:

NE, E, and SE.

Actually, reading the problem statement again, it says:

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: [...conditions...]"

It's describing composite cardinal direction relations of the form R1: ... : Rk.

Then the problem asks about the "possible relations between region x and region z" and specifies that the possible answer can be one or many of the 9 single-tile relations.

I'm interpreting this to mean that we should identify which single-tile relations (out of the 9) can be possible given our constraints.

So, my final answer would be: NE, E, SE are the possible single-tile relations between x and z given the constraints.

Hmm, it's a bit contradictory. One the one hand, it defines that cardinal direction relations can be composite (R1: ... : Rk). But then it asks for the possible relation, which can be "one or many of" the 9 single-tile relations. It doesn't clarify whether it's asking for single-tile, composite, or both types of relations.

For clarity, I'll provide a comprehensive answer:

Given the constraints that x is NE of y and y is E of z, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are:
NE, E, SE

If we consider composite relations, then additional possibilities are:
NE:E, E:SE, NE:E:SE

But based on the wording "one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B", I'm leaning towards the single-tile relations as the desired answer.

Actually, let me think about this again. The "possible answer" refers to the answer to the question, not to the relation. So the question is asking about the possible relations (which could be single-tile or composite), and the answer could involve one or more of the listed single-tile relations.

Given the constraints x NE y and y E z, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are:

NE, E, SE

And if we consider composite relations, the possible composite relations are:

NE:E, E:SE, NE:E:SE

Actually, let's look at how single-tile cardinal direction relations are defined:
1. a B b if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
2. a S b if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
3. a SW b if supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
4. a W b if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
5. a NW b if supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
6. a N b if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
7. a NE b if supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
8. a E b if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
9. a SE b if supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now, I have the constraints:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x), supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

I want to use these to check which of the above relations are possible for the relationship between x and z. I've already established that e is to the east of z, which rules out all the relations except for NE, E, and SE. Let's double check these.

For x NE z, I need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

I have supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y), which gives me supx(z) <= infx(x). 
I don't directly have supy(z) <= infy(x), but I do have supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y). If supy(y) = supy(z), then I would have supy(z) <= infy(x). But if supy(y) < supy(z), I can't guarantee supy(z) <= infy(x). So, NE is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For x E z, I need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

I have supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), which gives me supx(z) <= infx(x).
For infy(z) <= infy(x), I have infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z), but no direct constraint relating infy(y) to infy(x).
For supy(x) <= supy(z), I don't have a direct constraint.
So, E is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For x SE z, I need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

I have supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), which gives me supx(z) <= infx(x).
For supy(x) <= infy(z), I have infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y). But these don't directly constrain the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
So, SE is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

That's consistent with what I've determined: NE, E, and SE are the possible single-tile relations between x and z given the constraints. They're not all guaranteed, but each can hold for specific configurations.

If I look at the list in the problem statement, it says " The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B." So the expected answer is a list of single-tile relations.

So my final answer is: NE, E, SE.

Note: I'm considering the "possible relations" to be the ones that can occur given the constraints, not the ones that are guaranteed. There's no single relation that's guaranteed, but NE, E, and SE are all possible under specific configurations.

Ok, I'm final answer is: NE, E, SE.

ANSWER:

To solve this cardinal direction problem, I need to trace the relationships step by step.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is E of region z

From the definitions:
- x NE y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y E z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For the east-west relationship:
- From y E z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- From x NE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- By transitivity: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

This means x must be to the east of z, ruling out B, S, SW, W, NW, and N.

For the north-south relationship:
- We know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)
- We know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is vertically contained within z)
- But we cannot definitively determine the vertical relationship between x and z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
NE, E, SE
