PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step. We're given that:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is W of region z

And we need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z.

I need to use the definitions of cardinal direction relations to figure this out. According to the definitions:

- x NW y means: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  This means x is completely to the left of y (x's rightmost bound is to the left of y's leftmost bound) and completely above y (y's topmost bound is below x's bottommost bound).

- y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
  This means y is completely to the left of z (y's rightmost bound is to the left of z's leftmost bound) and y is vertically within the range of z (y's vertical range is contained within z's vertical range).

Now, I need to determine what these two relationships together imply about the relationship between x and z.

From x NW y, we know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y W z, we know:
3. supx(y) <= infx(z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- From 1 and 3, by transitivity: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is completely to the left of z.
- From 2 and 4, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). By transitivity, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This means infy(z) <= infy(x).
- From 2 and 5, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

So the key constraints we have for the relationship between x and z are:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z)

But we're missing a constraint on the relative positions of the top boundaries. So there's some ambiguity in the vertical relationship.

Given these constraints, let's check which cardinal direction relations could be possible:

1. **x NW z**: This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). 
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but we only know infy(z) <= infy(x), not supy(z) <= infy(x).
   If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x NW z is possible.

2. **x W z**: This means supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't have information about supy(x) and supy(z).
   If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x W z is possible.

3. **x SW z**: This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but we also know infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Therefore, x SW z is not possible.

Let's continue checking the remaining cardinal directions:

4. **x N z**: This means supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x).
   Therefore, x N z is not possible.

5. **x NE z**: This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
   Therefore, x NE z is not possible.

6. **x E z**: This means supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
   Therefore, x E z is not possible.

7. **x SE z**: This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
   Therefore, x SE z is not possible.

8. **x S z**: This means supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x).
   Therefore, x S z is not possible.

9. **x B z**: This means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x).
   Therefore, x B z is not possible.

So the possible relations are x NW z and x W z, but it depends on the specific configurations.

Wait, let's be more careful with the analysis. Let me redo it.

From x NW y, we know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y W z, we know:
3. supx(y) <= infx(z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- From 1 and 3, by transitivity: supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is completely to the left of z.
- From 2 and 4, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This doesn't directly relate infy(x) and infy(z), so there's flexibility in the vertical relationship.
- From 2 and 5, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't directly relate infy(x) and supy(z).

The only definitive conclusion is that x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)). This is consistent with x being in one of the western tiles relative to z: NW, W, or SW. However, the vertical relationship is ambiguous, so we need to check all three.

Let's check if x can be NW of z:
- NW requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
- We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but we don't know if supy(z) <= infy(x).
- Given the constraints, it's possible for x to be NW of z if supy(z) <= infy(x).

Let's check if x can be W of z:
- W requires: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but we don't have direct constraints on the other two.
- Given the constraints, it's possible for x to be W of z if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's check if x can be SW of z:
- SW requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but we don't know if supy(x) <= infy(z).
- Given the constraints, it's possible for x to be SW of z if supy(x) <= infy(z).

Given the information, all three western tiles (NW, W, SW) seem possible for the relationship between x and z.

Actually, hold on. Let me re-approach this. I think I've been overly conservative.

From x NW y, we know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y W z, we know:
3. supx(y) <= infx(z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's see if we can derive a more precise relationship between x and z.

From 1 and 3, we have supx(x) <= infx(z).
From 2 and 4, we get supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). By transitivity, supy(y) >= supy(y), which is a tautology. So we don't get a clear relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) from these.
From 2 and 5, we get supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't give us a clear relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

Ok, what I think this means is that, relative to z, region x could be in the NW, W, or SW direction. That's because the only definitive conclusion is that x is to the left of z, which is consistent with all these directions.

Now, let's visualize the constraints to check:

For x NW y, the situation is:
```
 x
    y
```

For y W z, the situation is:
```
      z
   y  z
      z
```

So, combining, we get:
```
 x     z
 x  y  z
 x     z
```

This is a very rough visualization, but we are visualizing three regions, where x is fully to the left of y (and above it), and y is fully to the left of z. The vertical relationship between x and z is less constrained, allowing for various possibilities. So x can indeed be NW, W, or SW of z, depending on the specific vertical positions.

Wait, I'm making an error in my analysis. Let me reconsider the constraints more carefully:
From 1 and 3, we know supx(x) <= infx(z).
From 2 and 4, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y).

But I think supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y) tells us more than I initially thought. It doesn't directly compare infy(x) and infy(z), but it sets a constraint on how they relate. Let's think about it more carefully.

We know supy(y) <= infy(x), which means y is completely below x. Also, infy(z) <= infy(y), which means the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me understand the infy and supy notation more clearly first:

- infy(r) is the greatest lower bound of the projection of region r on the y-axis. In other words, it's the minimum y-value of the region.
- supy(r) is the least upper bound of the projection of region r on the y-axis. In other words, it's the maximum y-value of the region.

So if infy(z) <= infy(y), it means the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y.

If supy(y) <= infy(x), it means the top of y is below or at the same level as the bottom of x.

Actually, I've been mistakenly thinking of the y-axis as pointing downwards (like in some computer graphics setups). But in Cartesian coordinates, the y-axis points upwards. Let me reinterpret the constraints:

- If infy(r) is the minimum y-value and supy(r) is the maximum y-value, then:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) means y is completely below x.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) means the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y.

So, from 2 and 4, we have a chain of inequalities: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). By transitivity, infy(z) <= infy(x).

Additionally, from 2 and 5, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)), but it doesn't give us a direct relation between infy(x) and supy(z).

So, the constraints are:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)

Let's check the NW, W, and SW relations:

- NW requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We're not sure about the second part.
- W requires: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know the first two, but not the third.
- SW requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We know the first but not the second.

Let me visualize the constraints:
```
        +
infy(x) +   x x x
        +
        +
supy(y) +
        +           z z z
infy(y) +       y   z z z
        +       y   z z z
infy(z) +           z z z
        +
        +---------------+
          infx(y) supx(y)
          infx(x) supx(x)
                   infx(z) supx(z)
```

In the above, the x-axis is horizontal (increasing from left to right) and the y-axis is vertical (increasing from bottom to top).

Hmm, from my visualization, it seems x can be either NW or W to z, not SW.

Actually, wait. From the problem statement, we're told that x NW y means that x is completely to the left of y AND completely above y. And y W z means y is completely to the left of z. 

There's no constraint that y must be above z, below z, or at the same vertical level as z. But the definition of West says:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

This means a must be completely to the left of b, but also that a must be vertically within the range of b. The bottom of a must be above or at the same level as the bottom of b, and the top of a must be below or at the same level as the top of b.

Let me think about this again:

From x NW y, we know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y W z, we know:
3. supx(y) <= infx(z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z)

From 1 and 3, we have supx(x) <= infx(z).
From 2 and 4, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). By transitivity, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). So infy(z) <= infy(x).
From 2 and 5, we get supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

So the constraints are:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)

Let's check the NW, W, and SW relations:

- NW requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- W requires: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- SW requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

Let me see if we can make more precise claims based on the constraints:

From 2 and 5, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means supy(y) is a lower bound for both infy(x) and supy(z). But it doesn't tell us which of infy(x) and supy(z) is greater. 

So based on the constraints:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)

We can determine:
- x can be NW of z if supy(z) <= infy(x).
- x can be W of z if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- x cannot be SW of z because this requires supy(x) <= infy(z), but we know infy(z) <= infy(x), so supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) would imply supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction.

Actually, I'm making an error in the constraint checks for w. Let's check again:

- W requires: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- We know supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x).
- But we don't know if supy(x) <= supy(z).

So x can be W of z if supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's revisit the SW case:

- SW requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
- We know supx(x) <= infx(z).
- But can supy(x) <= infy(z)? We also know infy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction because the top of a region must be above its bottom. So x cannot be SW of z.

So x can be NW or W of z, depending on the specific configurations.

Let's check the other directions just to be sure:

- N requires: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So x cannot be N of z.

- NE requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
  We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= supx(z). This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So x cannot be NE of z.

- E requires: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So x cannot be E of z.

- SE requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
  We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So x cannot be SE of z.

- S requires: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So x cannot be S of z.

- B requires: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So x cannot be B of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are NW and W.

Actually, let me double check the visualization again. I'll draw it a bit differently, focusing on the minimum bounding boxes of the regions.

Here's how x NW y looks:
```
+-------+
|   x   |
+-------+
          +-------+
          |   y   |
          +-------+
```
The key constraints from x NW y are:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is completely to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is completely above y)

And here's how y W z looks:
```
            +-------+
            |       |
+-------+   |   z   |
|   y   |   |       |
+-------+   +-------+
```
The key constraints from y W z are:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (the top of y is below or at the same level as the top of z)

Combining the two, but still keeping the constraints, the overall picture could look like:
```
+-------+
|   x   |
+-------+
          +-------+    +-------+
          |   y   |    |       |
          +-------+    |   z   |
                       |       |
                       +-------+
```

From this visualization, it's clear that x is completely to the left of z (because x is to the left of y, and y is to the left of z). However, the vertical relationship between x and z can be more complex, depending on the specific vertical positions of the regions.

I can see that it's possible for the top of z to be above the bottom of x, which would rule out the NW relation. It's also possible for the top of x to be above the top of z, which would rule out the W relation. But without specific information on these vertical relationships, both NW and W seem possible.

Let me try once more to use the known constraints to dertimin precisely which relationships are possible.

From x NW y, we know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y W z, we know:
3. supx(y) <= infx(z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z)

From 1 and 3, we have supx(x) <= infx(z).
From 2 and 4, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This gives us a chain infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x). This says that the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x.
From 2 and 5, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This didn't give an immediate transitive relation because the directions of the inequalities don't align.

We know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)

Let's be a bit more systematic. Looking at our constraints:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) tells us that x is completely to the left of z.
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) tells us that the minimum y-value of z is less than or equal to the minimum y-value of x. This is saying the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x.

With just these two constraints, there's flexibility in the vertical positions of the regions, especially the tops of the regions.

Since x is completely to the left of z, the possible cardinal direction relations are: NW, W, and SW.

Let's check each:

**NW**: For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but we don't know if supy(z) <= infy(x). It's possible for the top of z to be below the bottom of x, making x NW of z. But it's also possible for the top of z to be above the bottom of x, making NW impossible. So, NW is possible.

**W**: For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know the first two, but we don't know if supy(x) <= supy(z). It's possible for the top of x to be below the top of z, making x W of z. But it's also possible for the top of x to be above the top of z, making W impossible. So, W is possible.

**SW**: For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but we also know infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= supy(x) (since a region's minimum y-value is always less than or equal to its maximum y-value). So, supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= supy(x) would be true only if supy(x) = infy(z), which is a very specific condition. It's a borderline case, but in general, it's more accurate to say that SW is not a typical relation.

Actually on this "borderline case," we've been told the regions we're dealing with have a specific shape:

"Let us consider regions that are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk {(x, y): x^2 + y^2 <= 1}. The set of these regions will be denoted by REG. Regions in REG are closed, connected and have connected boundaries."

So we're dealing with topologically disk-like regions. And it says "a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)". Given the disk-like nature, a typical region would have a non-zero area, which would make supy(x) = infy(z) unlikely. So I think it's accurate to say that SW is not possible under typical conditions with the kinds of regions we're considering.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are NW and W.

Before I finalize, let me double check my understanding of the region relations and the constraints.

For x NW y, the constraints are:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): The rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y.
- supy(y) <= infy(x): The topmost point of y is below the bottommost point of x.

For y W z, the constraints are:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y): The bottommost point of z is below or at the same level as the bottommost point of y.
- supy(y) <= supy(z): The topmost point of y is below or at the same level as the topmost point of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): From the transitivity of supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
- infy(z) <= infy(x): From the chain infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).

Let's double check the NW and W relations from our understanding and check if anything was wrong:

- For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've established) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is uncertain given our constraints).

Wait, I might have made an error earlier when concluding infy(z) <= infy(x). Let me trace it back.

From x NW y, we have:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y W z, we have:
3. supx(y) <= infx(z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z)

From 2 and 4, we get two constraints: supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). These don't directly give us a transitive constraint. It's not accurate to say infy(z) <= infy(x) just from these.

Let's visualize the y-coordinates to make this clearer:

```
infy(x) ---------- (bottom of x)
         |
         |
         |
supy(y) ---------- (top of y)
         |
         |
infy(y) ---------- (bottom of y)
         |
         |
infy(z) ---------- (bottom of z)
```

This visualization is just one possible scenario, not the only one. But it shows that it's possible for infy(z) to be below infy(x).

Let's trace the constraints and check again:

- supx(x) <= infx(z): x is to the left of z.
- There's no definitive constraint on the vertical relationship between x and z based solely on the given relations.

So, based on these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), and there's no constraint from the given relations that rules this out.

For x to be W of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, there's no constraint from the given relations that rules these out.

For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), and there's no constraint from the given relations that rules this out.

In fact, I don't think any of the constraints rule out any of the three western directions. All of NW, W, and SW could be possible from the given constraints.

Actually, I've been going back and forth a bit. Let me try deriving more definitive conclusions. Let me re-assess the constraints.

From x NW y, we have:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y W z, we have:
3. supx(y) <= infx(z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z)

From 1 and 3, by transitivity, we have supx(x) <= infx(z).
From 2 and 4, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). We can't directly derive a relation using transitivity because the directions don't align.
From 2 and 5, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). We can't directly derive a relation using transitivity for the same reason.

Let's use a visualization to help:

```
      x
        
        y
            z
```
In this very simplified 2D representation, we placed x in the NW of y and y in the W of z. This gives us the constraint that x is to the left of z (as we've already derived), but the vertical relationship between x and z is not directly constrained.

Given that x is to the left of z, the possible cardinal direction relations are NW, W, and SW.

NW: x is to the left and above z. This is possible if the top of z is below the bottom of x.
W: x is to the left and vertically aligned with z. This is possible if the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x, and the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z.
SW: x is to the left and below z. This is possible if the top of x is below the bottom of z.

Let's check if there's any other constraint that would rule out any of these directions.

What would rule out NW?
If we knew that the top of z was above the bottom of x, then NW would be ruled out. From the given constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This implies that the top of y is below both the bottom of x and the top of z. But it doesn't give a direct relation between the bottom of x and the top of z. So, NW remains a possibility.

What would rule out W?
If the bottom of z was above the bottom of x or if the top of x was above the top of z, then W would be ruled out. From the constraints, we can't deduce either of these, so W remains a possibility.

I realize I made an error earlier when I stated infy(z) <= infy(x), which is not directly derivable from the given constraints.

What would rule out SW?
If the top of x was above the bottom of z, then SW would be ruled out. There's no direct constraint from the given relations that rules this out, so SW remains a possibility.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW.

Ok, let me have one final look at this and make sure I am thinking about this properly.

supy(y) <= infy(x) means that the top of y is below the bottom of x, i.e., y is strictly below x.
infy(z) <= infy(y) means that the bottom of z is below or equal to the bottom of y.

We can combine to get a chain: infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x). Since my boundary is strictly less than the top boundary (for a non-empty region), we can definitely say infy(z) < infy(x). But this isn't a constraint that helps distinguish between NW, W, and SW, so the answer is still the same.

But let me reconsider the constraints of the W relation to be sure: for x W z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Actually infy(z) <= infy(x) is not derivable from the given constraints. We have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), which give infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x). But we can't say infy(z) <= infy(x) because we only know infy(z) <= infy(y), not infy(z) <= supy(y).

Actually, hold on. We're dealing with regions, and for a region, its infimum y boundary is always less than or equal to its supremum y boundary. In other words, infy(y) <= supy(y). So, the chain now looks like infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). By transitivity, infy(z) <= infy(x).

Similarly, for the NW relation, we need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). From these, we can't derive a clear relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

And for the SW relation, we need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z). We know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). Again, we can't derive a clear relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Overall, the constraints given are:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)

But these constraints still allow for NW, W, and SW relations between x and z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, I'm realizing I may have made a thinkingerror when analyzing the W relation.

For x W z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z, which we've shown)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x, which we've shown)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z, which we haven't shown and can't reliably infer from the constraints)

Actually, what I said is correct. NW, W, and SW are all possible.

Actually, let me do one more check:

For x to be W of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x), but we also need supy(x) <= supy(z). Can we determine if supy(x) <= supy(z) or not?

From the constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). Since infy(x) <= supy(x) (for a valid region), we have supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).

However, this gives us a chain that looks like supy(y) <= supy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Next, for x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This gives us a chain that looks like supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x), which doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

Finally, for x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). Since infy(x) <= supy(x) (for a valid region), we have a chain that looks like infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This doesn't tell us if supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, based on the given constraints, NW, W, and SW all remain possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

I think I've been overthinking this problem. Let's consider concrete examples. 

For example, if we place x, y, and z as follows (using rectangles to represent the regions):
```
+-----+
|  x  |
+-----+
        +-----+
        |  y  |
        +-----+
                 +-----+
                 |  z  |
                 +-----+
```
In this case, x is NW of z.

Or, if we place them like this:
```
+-----+
|  x  |          +-----+
+-----+          |     |
        +-----+  |  z  |
        |  y  |  |     |
        +-----+  +-----+
```
Here, x is W of z.

Or like this:
```
                +-----+
                |  z  |
                +-----+
        +-----+
        |  y  |
        +-----+
+-----+
|  x  |
+-----+
```
Here, x is SW of z.

These examples confirm that NW, W, and SW are all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, given the constraints that x is NW of y and y is W of z.

So, to answer the question, the possible relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, wait. let's reconsider the constraints: x is NW of y and y is W of z.

For x NW y:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x) (y is below x)

For y W z:
3. supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z) (the top of y is below or at the same level as the top of z)

From 1 and 3, by transitivity, supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x is to the left of z.

From 2 and 4, we get two constraints: supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). These don't immediately give us a transitive conclusion because the directions of the inequalities don't align.

However, combining them: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
Again, since we're dealing with valid regions, infy(y) <= supy(y) is a natural constraint. So, by transitivity, infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom of z is at or below the bottom of x, which is a constraint for the W relation.

Let's check if we can deduce any other constraints:

For the NW relation, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). From these, we can't directly deduce if supy(z) <= infy(x).

For the W relation, we need supy(x) <= supy(z). We don't have any direct or derived constraints about this.

For the SW relation, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). We know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). These don't immediately give us a transitive conclusion about supy(x) and infy(z). But let me check more carefully.

We have supy(y) <= infy(x). Since x is a valid region, infy(x) <= supy(x). By transitivity, supy(y) <= supy(x).

We also have infy(z) <= infy(y). By the triangle inequality of a valid region (this is not a triangle inequality, but the property that for a non-empty region, the top boundary is strictly above the bottom boundary), infy(y) < supy(y). Combining, infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(x). But I'm not sure how this helps.

Let's try to reason through. We have the chain: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This doesn't tell us if supy(x) <= infy(z). Trying to use transitivity, we just end up with infy(z) <= supy(x), which doesn't rule out the SW relation.

Actually, let's try a slightly different tactic. One way to rule out a relation is to find a counterexample.

Consider the following scenario:
```
+-----+
|  x  |
+-----+
        +-----+  +-----+
        |  y  |  |  z  |
        +-----+  +-----+
```
Here, x is NW of y, and y is W of z. In this scenario, x is NW of z (not SW). This doesn't rule out SW, but it confirms that NW is a possible relation.

Now consider:
```
+-----+
|  x  |          +-----+
+-----+          |     |
        +-----+  |  z  |
        |  y  |  |     |
        +-----+  +-----+
```
Here again, x is NW of y, and y is W of z, but x is W of z. This confirms W as a possible relation.

Let's try for SW:
```
                +-----+
                |  z  |
                +-----+
        +-----+
        |  y  |
        +-----+
+-----+
|  x  |
+-----+
```
In this configuration, x is NW of y, and y is W of z. However, x is not strictly SW of z. In a more precise diagram, the bottom of x would be above the bottom of y (because x is NW of y), and the bottom of y would be above or equal to the bottom of z (because y is W of z). So, the bottom of x would be above the bottom of z, which contradicts the requirement for the SW relation.

So, I think S and SW are not possible. But I'm not fully convinced. Let me try once more to check if SW is possible.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z, which we've shown)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z, which we need to check)

Let's see if the existing constraints allow for supy(x) <= infy(z).

From x NW y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x). This means y is below x. For a valid region, infy(x) <= supy(x), so we have supy(y) <= supy(x).

From y W z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y). Given that y is below x, and z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom, there's no direct constraint that forces supy(x) <= infy(z).

But wait, let's think about this more carefully. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then the top of x is below the bottom of z. But from the constraints, we know that y is below x and z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom. This would mean that the top of x is below the bottom of a region that is below x. This seems contradictory.

Let me trace through:
- x is above y (supy(y) <= infy(x))
- The bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y (infy(z) <= infy(y))
- For a valid region, a region's bottom is below its top (infy(r) <= supy(r))

Combining these, we get: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
There's no constraint preventing supy(x) <= infy(z), which would be required for x to be SW of z.

Wait, I made an error in my analysis. If we combine the constraints, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). For the SW relation, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But this would create a cycle: supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This is a contradiction. So, SW is not a possible relation between x and z. My key error was that I defined infy(z) <= infy(y) to be a cycle, but it isn't- I meant that supy(x) <= infy(z) would cause a cycle.

In conclusion, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW and W.

Actually, since I'm still not super convinced about SW, let me check with a concrete counterexample. In order for x to be SW of z, we need the top of x to be below the bottom of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)). In the given scenario, y is W of z, which means the bottom of y has to be above or at the same level as the bottom of z (infy(z) <= infy(y)). Moreover, y is below x (supy(y) <= infy(x)), which means both the top and bottom of y are below the bottom of x. Since the bottom of z is below the bottom of y (infy(z) <= infy(y)), and the bottom of y is below the bottom of x (infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)), it follows that the bottom of z is below the bottom of x (infy(z) <= infy(x)). This contradicts the requirement for the SW relation, which would need the bottom of z to be above the top of x.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are NW and W.

We have:

1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z, which is required for NW, W, and SW)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x, which is required for W but not for SW)

For the SW relation, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) (unless supy(x) = infy(z) = infy(x), which would be a very specialized case and not typical). Thus, SW is not a general possibility.

For the NW relation, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), and there's no constraint from the given relations that rule this out.

For the W relation, we need supy(x) <= supy(z) besides the constraints we've already shown, and there's no constraint from the given relations that rule this out.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are NW and W.

Alright. I've been overthinking it. I'll check one more concrete counterexample for clarity.

x NW of y means:
- The right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of y.
- The bottom edge of x is above the top edge of y.

y W of z means:
- The right edge of y is to the left of the left edge of z.
- The bottom edge of y is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z.
- The top edge of y is below or at the same level as the top edge of z.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- The right edge of x to be to the left of the left edge of z.
- The top edge of x to be below the bottom edge of z.

Let's think in simple coordinates like (x0, y0) for the bottom-left corner of a region and (x1, y1) for the top-right corner:

x: (x0, y0) to (x1, y1)
y: (y0, y0) to (y1, y1)
z: (z0, z0) to (z1, z1)

For x NW of y:
- x1 < y0
- y1 < x0

For y W of z:
- y1 < z0
- z0 <= y0
- y1 <= z1

For x SW of z, we would need:
- x1 < z0 (which is satisfied by x1 < y0 and y1 < z0)
- x1 < z0 (the top of x is below the bottom of z)

But from the constraints, we have y1 < x0 (the top of y is below the bottom of x) and z0 <= y0 (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y). That means z0 <= y0 < y1 < x0 < x1, which contradicts x1 < z0. I think this shows SW is not possible as a relation between x and z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are NW and W.

ANSWER:

The question asks for possible relations between region x and region z, given:
- x is NW of y
- y is W of z

I'll analyze what these constraints tell us and determine the possible cardinal direction relations.

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is completely below x)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (bottom of z is below or at same level as bottom of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (top of y is below or at same level as top of z)

Combining these constraints:
- From the first constraints of each relation: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can conclude by transitivity that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So x must be completely to the left of z.
- From y W z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and from x NW y, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x). This gives us infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Let's check which cardinal directions are possible:

1. NW: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The first condition is satisfied, and the second is possible.
2. W: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The first two conditions are satisfied, and the third is possible.

SW is not possible because it would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we've established infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means the bottom of z is below the bottom of x, contradicting the SW requirement.

The possible relations are: NW, W
