PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is N of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions:
- x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y N z means: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z.

From x SE y, we know:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
2. supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

From y N z, we know:
3. supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is to the north of z]
4. infx(z) <= infx(y) [z extends at least as far west as y]
5. supx(y) <= supx(z) [z extends at least as far east as y]

Combining these constraints:

From 1 and 5: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
This means that supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z))
But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z on the x-axis.

From 2 and 3: supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
This means that both x and z are below y, but it doesn't directly constrain their relationship to each other.

Let's continue analyzing. We know:
- x is to the east of y (from 1)
- z can extend as far east as it wants, as long as it includes y's eastern boundary (from 5)
- x is to the south of y (from 2)
- z is to the south of y (from 3)

Given these constraints, x could be:

1. NE of z: This would be the case if x is north of z and east of z.
   - Is x north of z? We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), so x and z are both south of y, but we don't know their north-south relationship to each other. x could be north of z.
   - Is x east of z? We know supx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't directly constrain x relative to z on the east-west axis. x could be east of z.

2. E of z: This would be the case if x is directly east of z (neither north nor south).
   - Similar to above, this is possible.

3. SE of z: This would be the case if x is south of z and east of z.
   - Is x south of z? As discussed, this is possible.
   - Is x east of z? As discussed, this is possible.

4. N of z: This would be the case if x is directly north of z (neither east nor west).
   - Is x north of z? As discussed, this is possible.
   - Is x aligned with z on the east-west axis? This would require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which isn't constrained by our given relations. This is possible.

5. S of z: This would be the case if x is directly south of z (neither east nor west).
   - Is x south of z? As discussed, this is possible.
   - Is x aligned with z on the east-west axis? As discussed, this is possible.

6. NW of z: This would be the case if x is north of z and west of z.
   - Is x north of z? As discussed, this is possible.
   - Is x west of z? This would require supx(x) <= infx(z). We know supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y). From these, we get: supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). These don't directly constrain supx(x) relative to infx(z). However, given that x is east of y and z includes y's eastern boundary, it seems unlikely that x would be west of z. Let's investigate this further.

Actually, let's be more structured in our analysis. Let's consider the spatial arrangement on each axis separately.

On the x-axis:
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
- From y N z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) [z extends at least as far in both directions as y on the x-axis]

From this, we can derive: supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
Which implies: infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)
This means that infx(z) <= infx(x), but we don't know the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).

If supx(z) <= infx(x), then z is entirely to the west of x, meaning x could be E, NE, or SE of z.
If infx(x) < supx(z), then z and x overlap on the x-axis, meaning x could be N, S, or any other relation that involves overlap on the x-axis.

On the y-axis:
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]
- From y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is to the north of z]

From this, we can derive: supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z on the y-axis. Both x and z are below y, but x could be above, below, or at the same level as z.

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then z is entirely to the south of x, meaning x could be N, NE, or NW of z.
If infy(x) < supy(z), then z and x overlap on the y-axis, meaning x could be E, W, or any other relation that involves overlap on the y-axis.

Given these constraints, x could potentially be in any of the 9 basic (single-tile) relations with z, depending on the specific positions of the regions. However, some relations might be more constrained than others given the initial conditions.

Let's double check. The initial conditions are that x is SE of y and y is N of z.

SE relation says that:
- Region x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- Region x is to the south of y: supy(x) <= infy(y)

N relation says that:
- Region y is to the north of z: supy(z) <= infy(y)
- Region y is at least partially aligned with z on the x-axis: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

I think there's a clearer approach to this. Let's consider the bounding boxes of the three regions and reason based on their relative positions.

Given that x is SE of y:
- The bounding box of x is to the east and south of the bounding box of y.

Given that y is N of z:
- The bounding box of y is to the north of the bounding box of z, and they are at least partially aligned on the x-axis.

Now, consider where x could be relative to z:

1. On the x-axis, we know x is to the east of y, and y is at least partially aligned with z. This means x could be to the east of z, or they could be partially aligned.

2. On the y-axis, we know x is to the south of y, and y is to the north of z. This means x could be to the north of z, to the south of z, or they could be partially aligned.

Let's examine each of the 9 basic relations to determine if they're possible:

1. x N z: This would mean x is directly to the north of z. This is possible if x is south of y but still north of z.

2. x NE z: This would mean x is to the north and east of z. This is possible if x is south of y but still north of z, and x is east of z.

3. x E z: This would mean x is directly to the east of z. This is possible if x is south of y and at the same level as z.

4. x SE z: This would mean x is to the south and east of z. This is possible if x is south of y and also south of z.

5. x S z: This would mean x is directly to the south of z. This is possible if x is south of y and also south of z, and x is at least partially aligned with z on the x-axis.

6. x SW z: This would mean x is to the south and west of z. But we know x is to the east of y, and y is at least partially aligned with z on the x-axis. This means x can't be to the west of z. So SW is not possible.

7. x W z: This would mean x is directly to the west of z. But, as above, this is not possible because x is to the east of y.

8. x NW z: This would mean x is to the north and west of z. But, as above, this is not possible because x is to the east of y.

9. x B z: This would mean x is inside the bounding box of z. Given that x is to the east of y, and y is at least partially aligned with z on the x-axis, x can't be inside the bounding box of z. So B is not possible.

Oh, wait, I need to be more careful about the interpretation here. Let's review the definition of cardinal direction relations:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

This means the relation "a N b" doesn't just mean "a is north of b," but rather "a is in the northern tile of b," where the tiles are defined by the bounding box of b.

Alright, let's approach this again, keeping in mind the exact definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

Given that x SE y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is in the southern tile of y]
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is in the eastern tile of y]

Given that y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is in the northern tile of z]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) [y is partially aligned with z on the x-axis]

Now, let's determine where x is relative to z:

1. On the y-axis, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). This gives us no direct comparison between supy(x) and supy(z). However, since both x and z are south of y, they could be in any relation to each other on the y-axis. Specifically, supy(x) could be less than, equal to, or greater than infy(z). This means x could be in the southern, middle, or northern tile of z on the y-axis.

2. On the x-axis, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). From supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can't directly infer anything about infx(x) relative to infx(z) or supx(z). However, since x is east of y and y is partially aligned with z, x could be east of z, or they could be partially aligned. Specifically, infx(x) could be less than, equal to, or greater than supx(z). This means x could be in the middle or eastern tile of z on the x-axis, but not in the western tile (because x is east of y, which doesn't extend west of z).

Combining these, and given the definitions of the cardinal direction relations, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. x N z: This is possible if x is in the northern tile of z, and also in the middle tile of z on the x-axis.
2. x NE z: This is possible if x is in the northern tile of z, and also in the eastern tile of z.
3. x E z: This is possible if x is in the middle tile of z on the y-axis, and in the eastern tile of z on the x-axis.
4. x SE z: This is possible if x is in the southern tile of z, and in the eastern tile of z.
5. x S z: This is possible if x is in the southern tile of z, and in the middle tile of z on the x-axis.
6. x SW z: This is not possible because x can't be in the western tile of z (as discussed).
7. x W z: This is not possible for the same reason.
8. x NW z: This is not possible for the same reason.
9. x B z: This is not possible because x can't be inside the bounding box of z (because x is east of y, and the bounding box of y is not entirely inside the bounding box of z).

But wait, I need to double check my reasoning for B. For x B z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

We've established:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is east of y]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [z extends at least as far west as y]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [z extends at least as far east as y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is south of y]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [z is south of y]

For B to be possible, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x): This could be true if infx(z) = infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x). But we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which means y and x don't overlap on the x-axis. Since infx(y) < supx(y), we have infx(y) < infx(x). If infx(z) <= infx(y), then infx(z) < infx(x).
- supx(x) <= supx(z): This could be true without contradicting our established facts.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): This could be true without contradicting our established facts.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): This could be true without contradicting our established facts.

Actually, let's just reread the definition of B to make sure I've got it right:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Actually, my reasoning doesn't seem correct. Let's rethink this.

For x B z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've established:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is east of y]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [z extends at least as far west as y]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [z extends at least as far east as y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is south of y]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [z is south of y]

From these, can we derive the conditions for x B z?

We know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) < infx(x), which contradicts the first condition for x B z. Therefore, x B z is not possible.

Alright, let's recap the possible relations between x and z:

1. x N z: Possible.
2. x NE z: Possible.
3. x E z: Possible.
4. x SE z: Possible.
5. x S z: Possible.
6. x SW z: Not possible.
7. x W z: Not possible.
8. x NW z: Not possible.
9. x B z: Not possible.

Umm, I'm confused. I previously said B is not possible, but I'm not sure. Let me reconsider B.

For x B z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've established:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is east of y]
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [z extends at least as far west as y]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [z extends at least as far east as y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is south of y]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [z is south of y]

From supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can infer that infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). However, this implies infx(z) < infx(x), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for x B z. Actually, I realize that infx(z) < infx(x) does imply infx(z) <= infx(x), so this condition is actually satisfied.

Let's double check. From supx(y) <= infx(x), we know y is to the west of x, so infx(y) < infx(x). And from infx(z) <= infx(y), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < infx(x). So infx(z) < infx(x), which implies infx(z) <= infx(x). So the first condition for x B z is satisfied.

For the second condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), we have no constraints that directly relate supx(x) to supx(z). So this condition could be met.

For the third condition, infy(z) <= infy(x), we have no constraints that directly relate infy(z) to infy(x). So this condition could be met.

For the fourth condition, supy(x) <= supy(z), we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), so both x and z are below y, but we can't infer anything about the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) directly. So this condition could be met.

Actually, I think I inferred incorrectly earlier. Let's recheck. 

For infx(z) <= infx(x), we've established that infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). But these don't directly imply infx(z) <= infx(x). The best we can say is infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). Without knowing the relationship between infx(y) and supx(y), we can't definitely conclude infx(z) <= infx(x).

But from the definition of regions, infx(y) < supx(y) must hold, so we can say infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us infx(z) < infx(x) and hence infx(z) <= infx(x). So the first condition is satisfied.

For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints. If x is much to the east of y and z, then this might not hold. But if x is just slightly to the east of y and z extends far to the east, then this might hold. So this condition could be satisfied, but is not guaranteed.

For infy(z) <= infy(x), we have no direct constraints. Given the relations we know, x could be above, at the same level, or below z. So this condition could be satisfied, but is not guaranteed.

For supy(x) <= supy(z), again, we have no direct constraints from the relations we know. So this condition could be satisfied, but is not guaranteed.

Therefore, x B z is possible, but not guaranteed.

I think I inferred incorrectly. Let's carefully revisit everything. We know:

1. x SE y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

2. y N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is to the north of z]
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) [y is aligned with z on the x-axis]

For x B z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) 
  From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
  From y N z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y).
  We don't know the relationship between infx(y) and supx(y), so we can't directly compare infx(z) and infx(x).
  Wait, actually since these are regions, infx(y) < supx(y) by definition. So we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us infx(z) < infx(x) and hence infx(z) <= infx(x). So this condition is satisfied.

- supx(x) <= supx(z)
  We don't have direct constraints for this from the relations we know. So this condition might or might not be satisfied.

- infy(z) <= infy(x)
  We don't have direct constraints for this from the relations we know. So this condition might or might not be satisfied.

- supy(x) <= supy(z)
  From x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y).
  From y N z, we know supy(z) <= infy(y).
  So both supy(x) and supy(z) are less than or equal to infy(y), but we can't directly compare them. So this condition might or might not be satisfied.

Therefore, x B z is definitely not ruled out by the constraints. It depends on the specific positions of the regions.

Actually, I think I can show more clearly that x B z is impossible. Given that x SE y and y N z, let's use the constraints:

1. x SE y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y)

2. y N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x B z, we would need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From the constraint supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y), we know that x and y don't overlap on the x-axis. Specifically, the easternmost point of y is to the west of the westernmost point of x.

From the constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is aligned with z on the x-axis), we know that z covers the entire range of y on the x-axis, and might extend beyond.

Now, for x B z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x). Given infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), to say that infx(z) <= infx(x), we would need to know the relationship between infx(y) and supx(y).

Since y is a region, infx(y) < supx(y) must hold. So we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us infx(z) < infx(x).

Actually I'm wrong here. We have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) < infx(x). This means the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) is actually satisfied, not violated!

I'm going to try a different approach. Let's visualize the possible arrangements.

First, we know x is SE of y and y is N of z.

Given the definition of SE, x is to the southeast of y, meaning x doesn't overlap with y in either the x or y direction. And given the definition of N, y is to the north of z and is at least partially aligned with z on the x-axis.

Now, if x were B(inside) z, then x would have to be completely contained within the bounding box of z. This means the bounding box of z would extend to include x. Given that x is to the east and south of y, and y is to the north of z, z would have to extend east of y to include x, and it would also have to extend south of y to include x.

If z extends east of y and south of y, then the bounding box of z would completely contain the bounding box of y. But this contradicts the definition of the N relation, which requires that y is to the north of z.

I think I'm making an error in my reasoning. Let's double check understanding the definitions:

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For a B b, we have:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

Alright, let's use these exact definitions for our problem.

We know:
1. x SE y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y)

2. y N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x B z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's check each of these conditions:

1. infx(z) <= infx(x):
   From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
   From y N z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y).
   We can't directly compare infx(z) and infx(x) from these. The best we can say is infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
   However, since y is a region, infx(y) <= supx(y) must hold. So we can say infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us infx(z) <= infx(x). So the first condition is satisfied.

2. supx(x) <= supx(z):
   From x SE y, there's no constraint relating supx(x) to anything else.
   From y N z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z).
   Without additional constraints, we can't determine if supx(x) <= supx(z) holds. So this condition might or might not be satisfied.

3. infy(z) <= infy(x):
   From x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y).
   From y N z, we know supy(z) <= infy(y).
   Without additional constraints, we can't determine if infy(z) <= infy(x) holds. So this condition might or might not be satisfied.

4. supy(x) <= supy(z):
   From x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y).
   From y N z, we know supy(z) <= infy(y).
   Without additional constraints, we can't directly compare supy(x) and supy(z). So this condition might or might not be satisfied.

So, the first condition is definitely satisfied, and the other three conditions might or might not be satisfied. This suggests that x B z is possible, but not guaranteed. It would depend on the specific positions of the regions.

Actually, I think it can't be x B z. For x B z, we'd need supx(x) <= supx(z), meaning the easternmost point of x is not east of the easternmost point of z. However, given that x is to the east of y and y is (at least partially) aligned with z on the x-axis, it's plausible for x to extend east of z, which would violate the condition supx(x) <= supx(z).

But does supx(y) <= supx(z) imply that z extends further east than y? Or could they exactly align at the eastern edge? Hmm, right, the definition says supx(y) <= supx(z), so z extends at least as far east as y. I see. So maybe we can't rule out x B z based on just the eastern extent. But what about the other conditions?

Hmm, actually, I think B might be possible after all. Let's go through a concrete example:

Suppose y is a unit square with its southwest corner at the origin, so y spans from (0, 0) to (1, 1). Now, let's place z to be a larger square that completely contains y, except for a small portion at the top. For instance, z spans from (-1, -1) to (2, 0.9). This satisfies y N z because y is entirely to the north of z, except for that small overlap, and y is entirely within the x-range of z.

Now, we want to place x to the southeast of y. Let's say x is a unit square with its southwest corner at (1, -1), so x spans from (1, -1) to (2, 0). This satisfies x SE y because x is entirely to the southeast of y. Let me think on this.

Now, let's check if x is B z. We have:
- infx(z) = -1, which is <= infx(x) = 1, so this condition is satisfied.
- supx(x) = 2, which is <= supx(z) = 2, so this condition is satisfied.
- infy(z) = -1, which is <= infy(x) = -1, so this condition is satisfied.
- supy(x) = 0, which is <= supy(z) = 0.9, so this condition is satisfied.

all conditions for x B z are satisfied in this scenario. Therefore, x B z is a possible relation given the constraints that x SE y and y N z.

OK so let's recap the possible relations between x and z. For each one, I'll provide a concrete example as a counterexample, or I'll show why it's impossible based on the constraints.

1. x B z: As shown above, this is possible.

2. x N z: This would mean supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), we have from the given constraints: supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y). Without additional information, we can't determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) holds. This could be true.
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), we've already shown above that this is true based on the constraints.
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), as discussed for the B relation, this could be true depending on the exact positions.
   So, x N z is possible.

3. x S z: This would mean supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we've not shown any constraint that ensures this. So, this could be true or false.
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), we've already shown above that this is true based on the constraints.
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), as discussed for the B relation, this could be true depending on the exact positions.
   So, x S z is possible.

4. x E z: This would mean supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), we know from y N z that supx(y) <= supx(z), and from x SE y that supx(y) <= infx(x). If supx(y) = supx(z), then supx(z) <= infx(x) is true. But if supx(y) < supx(z), then we'd need more information to determine if supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), as discussed for the B relation, these could be true depending on the exact positions.
   So, I believe x E z is possible, but it would depend on the exact positioning of the regions.

5. x W z: This would mean supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), we know from x SE y that supx(y) <= infx(x) and from y N z that infx(z) <= infx(y). If we combine these, we get: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z).
   So, x W z is impossible.

6. x NE z: This would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), as discussed for the N relation, this could be true.
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), similar to the argument for E, this could be true if supx(y) = supx(z), given that supx(y) <= infx(x). If supx(y) < supx(z), then we'd need more information.
   So, x NE z is possible, but it depends on the exact positioning.

7. x SE z: This would mean supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), as discussed for the S relation, this could be true.
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), as discussed for the NE relation, this could be true.
   So, x SE z is possible, but it depends on the exact positioning.

8. x NW z: This would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), as discussed for the N relation, this could be true.
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), as discussed for the W relation, this is impossible based on the constraints.
   So, x NW z is impossible.

9. x SW z: This would mean supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), as discussed for the S relation, this could be true.
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), as discussed for the W relation, this is impossible based on the constraints.
   So, x SW z is impossible.

OK, let's review our answers again:

1. x B z: Possible.
2. x N z: Possible.
3. x S z: Possible.
4. x E z: Possible, but it depends on the exact positioning.
5. x W z: Impossible.
6. x NE z: Possible, but it depends on the exact positioning.
7. x SE z: Possible, but it depends on the exact positioning.
8. x NW z: Impossible.
9. x SW z: Impossible.

To be honest, I'm still unsure about x E z. Let me think through it again.

For x E z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y N z, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

We're trying to determine if supx(z) <= infx(x) can hold. We know supx(y) <= infx(x) from x SE y, and supx(y) <= supx(z) from y N z.

If supx(y) = supx(z), then supx(z) = supx(y) <= infx(x), so the condition is satisfied.

But if supx(y) < supx(z), then supx(z) > supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), but we can't directly determine if supx(z) <= infx(x). However, it's possible for supx(z) to be greater than infx(x), which would violate the condition for x E z.

Actually, let me be more rigorous. From supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we can't directly infer supx(z) <= infx(x). In fact, supx(z) could be greater than infx(x), which would contradict the condition for x E z. So, x E z is not guaranteed based on the constraints.

But could it be possible in some specific arrangements? Let's try to construct an example:

Let y be a unit square with its southwest corner at the origin, so y spans from (0, 0) to (1, 1). Now, let's place z to be a rectangle that extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 0.9). This satisfies y N z because y is entirely to the north of z, except for that small overlap, and y is partially within the x-range of z.

Now, we want to place x to the southeast of y. Let's say x is a unit square with its southwest corner at (1.5, -0.5), so x spans from (1.5, -0.5) to (2.5, 0.5). This satisfies x SE y because x is entirely to the southeast of y.

Now, let's check if x is E z. We have:
- supx(z) = 1, which is <= infx(x) = 1.5, so this condition is satisfied.
- infy(z) = -1, which is <= infy(x) = -0.5, so this condition is satisfied.
- supy(x) = 0.5, which is <= supy(z) = 0.9, so this condition is satisfied.

All conditions for x E z are satisfied in this scenario. Therefore, x E z is a possible relation given the constraints that x SE y and y N z.

So, x E z is indeed possible, but it's not guaranteed based on the constraints.

Now, let's revisit the answers:

1. x B z: Possible.
2. x N z: Possible.
3. x S z: Possible.
4. x E z: Possible, but it depends on the exact positioning.
5. x W z: Impossible.
6. x NE z: Possible, but it depends on the exact positioning.
7. x SE z: Possible, but it depends on the exact positioning.
8. x NW z: Impossible.
9. x SW z: Impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, S, E, NE, SE.

Just to be totally sure, let's check if I'm correct for the other relations.

For x SW z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y N z, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For the first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), from x SE y, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x), which means y doesn't overlap with x on the x-axis. And from y N z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), which means z extends at least as far west as y. If we combine these, we can't directly infer anything about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

Actually, let me approach it differently:
- From y N z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), which means the westernmost point of z is not east of the westernmost point of y.
- From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which means the easternmost point of y is not east of the westernmost point of x.

This means, infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). Thus, infx(z) < supx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x SW z. Actually, I'm wrong in the inequality. From supx(y) <= infx(x), we can't say infx(y) < supx(y); these are for different regions.

Let me try again:
- From y N z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), which means the westernmost point of z is not east of the westernmost point of y.
- From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which means the easternmost point of y is not east of the westernmost point of x.

If we combine these, we can say:
infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x)
Where the middle inequality, infx(y) < supx(y), comes from the fact that y is a region and must have non-zero width.

So, infx(z) < supx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x SW z.

Hence, x SW z is impossible.

For x NW z, the reasoning is similar. It's impossible.

For x W z, one of the conditions is supx(x) <= infx(z), which we've just shown is impossible. Hence, x W z is also impossible.

For x N z, we would need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've already shown that infx(z) <= infx(x) holds from the constraints. For supy(z) <= infy(x), we know supy(z) <= infy(y) from y N z, and supy(x) <= infy(y) from x SE y. This means both z and x are below y. However, it doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x). So, this condition might or might not be satisfied, depending on the exact positions.

For the last part, supx(x) <= supx(z), as discussed for the B relation, this could be true or false depending on the exact positions.

So, x N z is possible, but it's not guaranteed based on just the constraints.

Actually, let me construct a quick concrete example to see if this works.
Let y be a unit square with its southwest corner at the origin, so y spans from (0, 0) to (1, 1). Now, let's place z to be a rectangle that extends from (-1, -1) to (2, 0). This satisfies y N z because y is entirely to the north of z, except for that small overlap, and y is partially within the x-range of z.

Now, we want to place x to the southeast of y. Let's say x is a unit square with its southwest corner at (1, 0.1), so x spans from (1, 0.1) to (2, 1.1). This satisfies x SE y because x is entirely to the southeast of y.

Now, let's check if x is N z. We have:
- supy(z) = 0, which is <= infy(x) = 0.1, so this condition is satisfied.
- infx(z) = -1, which is <= infx(x) = 1, so this condition is satisfied.
- supx(x) = 2, which is <= supx(z) = 2, so this condition is satisfied.

All conditions for x N z are satisfied in this scenario. Therefore, x N z is a possible relation given the constraints that x SE y and y N z.

Similar reasoning and examples can be constructed for x S z, x NE z, and x SE z.

Let's quickly verify if these are possibilities.

For x NE z, we would need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

Again, let's construct a concrete example:
Let y be a unit square with its southwest corner at the origin, so y spans from (0, 0) to (1, 1). Now, let's place z to be a rectangle that extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 0). This satisfies y N z because y is entirely to the north of z, and y is partially within the x-range of z.

Now, we want to place x to the southeast of y. Let's say x is a unit square with its southwest corner at (1.5, 0.1), so x spans from (1.5, 0.1) to (2.5, 1.1). This satisfies x SE y because x is entirely to the southeast of y.

Now, let's check if x is NE z. We have:
- supy(z) = 0, which is <= infy(x) = 0.1, so this condition is satisfied.
- supx(z) = 1, which is <= infx(x) = 1.5, so this condition is satisfied.

All conditions for x NE z are satisfied in this scenario. Therefore, x NE z is a possible relation given the constraints that x SE y and y N z.

For x SE z, the reasoning is similar. We can construct an example where x is entirely to the southeast of z, satisfying the constraints that x SE y and y N z. These make sense given the constraints.

For x S z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Let's construct a concrete example:
Let y be a unit square with its southwest corner at the origin, so y spans from (0, 0) to (1, 1). Now, let's place z to be a rectangle that extends from (-1, 0.5) to (2, 1.5). This satisfies y N z because y is to the north of z for a portion of y, and y is partially within the x-range of z.

Now, we want to place x to the southeast of y. Let's say x is a unit square with its southwest corner at (1, -1), so x spans from (1, -1) to (2, 0). This satisfies x SE y because x is entirely to the southeast of y.

Now, let's check if x is S z. We have:
- supy(x) = 0, which is <= infy(z) = 0.5, so this condition is satisfied.
- infx(z) = -1, which is <= infx(x) = 1, so this condition is satisfied.
- supx(x) = 2, which is <= supx(z) = 2, so this condition is satisfied.

All conditions for x S z are satisfied in this scenario. Therefore, x S z is a possible relation given the constraints that x SE y and y N z.

Let me double check one more time that the only ones that are possible are: B, N, S, E, NE, SE.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For x NE z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

For x SE z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

For x NW z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

For x SW z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

From our constraints, we've established:
- From x SE y, we know:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x)
  - supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y N z, we know:
  - supy(z) <= infy(y)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these constraints, we've shown that x W z, x NW z, and x SW z are impossible because they all require supx(x) <= infx(z), which is contradicted by our constraints. We can't establish direct constraints that ensure conditions for the other relations are satisfied, meaning they are possible, but depend on the exact positions.
But we can use concrete examples to show that x B z, x N z, x S z, x E z, x NE z, and x SE z are possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, S, E, NE, SE.

Actually, I think I was wrong about B. Let me double check. For x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the given constraints, we've shown that infx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied. For the other three, we don't have constraints that directly infer a yes or no. So, all four conditions for x B z could potentially be satisfied.

I tried to provide a concrete example for x B z. Let me double check:
Suppose y is a unit square from (0, 0) to (1, 1), z spans from (-1, -1) to (2, 0.9), and x spans from (1, -1) to (2, 0).

- infx(z) = -1, which is <= infx(x) = 1, so this condition is satisfied.
- supx(x) = 2, which is <= supx(z) = 2, so this condition is satisfied.
- infy(z) = -1, which is <= infy(x) = -1, so this condition is satisfied.
- supy(x) = 0, which is <= supy(z) = 0.9, so this condition is satisfied.

All conditions for x B z are satisfied, so x B z is possible.

So, to finalize, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, S, E, NE, SE.

Actually, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, the central tile. From the definitions:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So a B b implies that a is completely contained within the bounding box of b.

Given that x SE y and y N z, as we've seen from our examples, it's possible for x to be contained within the bounding box of z. So x B z is a possibility.

Actually, let me ask again from the definitions what we know in terms of relative positions.

From x SE y:
- x is entirely southeast of y, so their bounding boxes don't overlap.

From y N z:
- y is to the north of z and is at least partially aligned with z on the x-axis.

From these, can z's bounding box entirely contain x?

Given that y and x don't overlap, and y is north of z, it seems implausible for z to completely contain x. But let's see if we can construct an example.

Ok, here's a counter-example where B is poissible: Suppose y is a unit square with its southwest corner at the origin, spanning from (0, 0) to (1, 1). Now, let's place z to be a larger square that extends from (-1, -1) to (2, 0.9). This satisfies y N z because y is entirely to the north of z, except for that small overlap, and y is entirely within the x-range of z. Now, we want to place x to the southeast of y. Let's say x is a unit square with its southwest corner at (1, -1), so x spans from (1, -1) to (2, 0). This satisfies x SE y because x is entirely to the southeast of y. For x B z, we have:
- infx(z) = -1, which is <= infx(x) = 1, so this condition is satisfied.
- supx(x) = 2, which is <= supx(z) = 2, so this condition is satisfied.
- infy(z) = -1, which is <= infy(x) = -1, so this condition is satisfied.
- supy(x) = 0, which is <= supy(z) = 0.9, so this condition is satisfied.

So, all conditions for x B z are satisfied in our counter-example.

Wait, let me double check first. B requires:
infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So for x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

In my counter-example, I have:
- infx(z) = -1, which is <= infx(x) = 1. So, infx(z) <= infx(x). Check.
- supx(x) = 2, which is <= supx(z) = 2. So, supx(x) <= supx(z). Check.
- infy(z) = -1, which is <= infy(x) = -1. So, infy(z) <= infy(x). Check.
- supy(x) = 0, which is <= supy(z) = 0.9. So, supy(x) <= supy(z). Check.

All of the conditions for x B z are indeed satisfied, so x B z is a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between regions x and z are:
- B
- N
- NE
- E
- SE
- S

And the impossible relationships are:
- NW
- W
- SW

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is N of z

First, let me analyze what these relations tell us:
- x SE y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can determine:
- x is east of y (since supx(y) ≤ infx(x))
- x is south of y (since supy(x) ≤ infy(y))
- y is north of z (since supy(z) ≤ infy(y))
- z extends at least as far west and east as y does

The possible relations between x and z are:

N, NE, E, SE, S, B

The impossible relations are NW, W, and SW, because these would require x to be west of z, which contradicts our constraints (since x is east of y, and z extends at least as far east as y).
