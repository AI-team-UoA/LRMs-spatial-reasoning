PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step by step.

We know:
- x is E of y
- y is S of z

We need to determine the possible relation(s) between x and z.

Let's use the definitions provided:

x E y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

y S z means:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's determine what these constraints tell us about the possible positions of x relative to z.

From x E y:
1. x is to the right of y (supx(y) <= infx(x))
2. x's y-coordinates overlap with y's y-coordinates (infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y))

From y S z:
3. y is below z (supy(y) <= infy(z))
4. y's x-coordinates are within z's x-coordinates (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

Now, let's combine these constraints:

From 1 and 4, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-coordinates are within z's x-coordinates)
This implies: infx(x) can be either <= supx(z) or > supx(z). In other words, x can either overlap with z's x-coordinates or be completely to the right of z.

From 2 and 3, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-coordinates overlap with y's y-coordinates)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
This implies: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means x is below z.

So, x is either to the right of z and below it, or x's x-coordinates overlap with z's and x is below z. 

Let's check which cardinal relations these correspond to:

If x is to the right of z and below it, then x is SE of z.
If x's x-coordinates overlap with z's and x is below z, then x is S of z.

Let's verify more carefully:

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

From our constraints, we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). And if infx(x) > supx(z), then x is to the right of z, making x SE of z.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within z's x-coordinates)

From our constraints, we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). If infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x can be S of z. However, the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) isn't guaranteed by our given constraints.

Let's reconsider:

From x E y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-coordinates overlap with y's y-coordinates)

From y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-coordinates are within z's x-coordinates)

The relation between x and z depends on the exact positions of these regions. The constraints don't uniquely determine the relation. Let's consider possible relative positions and the corresponding relations:

1. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the right of z. Combined with the fact that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), x is SE of z.

2. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x's x-coordinates are within z's x-coordinates. Combined with the fact that x is below z, x is S of z.

3. If infx(x) <= infx(z) and infx(z) <= supx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x's x-coordinates partially overlap with z's x-coordinates (with x extending to the left of z). Combined with the fact that x is below z, x is SW:S of z. However, our definition of cardinal relations requires regions to be in a single tile, so this isn't a valid single-tile relation.

4. If infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x), then x's x-coordinates contain z's x-coordinates. Combined with the fact that x is below z, this would be a multi-tile relation, which again isn't a single-tile relation.

Given the constraints, it seems that x can be either SE of z or S of z, depending on the exact positions.

Hmm, as I've been reasoning, I've been making a mistake in the constraints. I should clarify the East and South relations.

x E y is defined as:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-range is contained within y's y-range)

y S z is defined as:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-range is contained within z's x-range)

Now, let's again consider what these constraints tell us about the possible positions of x relative to z.

From y S z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left edge of y is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right edge of y is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z)

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or aligned with the bottom edge of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top edge of x is below or aligned with the top edge of y)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z).
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which doesn't necessarily tell us how x and z relate in the x-dimension, except that there's some possibility of overlap.

Given these constraints, x could be in any of the following positions relative to z:
- SE of z (if x is to the right of z).
- S of z (if x's x-range is contained within z's x-range).
- SW of z (if x is to the left of z).
- A combination of these (multi-tile relation).

Actually, let's check if x SW z is possible. For this, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

From our constraints:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left edge of y is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x)

This doesn't clearly establish that supx(x) <= infx(z), so x SW z is possible but not guaranteed.

Let's try a visual approach. Here's a schematic of the constraints:

For y S z:
```
+---------------------+
|         z           |
+---------------------+
        |    |
        v    v
    +----------+
    |    y     |
    +----------+
```

For x E y:
```
    +----------+     +----------+
    |    y     |     |    x     |
    +----------+     +----------+
                 ---->
```

Combining them:
```
+---------------------+
|         z           |
+---------------------+
        |    |
        v    v
    +----------+     +----------+
    |    y     |     |    x     |
    +----------+     +----------+
                 ---->
```

Looking at this, x is below z (since y is below z and x has the same y-range as y). In terms of the x-dimension, x is to the right of y, but y's x-range is contained within z's x-range. This means x can be to the right of z, within z's x-range, or even to the left of z (if y is sufficiently to the left within z's x-range and x is slightly to the right of y).

So, given the constraints, x could be in any of the following positions relative to z:
- SE of z.
- S of z.
- SW of z.
- A combination of these (multi-tile relation).

Hmm, I think I'm still making an error in reasoning. Let me think this through once more, carefully.

We have:
- x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's determine the constraints on x and z.

From the second and third constraints of x E y and y S z, we have:
infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
which implies supy(x) <= infy(z).

This tells us that x is below z.

From the first constraints of x E y and y S z, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
which tells us infx(z) <= infx(y) < infx(x).

This suggests that the left edge of x is to the right of the left edge of z. But it doesn't tell us the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z), nor does it give us a strict relationship between infx(x) and supx(z).

Given supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we can't determine if infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(x) > supx(z). Both cases are possible.

So, x can be either:
- entirely to the right of z (if infx(x) > supx(z)), which means x is SE of z.
- partially overlapping with z in the x-dimension (if infx(x) <= supx(z)), which means x could be S, SE, or both (a multi-tile relation).

I'm going to check again the definition of the S and SE directions to make sure.

SE: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
S: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z)

From our constraints, we've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z). But we don't have a definitive constraint on supx(x) relative to supx(z).

If supx(x) <= supx(z), then x S z is a possibility.
If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x SE z is a possibility.

OK wait let me revisit the x E y constraint:

x E y is defined as:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-range is contained within y's y-range)

The key thing here is that since supx(y) <= infx(x), the entirety of region x is to the right of region y.

And for the y S z constraint:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-range is contained within z's x-range)

Given that y's x-range is contained within z's x-range and x is entirely to the right of y, x can be in different positions relative to z:
- x can be entirely to the right of z.
- x can overlap with z's x-range but extend beyond it.
- x can be entirely within z's x-range.

But since we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z), we are left with the following possible relations between x and z:
- x SE z (if x is entirely to the right of z).
- x S z (if x's x-range is entirely within z's x-range).
- x's x-range partially overlaps with z's x-range, which would result in a multi-tile relation, a combination of S and SE.

But let me check more. I'll use the contraints about the infimums and supremums to see exactly which relations are possible.

We have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x is below z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) (by definition of a region), we have infx(z) <= supx(y).
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y), so combining with the above, we get infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This means the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of z.

Now, let's consider the possible relations:

1. For x SE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z). But for supx(z) <= infx(x), we have:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

   This doesn't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x). It's possible that supx(y) < supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(z).

2. For x S z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z)

   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x). But for supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have a direct constraint. It's possible that supx(x) > supx(z).

3. For x SW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z). But for supx(x) <= infx(z), we have:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y), which means x is to the right of y.
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z), which means y is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z.

   Given these, it's impossible for x to be to the left of z, as that would contradict the above constraints.

4. For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or aligned with the bottom edge of z)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or aligned with the top edge of z)

   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. This contradicts the constraints for x E z. So, x cannot be E of z.

5. For x W z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or aligned with the bottom edge of z)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or aligned with the top edge of z)

   As already discussed for SW, it's impossible for x to be to the left of z. So, x cannot be W of z.

6. For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z)

   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z. This contradicts the constraint for x N z. So, x cannot be N of z.

7. For x NE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z. This contradicts the constraint for x NE z. So, x cannot be NE of z.

8. For x NW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

   As already discussed, it's impossible for x to be to the left of z. Additionally, we've established that x is below z. So, x cannot be NW of z.

9. For x B z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or aligned with the bottom edge of z)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or aligned with the top edge of z)

   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. This contradicts the constraint for x B z. So, x cannot be B of z.

So, after going through all the cardinal relations, the possible relations between x and z are S and SE. Additionally, if x's x-range partially overlaps with z's x-range (extending beyond it to the right), we'd have a multi-tile relation, a combination of S and SE. But we were asked for single-tile relations, so I'll just say S and SE.

But wait, I want to triple-check if S is indeed possible. 

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z)

We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x). For supx(x) <= supx(z), let's think about it.

From x E y, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x), which means the right edge of y is to the left of the left edge of x. This tells us that x is entirely to the right of y.

From y S z, we know that supx(y) <= supx(z), which means the right edge of y is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z.

But these constraints don't tell us anything definitive about the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). It's possible for supx(x) to be less than, equal to, or greater than supx(z). So, x S z is indeed a possibility.

Let's also triple-check if SE is possible.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z). For supx(z) <= infx(x), we have:
- From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
- From y S z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z).

This doesn't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(y) < supx(z), then we'd have supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(z), which means x is not to the right of z.

Actually, this reveals that the SE relation is not guaranteed. It's possible that x is entirely to the right of z, but it's also possible that it's not.

Given all of this, it seems like the only definite relation that's possible is x S z. But I believe both S and SE are possible, depending on the exact positions.

OK, I think I'm getting confused. Let's try a slightly different approach, by considering some concrete examples.

First, let's consider regions that satisfy the constraints:
- x E y
- y S z

One example setup:
- z spans from (0, 5) to (10, 10).
- y spans from (2, 0) to (8, 3).
- x spans from (9, 1) to (12, 2).

In this example, y is below z (y S z), and x is to the right of y (x E y). And in this example, x is SE of z because it's below and to the right of z.

Let's try another example:
- z spans from (0, 5) to (10, 10).
- y spans from (2, 0) to (8, 3).
- x spans from (9, 1) to (10, 2).

In this example, y is below z (y S z), and x is to the right of y (x E y). And in this example, x is S of z because it's below z and its x-range is contained within z's x-range. This contradicts what I previously said!

Actually wait no. Let's be careful. I said y spans from (2, 0) to (8, 3). That means:
- infy(y) = 0
- infx(y) = 2
- supy(y) = 3
- supx(y) = 8

Similarly for z and x.

For z:
- infy(z) = 5
- infx(z) = 0
- supy(z) = 10
- supx(z) = 10

For x:
- infy(x) = 1
- infx(x) = 9
- supy(x) = 2
- supx(x) = 10

Let's check the constraints:
- For x E y, we need:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x): 8 <= 9 (true)
  - infy(y) <= infy(x): 0 <= 1 (true)
  - supy(x) <= supy(y): 2 <= 3 (true)
  OK, x E y is satisfied.

- For y S z, we need:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z): 3 <= 5 (true)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y): 0 <= 2 (true)
  - supx(y) <= supx(z): 8 <= 10 (true)
  OK, y S z is satisfied.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- For x SE z, we need:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x): 10 <= 9 (false)
  - supy(x) <= infy(z): 2 <= 5 (true)
  The first condition is not met, so x is not SE of z.

- For x S z, we need:
  - supy(x) <= infy(z): 2 <= 5 (true)
  - infx(z) <= infx(x): 0 <= 9 (true)
  - supx(x) <= supx(z): 10 <= 10 (true)
  All conditions are met, so x S z is a valid relation.

So, indeed, x S z is a possible relation. But I claimed x SE z is also possible, so let's try another example with different coordinates.

Let's modify the previous example:
- z spans from (0, 5) to (10, 10).
- y spans from (5, 0) to (8, 3).
- x spans from (15, 1) to (18, 2).

Let's check:
- For x E y, we need:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x): 8 <= 15 (true)
  - infy(y) <= infy(x): 0 <= 1 (true)
  - supy(x) <= supy(y): 2 <= 3 (true)
  OK, x E y is satisfied.

- For y S z, we need:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z): 3 <= 5 (true)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y): 0 <= 5 (true)
  - supx(y) <= supx(z): 8 <= 10 (true)
  OK, y S z is satisfied.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- For x SE z, we need:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x): 10 <= 15 (true)
  - supy(x) <= infy(z): 2 <= 5 (true)
  All conditions are met, so x SE z is a valid relation.

So, both x S z and x SE z are possible relations, depending on the exact positions of the regions. Here's another example where supx(z) = infx(x), showing that x SE z also holds for a borderline case:

- z spans from (0, 5) to (10, 10).
- y spans from (2, 0) to (8, 3).
- x spans from (10, 1) to (12, 2).

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- For x SE z, we need:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x): 10 <= 10 (true)
  - supy(x) <= infy(z): 2 <= 5 (true)
  All conditions are met, so x SE z is a valid relation.

But I wonder if other relations are possible. Let's check:

E:
- For x E z, we need:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x): (true, it can be)
  - infy(z) <= infy(x): 5 <= 1 (false)
  - supy(x) <= supy(z): 2 <= 10 (true)
  The second condition is not met, so x E z is not a valid relation. (We've already shown x is below z, which contradicts being to the east).

NE:
- For x NE z, we need:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x): (true, it can be)
  - supy(z) <= infy(x): 10 <= 1 (false)
  The second condition is not met, so x NE z is not a valid relation.

SW:
- For x SW z, we need:
  - supx(x) <= infx(z): (it's not clear if this is true or false for arbitrary positions, so let's check with the constraints)
  
  From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which means the right edge of y is to the left of the left edge of x. This tells us that x is entirely to the right of y.
  
  From y S z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), which means the left edge of z is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of y.
  
  Combining these, we get: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This implies infx(z) <= infx(x). But this is the opposite of what we need for x SW z, which requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Since infx(x) <= supx(x) by definition, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).
  
  So, x cannot be SW of z.

Based on the constraints and the concrete examples, I believe the possible relations between x and z are S and SE. I have demonstrated both with valid examples.

Actually, let's rigorously prove that SW is not a possible relation.

Suppose we have regions x, y, and z and suppose the following constraints hold:
- x E y (i.e. supx(y) ≤ infx(x) ∧ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ∧ supy(x) ≤ supy(y))
- y S z (i.e. supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ∧ infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ∧ supx(y) ≤ supx(z))

Now suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that x SW z (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ∧ supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).

We've already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so that part is consistent. But we need to check if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is consistent with the given constraints.

From x E y, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x).
From y S z, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y).

If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then given supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we would have supx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

But from y S z, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y). So, infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y), where the last inequality is true by definition.

This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y), which is a contradiction unless supx(y) = infx(z) = infx(y) = supx(y).

OK wait, that's allowed. If infx(z) = infx(y) = supx(y) then as long as infx(x) > supx(y), both x SW z and x E y are satisfied.

But with infx(z) = infx(y) = supx(y), the regions y and z have their edges exactly aligned, and both of them are single-dimensional, which doesn't seem like a regular 2D region. Let me re-think this.

Actually, the proof I gave has an error. If we suppose supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then along with supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This, combined with infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y), gives us supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y), which as I noted is a contradiction unless supx(y) = infx(z) = infx(y) = supx(y).

If supx(y) = infx(z) = infx(y) = supx(y), then we have infx(y) = supx(y), which means that the region y has zero width, which is not possible for regions in REG.

Let's try to construct an example where it seems like x SW z is satisfied along with the given constraints.

Say:
- z spans from (5, 5) to (10, 10).
- y spans from (5, 0) to (5, 3).  (Note: this isn't a valid REG because it has zero width)
- x spans from (0, 1) to (4, 2).

Let's check the constraints:
- For x E y, we need:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x): 5 <= 0 (false)
  The first condition is not met, so x E y is not satisfied.

So, it doesn't seem possible to have a valid REG where x SW z, x E y, and y S z are all satisfied.

Let's also check if x W z is possible.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or aligned with the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or aligned with the top edge of z)

As shown in the proof above, the constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) leads to a contradiction or requires the region y to have zero width, which is not possible for regions in REG.

So, x W z is also not a possible relation.

OK so the possible single-tile relations are S and SE. Is S:SE a sensible multi-tile relation? That would require:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z, from the S constraint)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z, from the S constraint)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z, from the SE constraint)

But supx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) imply supx(z) <= supx(z), which is a tautology. So S:SE is not a valid multi-tile relation; it's redundant and is just described by S.

Wait, that's not right. Let me try again. For S:SE, we'd need a region x that's partly S of z and partly SE of z. This would mean that infx(x) < supx(z), making part of x overlap with z's x-range (the S part), while another part of x extends to the right beyond z's right edge (the SE part).

My mistake was in trying to reconcile the constraints. For a multi-tile relation, we're looking at different parts of the same region satisfying different tiles.

OK Actually I think there's some redundancy for multi-tile relations in the definition. Let me construct a region that's partially S of z and partially SE of z, and see if it satisfies all the constraints.

- z spans from (0, 5) to (10, 10).
- y spans from (2, 0) to (8, 3).
- x spans from (9, 1) to (15, 2).

Let's check:
- For x E y, we need:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x): 8 <= 9 (true)
  - infy(y) <= infy(x): 0 <= 1 (true)
  - supy(x) <= supy(y): 2 <= 3 (true)
  OK, x E y is satisfied.

- For y S z, we need:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z): 3 <= 5 (true)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y): 0 <= 2 (true)
  - supx(y) <= supx(z): 8 <= 10 (true)
  OK, y S z is satisfied.

Now, part of x (from (9, 1) to (10, 2)) is S of z, while another part (from (10, 1) to (15, 2)) is SE of z. This represents a multi-tile relation, where x is both S and SE of z.

So, it seems that the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (single-tile)
- SE (single-tile)
- S:SE (multi-tile)

But wait, the question is asking about the possible single-tile relations that can occur. Let's revise all the single-tile relations:

S: We've already shown this is possible with a concrete example.
SE: We've already shown this is possible with a concrete example.
SW: We've proven this is not possible.
W: We've proven this is not possible.
NW: Given that x is below z, this is not possible.
N: Given that x is below z, this is not possible.
NE: Given that x is below z, this is not possible.
E: Given that x is below z, this is not possible.
B: Given that x is below z, this is not possible.

So, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are S and SE. Since I'm asked to list the possible answers, I'll say S and SE.

Wait, let me double check if E could also be possible. Technically, if the y-coordinates of x and z overlap, then x E z could be a valid relation.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or aligned with the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or aligned with the top edge of z)

From x E y and y S z, we have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies that the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. This contradicts the second condition for x E z, which requires infy(z) <= infy(x).

So, x E z is not a possible relation.

Let's also check if x could be in the bounding box of z.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or aligned with the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or aligned with the top edge of z)

From x E y and y S z, we have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies that the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. This contradicts the third condition for x B z, which requires infy(z) <= infy(x).

So, x B z is not a possible relation.

So, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are S and SE.

Wait, let me check if x S z is possible or if x might be S:SE of z (multi-tile) but not just S of z (single-tile).

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or aligned with the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z)

We've shown that supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x). But for supx(x) <= supx(z), do we have a guarantee? From y S z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z). From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).

So, we don't have a direct constraint that ensures supx(x) <= supx(z). But if we choose infx(x) and supx(x) such that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), then x S z is possible.

I've already demonstrated this with a concrete example where x spans from (9, 1) to (10, 2) and z spans from (0, 5) to (10, 10). In this example, supx(x) = 10, which is equal to supx(z) = 10, so the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) is satisfied.

So, yes, x S z is a possible relation.

I hope I haven't been bouncing around too much. To recap, we've carefully analyzed the constraints and considered concrete examples. The possible single-tile relations between x and z are S and SE. And we've also seen that it's possible for x to be S:SE of z, which is a multi-tile relation.

To summarize, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are:
- S (South)
- SE (Southeast)

Right, so the answer is S and SE.

Actually, now that I think about it, let me check if there's an issue with some of my reasoning.

For x E y, I interpreted supx(y) <= infx(x) to mean x is entirely to the right of y. But let me further check if we could have part of x overlapping with y.

Actually, I misunderstood the definition. The definition "a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a)" means that the entire region a is to the right of the entire region b.

Similarly, for y S z, the definition "a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b)" means that the entire region a is below the entire region b.

So, my interpretation has been correct. The possible single-tile relations between x and z are indeed S and SE.

Let's also double-check the relation S:SE, which I thought was possible. For a region to be a valid REG, it must be homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which means it's a connected region.

If part of x is S of z and another part is SE of z, then for the relation to be S:SE, both parts must be significant. Specifically, the part of x that's S of z should have a non-zero area, and the part of x that's SE of z should also have a non-zero area.

But thinking about it again, I'm not fully convinced that S:SE is a valid multi-tile relation. Let me check the definition:

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

Actually, I think I can see where my confusion was coming from. For a relation to be multi-tile, you'd need to partition the region into multiple regions, each of which has a single-tile relation with the reference region. If x can be partitioned into two regions, one of which is S of z and the other is SE of z, then x is S:SE of z.

Regardless, the question asked for possible single-tile relations, which are S and SE.

So, the answer is: S and SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- x is E of y
- y is S of z

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From "x is E of y":
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is completely to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-range is within y's y-range)

From "y is S of z":
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is completely below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-range is within z's x-range)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so x is below z
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), so the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of z

The possible relations are:

1. S: When x is below z and x's x-range is within z's x-range
   This happens when: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)

2. SE: When x is below z and completely to the right of z
   This happens when: supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x)

S, SE
