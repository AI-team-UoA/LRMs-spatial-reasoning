PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me solve this step by step.

We know that:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Now we need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's use the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- SE relation: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So, we have:
1. x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relation between x and z.

For the x-coordinates:
- From (1): supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From (2): supx(z) <= infx(y)

Combining these: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, supx(z) <= infx(x)

For the y-coordinates:
- From (1): supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From (2): supy(y) <= infy(z)

But we can't directly combine these to determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Let me draw this out visually to understand better:

If x is SE of y:
- x is to the right of y (supx(y) <= infx(x))
- x is below y (supy(x) <= infy(y))

If y is SE of z:
- y is to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(y))
- y is below z (supy(y) <= infy(z))

So, x is to the right of y, which is to the right of z.
And x is below y, which is below z.

This means x is to the right of z and below z. 

Given these constraints, x can be:
- SE of z (if x is strictly to the right and strictly below z)
- E of z (if x is strictly to the right of z, but vertically overlapping with z)
- S of z (if x is strictly below z, but horizontally overlapping with z)

Let's check if there are any other possibilities:

Could x be NE of z? No, because x is below y, which is below z, so x cannot be above z.
Could x be N of z? No, for the same reason.
Could x be NW of z? No, for the same reason and also because x is to the right of z.
Could x be W of z? No, because x is to the right of y, which is to the right of z, so x cannot be to the left of z.
Could x be SW of z? No, because x is to the right of z.
Could x be B of z? No, because x is strictly to the right of z, so it cannot be within the bounding box of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SE (South East)
- E (East)
- S (South)

Actually, let me double-check the S and E relations:

E relation: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (we don't know this from the given information)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (we don't know this from the given information)

S relation: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (we can't directly infer this from the given information)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (we don't know this from the given information)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (we don't know this from the given information)

Wait, I think I made an error in my reasoning. Let me redo this more carefully.

From the given:
- x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For the x-coordinates:
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
Combining: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
So, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z.

For the y-coordinates:
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y SE z: supy(y) <= infy(z)
We can't directly combine these to infer the relation between supy(x) and infy(z).

Actually, I'm realizing there's a clearer way to think about this. 

If we're looking at the cardinal directions in a compass, then:
- SE means "South East" (down and to the right)
- If x is SE of y, and y is SE of z, then x is further south and further east of z than y is.

So, x is definitely to the east (right) of z. And x is definitely to the south (below) of z.

Hmm, but this doesn't tell us the exact relation between x and z. It could be SE, E, or S, depending on the specific positions of the regions.

Actually, wait. Let's reconsider the properties of these regions. They are regions in REG, which means they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. They are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries.

Given that x is SE of y and y is SE of z, and considering the properties of these regions, let's list the possible relations between x and z:

1. SE: This is definitely possible. If x is strictly to the right and strictly below z, then the relation is SE.
2. E: This is possible if x is strictly to the right of z and vertically overlaps with z.
3. S: This is possible if x is strictly below z and horizontally overlaps with z.
4. B: This is not possible because x is strictly to the right of z, so it cannot be within the bounding box of z.
5. NE, N, NW, W, SW: These are not possible because of the constraints on the positions of x and z.

But I'm not sure if E or S are actually possible given the definitions of the cardinal direction relations. Let me check:

E relation: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

S relation: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) 
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

Let's actually reason about this more carefully using the specific definitions.

From the given:
- x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For the x-coordinates:
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
Combining: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z.

For the y-coordinates:
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y SE z: supy(y) <= infy(z)
We can't directly combine these to infer the relation between supy(x) and infy(z).

Actually, I think I need to be even more careful when applying these relations.

Let's use the definitions:

- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

If x SE y, then:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)

If y SE z, then:
supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

1. x SE z: 
   - Need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From what we know: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z). 
   But without knowing the specific values, we can't directly infer supy(x) <= infy(z).

   Actually, let's think about this differently. If supy(x) > infy(z), then x overlaps with z in the y-direction, which would contradict the fact that x is SE of y and y is SE of z (because x would then be at least partially "north" of z). But given that we're dealing with regions, this logic doesn't necessarily hold, because regions can have complex shapes.

Let me approach this more systematically. I'll consider each possible relation between x and z and see if it's consistent with the given constraints.

1. x SE z:
   - Need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From what we know: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we don't have direct information. But it's at least possible that this condition is satisfied.

2. x E z:
   - Need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From what we know: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.
   - For infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), we don't have direct information. But it's at least possible that these conditions are satisfied.

3. x S z:
   - Need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - From what we know: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (because if supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(z) <= supx(x) cannot be satisfied). So, x cannot be S of z.

This suggests that the possible relations are SE and E. Let's continue checking the other relations.

4. x SW z:
   - Need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From what we know: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

5. x W z:
   - Need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From what we know: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

6. x NW z:
   - Need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - From what we know: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be NW of z.

7. x N z:
   - Need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - From what we know: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

8. x NE z:
   - Need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - From what we know: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have direct information. But it's at least possible that this condition is satisfied.

9. x B z:
   - Need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From what we know: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

So, it appears that the possible relations between x and z are SE, E, and NE.

Let me double-check the NE relation:

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is satisfied based on our derivation)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

These don't directly tell us about the relation between supy(z) and infy(x). So, it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x), which would make x NE of z.

Actually, let's reason about this from a more intuitive perspective. 

If x is SE of y, then x is to the right and below y. 
If y is SE of z, then y is to the right and below z.

So, x is to the right of y, which is to the right of z. And x is below y, which is below z.

This means x is to the right of z, but the vertical relationship is less clear. x is below y, which is below z, but that doesn't necessarily mean x is below z.

Given these constraints:
- x is definitely to the right of z.
- x could be below, at the same height, or above z, depending on the specific positions.

This corresponds to the relations:
- SE (if x is to the right and below z)
- E (if x is to the right and at the same height as z)
- NE (if x is to the right and above z)

But wait, there's another way to think about this. If x is to the right and below y, and y is to the right and below z, then x is "more to the right" and "more below" compared to z than y is. So, x is definitely to the right and below z, which would mean the relation is SE.

Actually, let me reason about this more precisely using the definitions:

If x SE y, then:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)

If y SE z, then:
supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For the x-coordinates:
From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
From y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
Combining: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, supx(z) <= infx(x)

For the y-coordinates:
From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
From y SE z: supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, I need to determine if these constraints allow for x to be SE, E, or NE of z.

For x SE z:
Need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
We've established supx(z) <= infx(x).
For supy(x) <= infy(z), we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
We can't directly infer supy(x) <= infy(z) from these.

For x E z:
Need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
We've established supx(z) <= infx(x).
For infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), we don't have direct information.

For x NE z:
Need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
We've established supx(z) <= infx(x).
For supy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have direct information.

Alright, for vertical relations, the constraints don't strictly determine whether x is above, at the same height, or below z. It depends on the specific positions. let me draw out some position of x, y, and z to see if I understand the constraints. Note that I make the assumption that the origin is at the bottom-left and y values increase as we move up.

First let's establish that we know these things:

supx(z) <= infx(y) : This means that z is stricty to the left of y.
supy(y) <= infy(z) : This means that y is strictly below z.
supx(y) <= infx(x) : This means that y is stricty to the left of x.
supy(x) <= infy(y) : This means that x is strictly below y.

Combine the first and third constraints,

supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) : This means that z is strictly to the left of y, which is strictly to the left of x. And thus z is strictly to the left of x.

Here's how I imagine the constraints:

z: a region in the top-left
y: a region to the bottom-right of z, but still the the left of x
x: a region to the bottom-right of y

Now, I need to determine if x can be SE, E, or NE of z.

For x SE z:
Need: supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
We've established that x is to the right of z.
For the vertical constraint, we know:
supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)
Combining them: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z)
So, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z. Since x is to the right of z and below z, the relation is SE.

But wait. Did I correctly combine the vertical constraints? Let me double-check. We have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) means that the top of x is below the bottom of y.
supy(y) <= infy(z) means that the top of y is below the bottom of z.

If the top of x is below the bottom of y, and the top of y is below the bottom of z, then the top of x is below the bottom of z. So, supy(x) <= infy(z).

Actually, let me clarify the constraints one more time.

We know that:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

For cardinal direction relation SE (SouthEast), the definition says:
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So:
- For x SE y, we have: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- For y SE z, we have: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can combine the constraints to get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x is to the right of z.
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x is below z.

Wait, there's an error in this combination. We have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

These don't directly combine to get supy(x) <= infy(z). We would need supy(x) <= supy(y) (which we don't have) to make that combination.

Hmm, let me rethink this.

If we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (the top of x is below the bottom of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (the top of y is below the bottom of z)

Then, the top of x is below the bottom of y, and the top of y is below the bottom of z. It follows that the top of x is below the bottom of z. So, supy(x) <= infy(z).

This makes x SE of z.

But wait, are there other possible positions? I was thinking primarily of a scenario where z is in the top-left, y is in the middle, and x is in the bottom-right. But there could be other configurations.

Let's reason through this more carefully:

1. x SE y means: x is to the right of y and below y.
2. y SE z means: y is to the right of z and below z.

From these, we can definitely conclude that:
- x is to the right of z (transitivity of "is to the right of").
- x is below z (transitivity of "is below").

The cardinal direction relation that corresponds to "is to the right of and below" is SE. So, the relation between x and z is SE.

But let's double-check this for robustness.

For SE, we have: x SE z iff supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We've shown that supx(z) <= infx(x).

For supy(x) <= infy(z), we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) (top of x is below bottom of y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (top of y is below bottom of z)

It's not immediately obvious that this ensures supy(x) <= infy(z), but if we think about it spatially, if the top of x is below the bottom of y, and the top of y is below the bottom of z, then the top of x is definitely below the bottom of z. So, supy(x) <= infy(z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z must be SE.

Actually, I don't think that's right. I think I'm making an error.

I got it now: 

Let's use the definition again: 
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So:
1. x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From (1) and (2), we can combine the x-coordinates to get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us supx(z) <= infx(x). This ensures that x is to the right of z.

For the y-coordinates, we can't directly combine the inequalities. Here's why:

From (1), we have: supy(x) <= infy(y)
From (2), we have: supy(y) <= infy(z)

These don't directly give us a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). If we had supy(x) <= supy(y), then we could say:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which would give us supy(x) <= infy(z).

But we don't have that relation. 

Hmm, let me try a different way.

From the conditions x SE y and y SE z, we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y) implies that y is to the left of x, and the top of x is below the bottom of y.
2. supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) implies that z is to the left of y, and the top of y is below the bottom of z.

The relative positions of x, y, and z could be visualized as follows (considering their minimum bounding boxes):

    z
      y
        x

Here, z is in the top-left, y is in the middle, and x is in the bottom-right (this is just one possible arrangement).

In this visualization, it's clear that x is to the right of z (which aligns with our algebraic derivation: supx(z) <= infx(x)).

But what about the vertical positioning? In this visualization, x appears below z, but our algebraic constraints didn't directly tell us that.

Let's try to use more intuitive reasoning: if the top of x is below the bottom of y, and the top of y is below the bottom of z, then the top of x is below the bottom of z. This gives us: supy(x) <= infy(z), ensuring that x is below z.

So, the relation between x and z is SE.

Wait, OK. I think I got to the right answer but I messed up the reasoning. Let me redo it.

From the constraints:
1. x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For the x-coordinates:
From (1): supx(y) <= infx(x)
From (2): supx(z) <= infx(y)
Combining them: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), giving us supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the y-coordinates:
From (1): supy(x) <= infy(y)
From (2): supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, to determine the relation between supy(x) and infy(z), I need to consider the transitivity of the "is below" relation:
- If the top of x is below the bottom of y (supy(x) <= infy(y)),
- And the top of y is below the bottom of z (supy(y) <= infy(z)),
- Then the top of x is below the bottom of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)).

Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z). This ensures that x is below z.

Since x is to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)) and below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), the relation between x and z is SE.

Actually, I think I was mostly right. SE is one possible relation between x and z, but there are others. Let me redo this analysis more carefully.

From the constraints:
1. x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For the x-coordinates:
From (1): supx(y) <= infx(x)
From (2): supx(z) <= infx(y)
Combining them: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), giving us supx(z) <= infx(x).

This says that x is to the right of z.

For the y-coordinates:
From (1): supy(x) <= infy(y)
From (2): supy(y) <= infy(z)

However, these constraints don't directly tell us about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). 

Let's check if x can be SE of z.

For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
- We already know supx(z) <= infx(x).
- For supy(x) <= infy(z), we don't have direct information, but it's possible. If the top of x is far enough below the bottom of y, and the top of y is far enough below the bottom of z, then the top of x could be below the bottom of z. So, SE is a valid possibility.

But I think SE might not be the only valid relation. Let me check if there is another relation that are also valid.

Let's check if x can be E of z.

For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- We already know supx(z) <= infx(x).
- For infy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have direct constraints. It's possible for z to be at the same height as or below x (infy(z) <= infy(x)) if the bottom of y is  high enough (still keeping supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)).
- For supy(x) <= supy(z), similarly, we don't have direct constraints. It's possible.

But if infy(z) <= infy(x), can we still ensure that supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)? Let's check:

supy(x) <= infy(y) (top of x is below bottom of y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (top of y is below bottom of z)

Now, can infy(z) <= infy(x)? This means the bottom of z is below or at the same height as the bottom of x. If the bottom of z is below the bottom of x, and the top of y is below the bottom of z, then the top of y is also below the bottom of x. This is consistent with supy(y) <= infy(x).

Similarly, for supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is below or at the same height as the top of z), it's possible as long as the top of x is still below the bottom of y and the top of y is below the bottom of z.

So, x E z is also a valid possibility.

Let's also check for x NE z.

For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- We already know supx(z) <= infx(x).
- For supy(z) <= infy(x), this means the top of z is below the bottom of x. But if the top of z is below the bottom of x, and the top of y is below the bottom of z, then the top of y is also below the bottom of x. This would mean y is completely below x, which contradicts x SE y. So, x NE z is not a valid possibility.

Actually, let me recheck that. Yeah, I think this is right: if the top of z is below the bottom of x, and the top of y is below the bottom of z, then the top of y is below the bottom of x. This contradicts x SE y, because if we need supy(x) <= infy(y), which means top of x is below the bottom of y. So if y is completely below x, then this condition is violated.

OK so NE is not a valid possibility.

Let's also check for x S z:

For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- For supy(x) <= infy(z), it's possible, as we've discussed.
- For infx(z) <= infx(x), this means the left edge of z is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of x. This is consistent with z being to the left of x.
- For supx(x) <= supx(z), this means the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z. But we know supx(z) <= infx(x) from our earlier derivation, which means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. This contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, x S z is not a valid possibility.

Let's check for x SW z:

For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
- For supx(x) <= infx(z), this means the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z. But we know supx(z) <= infx(x) from our earlier derivation, which means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. These two conditions contradict each other.

So, x SW z is not a valid possibility.

Let's check for x W z:

For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- For supx(x) <= infx(z), this means the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z. But we know supx(z) <= infx(x) from our earlier derivation, which means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. These two conditions contradict each other.

So, x W z is not a valid possibility.

Let's check for x NW z:

For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- For supx(x) <= infx(z), this means the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z. But we know supx(z) <= infx(x) from our earlier derivation, which means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. These two conditions contradict each other.

So, x NW z is not a valid possibility.

Let's check for x N z:

For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- For supy(z) <= infy(x), as we've discussed, this contradicts x SE y.
- For infx(z) <= infx(x), this is possible.
- For supx(x) <= supx(z), this would contradict the condition supx(z) <= infx(x).

So, x N z is not a valid possibility.

Let's check for x B z:

For x B z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- For infx(z) <= infx(x), this is possible.
- For supx(x) <= supx(z), this contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x).

So, x B z is not a valid possibility.

Based on our analysis, the valid relations between x and z are:
- SE
- E

Actually, let me reason about some of these again.

For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- From our earlier derivation, we have established that supx(z) <= infx(x). This means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x.
- For supx(x) <= supx(z), this means the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z.

But if the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x, then the right edge of z is definitely to the left of the right edge of x. This means supx(z) <= supx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for x S z.

So, x S z is not a valid possibility.

I've checked all the cardinal directions, and the only valid relations between x and z are:
- SE
- E

But now I'm confused: what's an example where the relation would be E?

Let's think about a basic example to see if E is possible:

If x is SE of y:
- x is to the right of y.
- x is below y.

If y is SE of z:
- y is to the right of z.
- y is below z.

So, x is to the right of z, but the vertical relationship is less clear.

For x to be E of z, we would need:
- x to be to the right of z (which is ensured).
- x to be vertically aligned with z (neither strictly above nor strictly below).

Is it possible for x to be vertically aligned with z given the other constraints?

We would need:
- x to be below y (from x SE y).
- z to be above y (from y SE z).
- x to be vertically aligned with z.

Visualizing this, it seems hard to satisfy all these conditions. But is it possible?

I think E is only possible if we're considering regions with complex shapes. For example, imagine x, y and z as L-shaped regions.

Actually I think I'm making this harder than it is. First let's remember how cardinal directions work. I am treating the regions in the 2D plane where the origin is at the bottom-left corner, positive x is right and positive y is upward.

To be SE is to be "South East", or down and to the right.
To be E is to be "East", or directly to the right.

Now let's think about the constraints based on how I understand the definition:

If x is to the southeast of y, then x is both to the right of and below y.
If y is to the southeast of z, then y is both to the right of and below z.

So, x is to the right of y, which is to the right of z. This means x is to the right of z.
And x is below y, which is below z. This means x is below z.

If x is both to the right of and below z, then x is to the southeast of z!

Let's use the definition. We have:
- x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

For the x-coordinates:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), giving us supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x is to the right of z.

For the y-coordinates:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Hmm, I'm still not seeing the direct implication for the vertical relationship between x and z. Let me try visualization. Here are the y-axis constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y): the top of x is below the bottom of y.
- supy(y) <= infy(z): the top of y is below the bottom of z.

These two constraints mean:
1. The top of x is below the bottom of y.
2. The top of y is below the bottom of z.

Taking (1) and (2) together, it's reasonable to conclude that the top of x is below the bottom of z, which would be supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x is below z.

Actually I think my struggle is due to not considering the transivity of the constraints. Actually the constraints are:

1. supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For the x-coordinates, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the y-coordinates, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
This means supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, we have:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

By the definition of the SE relation, this means x SE z.

Wait, did I get the correct relation: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)?

Actually, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

There isn't a direct relation between infy(y) and supy(y) from the given constraints. So, I can't make the direct claim that supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).

OK let me think about this geometrically again:

If the top of x is below the bottom of y, and the top of y is below the bottom of z, it's reasonable to conclude that the top of x is below the bottom of z. But to make the formal proof I need to use transitivity of the vertical relationship.

If supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), then can we claim supy(x) <= infy(z)?

Given supy(x) <= infy(y), we have supy(x) <= infy(y), OK this is obvious.
Given supy(y) <= infy(z), we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

I still need to establish the relation between infy(y) and supy(y). In general, since y is a region, it must be the case that infy(y) <= supy(y). This is because the bottom of y is below the top of y.

OK, I think the answer is right: the relation is x SE z. Let me explain why.

Given:
- x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

For the x-coordinates:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), giving us supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x is to the right of z.

For the y-coordinates:
supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

For y to be a region, we need infy(y) <= supy(y). Combining these:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x is below z.

Given supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), by the definition of the SE relation, x SE z.

So, the relation between x and z is SE.

Actually, I'm not so sure about this. Let me revisit the E relation.

For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- We already know supx(z) <= infx(x).
- For infy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have direct constraints. It's possible that the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x.
- For supy(x) <= supy(z), we don't have direct constraints. It's possible that the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z.

Can these conditions be satisfied along with the given constraints?

supy(x) <= infy(y) (top of x is below bottom of y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (top of y is below bottom of z)

For E to be satisfied, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This gives us:
infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z).

This implies that x and z overlap vertically, which means some part of x is directly to the right of some part of z. But if x is directly to the right of z, and y is strictly to the southeast of z, then y is below and to the right of z. It's hard to place x to the southeast of y in this scenario.

Let's try a visual example. Imagine z as a rectangle in the top-left, y as a rectangle in the middle, and x as a rectangle in the bottom-right. For y to be SE of z, it's to the right and below. For x to be SE of y, it's to the right and below. Given this, x would be to the right and below z, which means the relation is SE not E.

It's hard to create a concrete example where the relation would be E given the constraints that x is SE of y and y is SE of z.

Actually, let me check one more time.

If x to the right of z, then it could be SE, E, or NE of z. But given the additional constraints, here are the vertical positions of x, y, and z:
- z is above y (from y SE z).
- y is above x (from x SE y).
- Therefore, z is above x.

This places x below z (SW, S, or SE). Combining this with the fact that x is to the right of z, the only possible relation is SE.

To sum up, given that x is SE of y and y is SE of z, the relation between x and z is SE.

Actually, I'm still having doubts. Let me check one more time.

From the relation x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (the rightmost edge of y is to the left of the leftmost edge of x).
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (the highest point of x is below the lowest point of y).

From the relation y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (the rightmost edge of z is to the left of the leftmost edge of y).
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (the highest point of y is below the lowest point of z).

For the x-coordinates, we combine to get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), giving us supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the y-coordinates, given:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (the highest point of x is below the lowest point of y).
- infy(y) <= supy(y) (inherent for a region: the lowest point is below the highest point).
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (the highest point of y is below the lowest point of z).

This combination gives us:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z).

Given supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), by the definition of the SE relation, x SE z.

Therefore, the definite relation between x and z is SE.

I'm getting confused on whether the relation can be E or not. Let me try a specific example to be certain.

Let's represent x, y, and z as specific rectangles (just for clarity). Suppose:
- z is located at (0, 6) to (2, 8).
- y is located at (3, 3) to (5, 5).
- x is located at (6, 0) to (8, 2).

For z:
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 6, supy(z) = 8.

For y:
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 5, infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 5.

For x:
- infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 8, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 2.

Checking if y is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= 3 = infx(y). Yes.
- supy(y) = 5 <= 6 = infy(z). Yes.
So, y is SE of z.

Checking if x is SE of y:
- supx(y) = 5 <= 6 = infx(x). Yes.
- supy(x) = 2 <= 3 = infy(y). Yes.
So, x is SE of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z.

For SE:
- supx(z) = 2 <= 6 = infx(x). Yes.
- supy(x) = 2 <= 6 = infy(z). Yes.
So, x is SE of z.

For E:
- supx(z) = 2 <= 6 = infx(x). Yes.
- infy(z) = 6 <= 0 = infy(x). No.
- supy(x) = 2 <= 8 = supy(z). Yes.
Since the second condition is not satisfied, x is not E of z.

It seems like, for this specific example, x is SE of z, not E. But can we find an example where x could be E of z?

I've been thinking, and I'll be honest: I think the relation can only be SE, not E.

Let's approach this from a more basic perspective:

If y is SE of z, then y is below z. If x is SE of y, then x is below y. Using the transitivity of "is below", x is below z. Given that x is also to the right of z (from the x-coordinate conditions), x is to the southeast of z, i.e., x SE z.

One more time. Let me try using the definition of the cardinal direction relations. Specifically, E is the relation where x is directly to the right of z, neither strictly above nor strictly below. 

For x E z, one of the conditions is infy(z) <= infy(x). But given the constraints, we have z above y and y above x, so z is above x. It doesn't seem possible for x to be at the same height as z or for z to be lower than x.

So, the relation between x and z is SE, not E.

Actually, let me see if any of the other relations are possible too:

Let's check S:

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (we've established this).
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (we don't have direct constraints on this).
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x)).

Since the third condition contradicts our established constraint, x is not S of z.

Let's check for N, NE, NW, W, SW:

For these relations, we need:
- x to be above z for N, NE, NW.
- x to be to the left of z for NW, W, SW.

But we've established that x is below z and to the right of z, so these relations are not possible.

Let's check for B:

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (possible).
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x)).
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (contradicts the positions of x and z).
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (consistent with the positions of x and z).

Since the second condition contradicts our established constraint, x is not B of z.

Given all this analysis, the relation between x and z can only be SE.

To summarize the answer: the possible relation is SE.

Actually I think my confusion/second-guessing was because of a sign confusion. For the E relation, one of the conditions is infy(z) <= infy(x). But if z is above x, then infy(z) > infy(x), which fails the condition.

We know x is to the southeast of y, which means x is below y. And y is to the southeast of z, which means y is below z. Therefore, x is below z. Given this, and the fact that x is to the right of z, the relation is SE.

To summarize, the possible relation between x and z is SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, I'll analyze what's possible when region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z.

First, let me recall what these relations mean:
- x SE y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For the x-coordinates:
From x SE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
Combining these: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
Therefore: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

For the y-coordinates:
From x SE y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
From y SE z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
Since y is a region, we know infy(y) ≤ supy(y)
Combining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
Therefore: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Since we have both supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.
