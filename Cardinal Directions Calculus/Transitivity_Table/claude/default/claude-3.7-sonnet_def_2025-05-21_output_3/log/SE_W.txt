PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this problem step by step using the definitions provided.

First, let's recall what we're given:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is W of region z

We want to determine what could be the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions:
- x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relation between x and z.

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): z is to the east of y
- infy(z) <= infy(y): z's bottom edge is at or below y's bottom edge
- supy(y) <= supy(z): z's top edge is at or above y's top edge

Let's visualize what this looks like. We know that:
- y is to the west of z
- x is to the southeast of y

So, z is east of y, and x is southeast of y.

Given x SE y and y W z, we want to find the possible relations between x and z.

From x SE y, we know that x is to the east of y and south of y.
From y W z, we know that z is to the east of y.

Since both x and z are east of y, their relative east-west positioning is not immediately clear. x could be west of z, east of z, or they could overlap in the east-west direction.

Since x is south of y, and z can extend below y (since infy(z) <= infy(y)), the north-south positioning of x relative to z is also not immediately clear. x could be north of z, south of z, or they could overlap in the north-south direction.

Let's analyze the possible cases one by one by looking at the constraints:

1. East-West positioning of x and z:
   - Case 1: x is west of z, i.e., supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - Case 2: x is east of z, i.e., supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - Case 3: x and z overlap in the east-west direction, i.e., infx(x) < supx(z) and infx(z) < supx(x)

2. North-South positioning of x and z:
   - Case A: x is north of z, i.e., supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - Case B: x is south of z, i.e., supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - Case C: x and z overlap in the north-south direction, i.e., infy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x)

However, given the constraints, some of these cases might not be possible. Let's check:

From x SE y, we know: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
From y W z, we know: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

East-West positioning of x and z:
From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x).
From y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z).
These don't directly inform us about the east-west positioning of x relative to z. So, all east-west cases (1, 2, 3) might be possible.

North-South positioning of x and z:
From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y).
From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y).
Combining these: supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
This tells us that supy(x) (the top of x) is below or at infy(y) (the bottom of y), and infy(z) (the bottom of z) is also below or at infy(y). But this doesn't directly determine the north-south positioning of x relative to z. So, all north-south cases (A, B, C) might be possible.

Let's combine the possible east-west and north-south positionings to get the overall possible relations between x and z:

1A: x is west and north of z → x NW z
1B: x is west and south of z → x SW z
1C: x is west of z and overlaps with z in the north-south direction → x W z

2A: x is east and north of z → x NE z
2B: x is east and south of z → x SE z
2C: x is east of z and overlaps with z in the north-south direction → x E z

3A: x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is north of z → x N z
3B: x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is south of z → x S z
3C: x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and in the north-south direction → x B z (if x is inside z) or other more complex relations.

However, we need to be more careful here, as the definitions give specific constraints on the bounding boxes of the regions.

Hmm, we've made a mistake in our reasoning. Let me think about this differently:

From x SE y, we know: 
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): z is to the east of y
- infy(z) <= infy(y): z can extend below y in the south direction
- supy(y) <= supy(z): z can extend above y in the north direction

So, y is to the west of z, and x is to the southeast of y. Let me draw some representative bounding boxes for these regions to better understand the possible configurations.

The key constraints are:
- x is to the east of y
- x is to the south of y
- z is to the east of y
- z can extend below y
- z can extend above y

Given these constraints, let's see what we can determine about the relation between x and z:

1. East-West positioning:
   Since both x and z are to the east of y, x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or they could overlap in the east-west direction. We can have:
   - infx(x) < supx(z) and infx(z) < supx(x): x and z overlap in the east-west direction.
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): x is to the west of z.
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): x is to the east of z.

2. North-South positioning:
   Since x is to the south of y and z can extend below y, x could be to the north of z, to the south of z, or they could overlap in the north-south direction. We can have:
   - infy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x): x and z overlap in the north-south direction.
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): x is to the south of z.
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): x is to the north of z.

Hmm. We can have any of these cases. Maybe I'm not utilizing the constraints enough. Let me try again.

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): z is to the east of y
- infy(z) <= infy(y): z's bottom edge is at or below y's bottom edge
- supy(y) <= supy(z): z's top edge is at or above y's top edge

Let's derive some constraints on the relationship between x and z by transitivity.

East-West positioning:
From x SE y and y W z, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in the east-west direction.

So, x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or they could overlap in the east-west direction. We have all three possibilities here.

North-South positioning:
From x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y).
From y W z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y).
These suggest supy(x) <= infy(z) is not necessarily true, meaning x is not necessarily to the south of z. Similarly, supy(z) <= infy(x) is not necessarily true, meaning x is not necessarily to the north of z.

So, x and z could overlap in the north-south direction, x could be to the south of z, or x could be to the north of z.

Combining the east-west and north-south positioning, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
- S (south)
- SW (southwest)
- W (west)
- NW (northwest)
- N (north)
- NE (northeast)
- E (east)
- SE (southeast)
- B (bounding box)

Wait, this doesn't sound right. It's like we're saying any relation is possible, which seems too general. Let me reconsider the constraints more carefully.

The constraint supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z) tell us about the north-south positioning. We have:
- The top of x is below or at the bottom of y.
- The bottom of z is below or at the bottom of y.

This means the top of x is below or at the bottom of y, and the bottom of z is below or at the bottom of y. But we don't know the exact relationship between the top of x and the bottom of z, or the bottom of x and the bottom of z.

Similarly, the constraint supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y) and supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z) tell us about the east-west positioning. We have:
- x is to the east of y.
- z is to the east of y.

But this doesn't directly inform us about the east-west relationship between x and z.

Again, it looks like all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are possible, which is surprising.

We need to be more specific about the bounding boxes and their relationships based on the conditions we're given.

Let's see if direct algebraic analysis helps to narrow it down...

I think I need to draw some diagrams to better understand the possible configurations. Let me try:

```
Case 1: x is west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z))
     +------+
     |  y   |
     +------+
              +------+
              |  z   |
              +------+
       +------+
       |  x   |
       +------+
```

In this case, x is to the southeast of y, and y is to the west of z. Given the diagram, x is clearly to the southwest of z.

```
Case 2: x is east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x))
     +------+
     |  y   |
     +------+
              +------+
              |  z   |
              +------+
                      +------+
                      |  x   |
                      +------+
```

In this case, x is to the southeast of y, and y is to the west of z. Given the diagram, x is to the southeast of z.

```
Case 3: x and z overlap in the east-west direction but x is below z
     +------+
     |  y   |
     +------+
              +------+
              |  z   |
              +------+
              +------+
              |  x   |
              +------+
```

In this case, x is to the south of z.

```
Case 4: x and z overlap in both directions
     +------+
     |  y   |
     +------+
              +------+
              |  z   |
              +------+
              +---+
              | x |
              +---+
```

In this case, x could be inside z (or they could have more complex overlaps). So there could be multiple valid relationships.

```
Case 5: x and z overlap in the east-west direction but x is above z
     +------+
     |  y   |
     +------+
              +------+
              |  x   |
              +------+
              +------+
              |  z   |
              +------+
```

But wait, this doesn't satisfy our conditions! If x is southeast of y, it can't be above z if z is to the east of y. Remember, from x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). And from y W z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). This gives us supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). So, the top of x is at or below the top of z.

Actually, let's be more careful, because y west of z doesn't just say supy(y) <= supy(z), but also says infy(z) <= infy(y). So we know the north-south extent of z includes the north-south extent of y.

Hmm. Let me be more precise with bounding boxes.

From x SE y, we know:
- x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x))
- x is to the south of y (supy(x) <= infy(y))

From y W z, we know:
- y is to the west of z (supx(y) <= infx(z))
- y overlaps z in the north-south direction (infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z))

Combining these, we don't have a direct east-west relationship between x and z. So, x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or they could overlap in the east-west direction.

As for the north-south relationship, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This suggests supy(x) <= infy(z) isn't necessarily true, meaning x is not necessarily to the south of z.

Um. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let's see...

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

From supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we can't conclude anything about the north-south positioning of x and z. So, x could be to the north of z, to the south of z, or they could overlap in the north-south direction.

Similarly, from supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we don't know the direct east-west positioning of x and z. So, x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or they could overlap in the east-west direction.

Hmm, this seems to suggest all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are possible. But that would be strange to ask...

Let me try one more approach. Let's denote the bounding boxes of y, z, and x as [y_left, y_right] × [y_bottom, y_top], [z_left, z_right] × [z_bottom, z_top], and [x_left, x_right] × [x_bottom, x_top] respectively.

From x SE y, we know:
- x is to the east of y: y_right <= x_left
- x is to the south of y: x_top <= y_bottom

From y W z, we know:
- y is to the west of z: y_right <= z_left
- y overlaps z in the north-south direction: z_bottom <= y_bottom and y_top <= z_top

Now, we can use these to establish constraints on the relationship between x and z.

East-West constraints:
We know y_right <= x_left and y_right <= z_left. This doesn't establish a direct constraint between x_left and z_left, or between x_right and z_right. So, in the east-west direction, x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or they could overlap.

North-South constraints:
We know x_top <= y_bottom and z_bottom <= y_bottom. This means x_top <= z_bottom. In other words, x is to the south of z. This rules out many possible relations.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
- S (south)
- SW (southwest)
- SE (southeast)

And actually, I'm getting more specific as I refine my analysis.

But, that doesn't seem right. Let's go through it once more.

From x SE y, we know:
- y_right <= x_left
- x_top <= y_bottom

From y W z, we know:
- y_right <= z_left
- z_bottom <= y_bottom
- y_top <= z_top

The north-south constraint is x_top <= y_bottom. This tells us that the top of x is below or at the bottom of y. Also, z_bottom <= y_bottom tells us that the bottom of z is below or at the bottom of y. Combining these, we can say x_top <= z_bottom, meaning the top of x is below or at the bottom of z. This suggests x is to the south of z. And that's if both constraints are tight; in most cases, the top of x would be strictly below the bottom of z.

But I don't think that's always valid...

Actually, let me revise the North-South constraints:
We know x_top <= y_bottom and z_bottom <= y_bottom. We don't know the relationship between x_top and z_bottom. It could be x_top <= z_bottom (x is to the south of z), x_top > z_bottom (x and z overlap in the north-south direction), or x_top > z_top (x is to the north of z).

Actually, no. If x_top <= y_bottom and z_bottom <= y_bottom, then we have x_top <= y_bottom and z_bottom <= y_bottom.

Let's just go back to the basic definitions and proceed from scratch.

x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

With relation to the bounding box notation I was using:
supx(y) is y_right, infx(x) is x_left
supy(x) is x_top, infy(y) is y_bottom
infx(z) is z_left, infy(z) is z_bottom
supy(y) is y_top, supy(z) is z_top

So, rephrasing the constraints:
From x SE y, we know:
- y_right <= x_left
- x_top <= y_bottom

From y W z, we know:
- y_right <= z_left
- z_bottom <= y_bottom
- y_top <= z_top

So let's analyze the constraints:

East-West constraints:
We know y_right <= x_left and y_right <= z_left. This means both x and z are to the east of y. But there's no direct constraint between x_left and z_left, or between x_right and z_right. So, in the east-west direction, x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or they could overlap.

North-South constraints:
We know x_top <= y_bottom and z_bottom <= y_bottom. 

This means the top of x is below or at the bottom of y, and the bottom of z is below or at the bottom of y. But these constraints don't establish a direct relationship between x_top and z_bottom.

Let's think of it visually. The constraint x_top <= y_bottom means x is entirely below y. The constraint z_bottom <= y_bottom means z can extend below y. 

So here are the options:
- If z_bottom < x_top, then z is entirely above x, so x S z.
- If z_bottom = x_top, then z is just touching x from above, still x S z.
- If x_top < z_bottom and z has some part below y_bottom, then we have overlap of x and z in the north-south direction. This means we can have x SW z, x S z, or x SE z depending on the east-west relationship.

Actually, let's redo this analysis. 

We have:
x_top <= y_bottom
z_bottom <= y_bottom

These two facts together don't tell us about the relation between x_top and z_bottom.

Visually, x sits below y and z can extend below y. So, relative to z, x can be:
1. Entirely below z (x_top <= z_bottom): x S z, x SW z, or x SE z, depending on the east-west relationship.
2. Overlap with z in the north-south direction (z_bottom < x_top < z_top): This gives more possible combinations.
3. Entirely above z (z_top <= x_bottom): But this doesn't seem possible given our constraints.

I'll pick some sample coordinates to check:

For y: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
For x (southeast of y): [2, 3] × [-2, -1]
For z (east of y): [2, 3] × [-3, 2]

In this case, x and z overlap in the east-west direction, and x is to the south of z. This gives the relationship x S z.

For y: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
For x (southeast of y): [3, 4] × [-2, -1]
For z (east of y): [2, 3] × [-3, 2]

In this case, x is to the east of z, and x is to the south of z. This gives the relationship x SE z.

For y: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
For x (southeast of y): [2, 3] × [-2, -1]
For z (east of y): [4, 5] × [-3, 2]

In this case, x is to the west of z, and x is to the south of z. This gives the relationship x SW z.

So from our examples, we've shown that at least S, SW, SE are valid.

Actually, let's think about this in a bit more detail.
We have:
x_top <= y_bottom
z_bottom <= y_bottom

and we want to know if z_bottom <= x_top is necessary. Given the constraints, we can have z_bottom > x_top, meaning the bottom of z is below the top of x. This would mean x and z overlap in the north-south direction.

But wait, that's not correct. If the bottom of z is below the top of x, it means that z starts below where x ends. That doesn't mean they overlap; it means the entirety of x is below the entirety of z, which would correspond to x S z.

What I was describing is z_bottom <= x_top, which means the bottom of z is above or at the top of x. In this case, there's no north-south overlap, and x is below z.

OK!

So the North-South constraints:
We know x_top <= y_bottom and z_bottom <= y_bottom. These constraints don't establish a direct relationship between x_top and z_bottom.

So in the north-south direction, we can have:
- z_bottom > x_top: x is to the south of z.
- z_bottom <= x_top: x and z overlap in the north-south direction.

Combining this with the east-west possibilities, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
- S (south): If x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and x is to the south of z.
- SW (southwest): If x is to the west of z and x is to the south of z.
- SE (southeast): If x is to the east of z and x is to the south of z.
- W (west): If x is to the west of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.
- E (east): If x is to the east of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.
- B (bounding box): If x is inside z.

But wait, I think I missed something. Let's go back to the north-south constraints.

We have x_top <= y_bottom and z_bottom <= y_bottom. But we also have y_top <= z_top. This means the top of y is below or at the top of z.

So, we know:
- x is entirely below y (from x_top <= y_bottom).
- z can extend below y (from z_bottom <= y_bottom).
- z extends at least as high as y (from y_top <= z_top).

Given these, it's still not clear if x is entirely below z or if there's a north-south overlap. We need more constraints to determine this.

Alright, let's construct a couple of examples to understand the possible northern relationships.

Example 1 (North-South Overlap):
y_bottom = 0, y_top = 1
x_bottom = -2, x_top = 0 (x is below y)
z_bottom = -1, z_top = 2 (z extends below y and above y)

In this case, x and z overlap in the north-south direction, with x_top (0) > z_bottom (-1).

Example 2 (x South of z):
y_bottom = 0, y_top = 1
x_bottom = -2, x_top = -1 (x is below y)
z_bottom = 0, z_top = 2 (z doesn't extend below y but extends above y)

In this case, x is entirely below z, with x_top (-1) < z_bottom (0).

Both of these examples satisfy all our constraints. So, in the north-south direction, x can be to the south of z, or x and z can overlap.

Ok wait. Actually, if z_bottom <= y_bottom it doesn't mean that z_bottom < y_bottom. In fact z_bottom = y_bottom is a valid case.

Actually let me backtrack a bit. The definitions say that y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

So it means the bottom of z is below or at the bottom of y. This means the possibility that z and x overlap in the north-south direction is still valid.

Let me check again. We have:
- x_top <= y_bottom
- z_bottom <= y_bottom

If z_bottom = y_bottom, then we have x_top <= z_bottom, which means x is entirely below z.
If z_bottom < y_bottom, then we need to compare x_top and z_bottom. If x_top <= z_bottom, then x is entirely below z. If x_top > z_bottom, then x and z overlap in the north-south direction.

So, in the north-south direction, x can be entirely below z, or x and z can overlap.

Combining this with the east-west possibilities, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
- S (south): If x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and x is entirely below z.
- SW (southwest): If x is to the west of z and x is entirely below z.
- SE (southeast): If x is to the east of z and x is entirely below z.
- W (west): If x is to the west of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.
- E (east): If x is to the east of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.
- B (bounding box): Not possible given the constraint x_top <= y_bottom.

Actually, I think I've been making it too complicated. Let's break it down more clearly.

From x SE y, we know:
- x is to the east of y.
- x is to the south of y.

From y W z, we know:
- y is to the west of z.
- y and z can overlap in the north-south direction, with z possibly extending beyond y in both north and south directions.

Given these, we can say:
- In the east-west direction, both x and z are to the east of y. But the relative positioning of x and z is not determined. x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or they could overlap.
- In the north-south direction, x is to the south of y. Since z can extend below y, x and z can overlap in the north-south direction.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
- S (south): If x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and x is entirely below z.
- SW (southwest): If x is to the west of z and x is entirely below z.
- SE (southeast): If x is to the east of z and x is entirely below z.
- W (west): If x is to the west of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.
- E (east): If x is to the east of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.
- SW|S (southwest and south): If x overlaps with z in the east-west direction, with some part of x to the west of z, and x is entirely below z.
- S|SE (south and southeast): If x overlaps with z in the east-west direction, with some part of x to the east of z, and x is entirely below z.
- W|SW (west and southwest): If x is to the west of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction, with some part of x below z.
- E|SE (east and southeast): If x is to the east of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction, with some part of x below z.

But now I think I'm taking the "|" notation too literally. Let's focus on the single-tile cardinal direction relations for now.

OK. So we need to think about the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations.

From the analysis, the possible relations are:
- S (south): If x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and x is entirely below z.
- SW (southwest): If x is to the west of z and x is entirely below z.
- SE (southeast): If x is to the east of z and x is entirely below z.
- W (west): If x is to the west of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.
- E (east): If x is to the east of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.

Actually, could B (bounding box) be a possible relation?

For x B z to hold, we need:
- z_left <= x_left
- x_right <= z_right
- z_bottom <= x_bottom
- x_top <= z_top

Given the constraints:
- y_right <= x_left
- x_top <= y_bottom
- y_right <= z_left
- z_bottom <= y_bottom
- y_top <= z_top

I don't see any contradiction in adding the constraints for x B z. In other words, nothing prevents x from being inside the bounding box of z.

Actually wait. I realized I made an error, because from y W z, we would have supx(y) <= infx(z), which means y_right <= z_left. But for x to be bounding box of z, we'd need z_left <= x_left. And we also have that y_right <= x_left. But we can't have both y_right <= x_left and z_left <= x_left while also having y_right <= z_left. This doesn't make sense.

Actually I think the issue is that I'm confusing myself. Maybe B isn't even the bounding box containment relationship? Let's go back to check:

B (bounding box): a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

I think this means that a is inside the bounding box of b. So for x to be in the bounding box of z, we'd need:
- z_left <= x_left
- x_right <= z_right
- z_bottom <= x_bottom
- x_top <= z_top

Given the constraints:
- y_right <= x_left
- x_top <= y_bottom
- y_right <= z_left
- z_bottom <= y_bottom
- y_top <= z_top

So, we know y_right <= z_left. For x B z to hold, we'd need z_left <= x_left. But we also know y_right <= x_left. Having both z_left <= x_left and y_right <= x_left doesn't contradict y_right <= z_left. I think I was confused before.

Ah I understand my mistake. This constraint z_left <= x_left isn't contradicted. So B could still be a possibility.

But wait, there's more. We have x_top <= y_bottom and z_bottom <= y_bottom. For x B z to hold, we'd need z_bottom <= x_bottom and x_top <= z_top. We don't know the relationship between x_bottom and z_bottom, so it's possible that z_bottom <= x_bottom. But we know x_top <= y_bottom. For x B z to hold, we'd need x_top <= z_top, which is plausible. So, B is still a possibility.

Let's double-check. For x B z to hold, we need:
- z_left <= x_left: Since we know y_right <= z_left and y_right <= x_left, this is plausible.
- x_right <= z_right: This is not constrained by our given conditions, so it's possible.
- z_bottom <= x_bottom: We know z_bottom <= y_bottom, but we don't know the relationship between y_bottom and x_bottom, so it's possible that z_bottom <= x_bottom.
- x_top <= z_top: We know x_top <= y_bottom and y_top <= z_top. We don't know the relationship between y_bottom and y_top. But it's possible for x_top <= z_top to hold.

Actually, wait. For z_bottom <= x_bottom, we know (1) x_top <= y_bottom and (2) z_bottom <= y_bottom. But x_top is the top of x, and x_bottom is the bottom. By definition, x_bottom <= x_top. So from (1) and using this definition, we get x_bottom <= x_top <= y_bottom. From (2), we have z_bottom <= y_bottom. So, we have x_bottom <= y_bottom and z_bottom <= y_bottom. This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x_bottom and z_bottom.

So B could still be a possibility.

However, the relation "x B z" means x is inside the bounding box of z. Given the constraint x_top <= y_bottom, this means the entirety of x is below y. For x to be inside the bounding box of z, z would need to extend below y enough to encompass x. This is possible if z_bottom is sufficiently below y_bottom.

So, recapping, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
- S (south)
- SW (southwest)
- SE (southeast)
- W (west)
- E (east)
- B (bounding box)

But wait, are there any restrictions on the regions to ensure that a W|B or B|W (or other combinations like S|B, B|SW, etc.) don't arise?

Actually let's revisit the cardinal direction relation definition, to be sure. It looks like cardinal direction relation is defined as an expression R1:...:Rk where Ri can be one of the single-tile directions. The condition (iv) looks redundant with other conditions, but it seems to be saying that the union of the regions in the specified cardinal directions should be in REG. So the "|" notation means set union.

So actually, let's look at what relations could be possible for x and z:
- S: x overlaps z in the east-west direction, and x is below z.
- SE: x is east of z, and x is below z.
- SW: x is west of z, and x is below z.
- E: x is east of z, and x overlaps z in the north-south direction.
- W: x is west of z, and x overlaps z in the north-south direction.
- B: x is inside the bounding box of z.

Are any other single-tiled relation possible?

- N (north): x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), and there's east-west overlap. But we've established that x can't be above z, so this relation is not possible.
- NE (northeast): x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established that x can't be above z, so this relation is not possible.
- NW (northwest): x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established that x can't be above z, so this relation is not possible.

Actually, I stand corrected. The reason we've established that x can't be above z:

We know:
- x_top <= y_bottom (from x SE y: x is below y)
- y_top <= z_top (from y W z: z extends at least as high as y)

Using the fact that y_bottom <= y_top (by definition), we get x_top <= y_bottom <= y_top <= z_top. So, x_top <= z_top. This means that x is at or below the top of z. But this doesn't necessarily mean x is entirely below z. It just means x isn't entirely above z.

So, the relation N (and similarly NE and NW) could still be possible if x_bottom is above z_top.

Wait, but I think I'm tripping up over this. Let's try to solve this from scratch.

From x SE y, we know:
- y_right <= x_left (x is to the east of y)
- x_top <= y_bottom (x is to the south of y)

From y W z, we know:
- y_right <= z_left (z is to the east of y)
- z_bottom <= y_bottom (z can extend below y)
- y_top <= z_top (z can extend above y)

These constraints don't explicitly relate x and z in the north-south or east-west direction. So, we need to consider all possible arrangements.

In the east-west direction:
- x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or they could overlap.

In the north-south direction:
- We know x_top <= y_bottom (x is below y).
- We know z_bottom <= y_bottom (z can extend below y).
- We know y_top <= z_top (z can extend above y).

Given these, the possible scenarios in the north-south direction are:
- x is entirely below z.
- x and z overlap in the north-south direction.
- x is entirely above z.

But by using our constraints, we see that x can't be entirely above z.

Let's say x is entirely above z. Then, we would have z_top < x_bottom.
We know z_top >= y_top (from y W z). So, we have y_top <= z_top < x_bottom.
We also know x_top <= y_bottom (from x SE y). By the nature of bounding boxes, x_bottom <= x_top. So, we have x_bottom <= x_top <= y_bottom <= y_top <= z_top.
But this contradicts our assumption. So, x can't be entirely above z.

So, in the north-south direction, x can either be entirely below z, or x and z can overlap.

Combining the east-west and north-south possibilities, the possible cardinal direction relations are:
- S (south): If x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and x is entirely below z.
- SW (southwest): If x is to the west of z and x is entirely below z.
- SE (southeast): If x is to the east of z and x is entirely below z.
- W (west): If x is to the west of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.
- E (east): If x is to the east of z and x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.
- B (bounding box): If x is inside the bounding box of z.

Oh wait. There's a minor issue with the condition for B. For x B z, we need x to be inside the bounding box of z. But our constraint x_top <= y_bottom would mean that the entirety of x is below y. For x to be inside the bounding box of z, we'd need z to extend sufficiently below y, and we'd need specific positioning in the east-west direction.

Given all the constraints, let me consider some cases where we explicitly tried to arrange conditions where x B z, and see if they are feasible or if they violate any constraints.

Example (B):
y: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
z: [2, 4] × [-2, 2]
x: [3, 3.5] × [-1.5, -0.5]

In this example, x is inside the bounding box of z. And the constraints are satisfied:
- x is southeast of y: y_right (1) <= x_left (3), x_top (-0.5) <= y_bottom (0)
- y is west of z: y_right (1) <= z_left (2), z_bottom (-2) <= y_bottom (0), y_top (1) <= z_top (2)
- x is inside the bounding box of z: z_left (2) <= x_left (3), x_right (3.5) <= z_right (4), z_bottom (-2) <= x_bottom (-1.5), x_top (-0.5) <= z_top (2)

So, B is indeed a possible relation.

So, recapped, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
- S (south)
- SW (southwest)
- SE (southeast)
- W (west)
- E (east)
- B (bounding box)

OK finally let me make sure I have the right interpretation of the B relation. The definition says:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

So a B b means a is inside the bounding box of b. For x B z, we'd need z_left <= x_left, x_right <= z_right, z_bottom <= x_bottom, and x_top <= z_top. Which is what I used above.

Actually, I'm realizing that NW can be possible. Let me show an example:
y: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
x: [2, 3] × [-1, -0.5]  # x is southeast of y
z: [3.5, 4.5] × [-2, -1.5]  # z is east of y

In this example:
- x is southeast of y: y_right (1) <= x_left (2), x_top (-0.5) <= y_bottom (0)
- y is west of z: y_right (1) <= z_left (3.5), z_bottom (-2) <= y_bottom (0), y_top (1) <= z_top (-1.5)
- x is northwest of z: x_right (3) <= z_left (3.5), z_top (-1.5) <= x_bottom (-1)

Wait, that doesn't work. I got the constraint wrong. For y W z, we need y_right <= z_left (z is to the east of y), z_bottom <= y_bottom (z can extend below y), and y_top <= z_top (z can extend above y). But in my example, z's top is below y's top, which doesn't satisfy y_top <= z_top. Let's correct this:

Example (NW):
y: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
x: [2, 3] × [-1, -0.5]  # x is southeast of y
z: [3.5, 4.5] × [-2, 2]  # z is east of y

Now:
- x is southeast of y: y_right (1) <= x_left (2), x_top (-0.5) <= y_bottom (0)
- y is west of z: y_right (1) <= z_left (3.5), z_bottom (-2) <= y_bottom (0), y_top (1) <= z_top (2)
- x is northwest of z: x_right (3) <= z_left (3.5), z_top (2) <= x_bottom (-1)

But there's a contradiction here. We know x_bottom (-1) <= x_top (-0.5), so we have x_bottom (-1) <= x_top (-0.5) <= y_bottom (0) <= y_top (1) <= z_top (2). This contradicts the NW condition which requires z_top (2) <= x_bottom (-1).

So, NW is indeed not a possible relation. Similarly, N and NE would also not be possible.

Are there any other single-tile cardinal direction relations I haven't considered?

I don't think so. The nine single-tile cardinal direction relations are N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B.

So I think the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
- S (south)
- SW (southwest)
- SE (southeast)
- W (west)
- E (east)
- B (bounding box)

But let's use the cardinal direction relation definition to check I understand it properly. Are multi-tile relations possible?

I believe so. For example, consider a region that spans across W and SW. It would induce a relationship "W:SW", which, from your explanation, is what the "W|SW" notation refers to.

Actually, wait, let me read more carefully. A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where the individual Rs are the single-tile relations. The relation "W:SW" means the region has a part that's West and a part that's SouthWest.

So, multi-tile relations are possible. In our context, given the possible single-tile relations we've identified, there could be combinations like W:SW, E:SE, S:SW, S:SE, and so on.

Actually, I think the question's focus is on the cardinal directions from the list {N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B}, rather than multi-tile relations. So, for this question, the possible cardinal directions between x and z are: S, SW, SE, W, E, B.

OK, so to be clear, my final answer is:
S, SW, SE, W, E, B

To be super-confident, I'll try one more example to see if it's possible that x NW z:
y: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
x: [2, 3] × [-1, -0.5]  # x is southeast of y
z: [4, 5] × [-3, 2]  # z is east of y

Now:
- x is southeast of y: y_right (1) <= x_left (2), x_top (-0.5) <= y_bottom (0)
- y is west of z: y_right (1) <= z_left (4), z_bottom (-3) <= y_bottom (0), y_top (1) <= z_top (2)
- Is x northwest of z? We'd need x_right (3) <= z_left (4) and z_top (2) <= x_bottom (-1).

But x_bottom (-1) <= x_top (-0.5) <= y_bottom (0) <= y_top (1) <= z_top (2). This contradicts z_top (2) <= x_bottom (-1).

So, NW is not a possible relation.

OK, so I'm confident about my answer: S, SW, SE, W, E, B.

But actually, let's add some checks. What would it mean for, say, x B z? The constraint specifies that infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) must all be satisfied. So this means that z_left <= x_left, x_right <= z_right, z_bottom <= x_bottom, and x_top <= z_top.

But from our original constraints, we know:
- y_right <= x_left (from x SE y)
- x_top <= y_bottom (from x SE y)
- y_right <= z_left (from y W z)
- z_bottom <= y_bottom (from y W z)
- y_top <= z_top (from y W z)

For x B z to hold, we need z_left <= x_left. But we also know y_right <= z_left and y_right <= x_left. There's a potential contradiction here: if z_left < x_left, then we have y_right <= z_left < x_left. This means y is to the west of both x and z, which aligns with our original constraints. So, there's no contradiction.

For x B z to hold, we also need z_bottom <= x_bottom and x_top <= z_top. We know x_top <= y_bottom (from x SE y), which means the entirety of x is below y. We also know z_bottom <= y_bottom (from y W z), which means z can extend below y. For z_bottom <= x_bottom to hold, z would need to extend sufficiently beyond y in the south direction. At the same time, for x_top <= z_top to hold, z would need to extend sufficiently in the north direction.

These aren't contradicted by our known constraints, so B remains a possible relation.

So, my final answer is that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
S, SW, SE, W, E, B.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible cardinal directions between region x and region z based on the given relations, I'll analyze the constraints systematically.

Given information:
- x is SE of y
- y is W of z

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (z is to the east of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z can extend below y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z can extend above y)

Analyzing the possible positions of x relative to z:

East-West positioning:
- Both x and z are to the east of y, but their relative positions are not fixed
- x could be west of z, east of z, or they could overlap in the east-west direction

North-South positioning:
- x is entirely below y
- z can extend below y (since infy(z) ≤ infy(y))
- Therefore, x can be entirely below z, or x and z can overlap in the north-south direction

Combining these possibilities, the possible cardinal relations between x and z are:

S, SW, SE, W, E, B
