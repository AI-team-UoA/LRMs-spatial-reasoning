PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this step by step. We know:
1. Region x is S of region y
2. Region y is NE of region z

I need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's use the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

For x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

For y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, let's find the constraints on the relationship between x and z:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's see if we can derive constraints on x relative to z:

From x S y and y NE z, we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

This means supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we cannot directly infer a relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

From x S y and y NE z, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

This means that x must be to the east of z (at least partly).

Now, considering the vertical relationship:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NE z)

We don't have a direct constraint between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z).

Let's think about this geometrically. If x is south of y, and y is northeast of z, then x could be:
- East of z if x is directly south of y and y is directly northeast of z
- Southeast of z if x is south of y and slightly to the east, and y is northeast of z
- South of z if x extends far enough west while still being south of y, and y is northeast of z
- Northeast of z if x extends far enough north while still being south of y, and y is far northeast of z

I think I need to reconsider this more carefully. Let me think step by step.

Given:
- x S y: x is south of y
- y NE z: y is northeast of z

Let's draw the constraints this imposes on the bounding boxes:

For x S y:
- The northern boundary of x is below the southern boundary of y
- The western boundary of x is not to the west of the western boundary of y
- The eastern boundary of x is not to the east of the eastern boundary of y

For y NE z:
- The western boundary of y is to the east of the eastern boundary of z
- The southern boundary of y is to the north of the northern boundary of z

Now, let's see what constraints this places on the relationship between x and z:

From the west-east direction:
- The western boundary of x is not to the west of the western boundary of y
- The western boundary of y is to the east of the eastern boundary of z

This means the western boundary of x is to the east of the eastern boundary of z, which implies x must be fully to the east of z.

From the south-north direction:
- The northern boundary of x is below the southern boundary of y
- The southern boundary of y is to the north of the northern boundary of z

This doesn't give us a direct constraint between the north-south positioning of x and z. Depending on the exact positions, x could be south, at the same latitude, or north of z.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- E (East): If x is directly east of z
- SE (Southeast): If x is southeast of z
- NE (Northeast): If x is northeast of z

Actually, let me try once more and think about this in terms of the actual cardinal direction definitions given earlier. 

From the given definitions, let's analyze what we know:

x S y means:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

y NE z means:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

From x S y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
From y NE z, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

So we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we cannot directly compare supy(x) and supy(z).

From x S y, we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
From y NE z, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

Combining these, we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).
So, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the east of z (at least partly).

Let me reconsider by going back to the definitions and visualizing the scenario. 

If x is S of y, then x's north side is below y's south side, and x's west-east span is within y's west-east span. 

If y is NE of z, then y's west side is east of z's east side, and y's south side is north of z's north side.

Let's combine these:
- x's north side is below y's south side.
- y's south side is north of z's north side.
- x's west-east span is within y's west-east span.
- y's west side is east of z's east side.

So, x's west side is east of z's east side (since x's west-east span is within y's, and y's west side is east of z's east side). This means x is east of z.

As for the north-south relationship, it's not entirely clear. We know x's north side is below y's south side and y's south side is north of z's north side. This doesn't give us a direct comparison between x's north-south position and z's.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. If x's north side is below z's south side, then x is south of z, making x SE of z.
2. If x's south side is above z's north side, then x is north of z, making x NE of z.
3. If x's north side is above z's south side and x's south side is below z's north side, then x overlaps with z in the north-south direction, making x E of z.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- NE (Northeast)

Let me double-check this reasoning by going through the definitions once more. 

For x E z (East), we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

We've already established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition for E is met. The other two conditions depend on the exact positions of x and z in the north-south direction.

For x SE z (Southeast), we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition for SE is met. The second condition would be met if x is sufficiently south of z.

For x NE z (Northeast), we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition for NE is met. The second condition would be met if x is sufficiently north of z.

Given that y is NE of z, it's northeast of z. Given that x is S of y, it's south of y. Depending on the exact positions, x could be southeast, east, or northeast of z. But x is definitely east of z.

Actually, let me approach this differently. Let me draw out the scenario with bounding boxes and see if I can visualize the constraints better.

If y is NE of z, then y's bounding box is entirely to the northeast of z's bounding box, with no overlap.

If x is S of y, then x's bounding box is to the south of y's bounding box, with a possible overlap in the west-east direction.

Now, let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. x's bounding box is entirely to the east of z's bounding box. This would make x E of z.
2. x's bounding box is to the southeast of z's bounding box. This would make x SE of z.
3. x's bounding box is to the northeast of z's bounding box. This would make x NE of z.
4. x's bounding box overlaps with z's bounding box in the west-east direction, with x being south of z. This would make x S of z.
5. x's bounding box overlaps with z's bounding box in the north-south direction, with x being east of z. This would make x E of z.

Let's check which of these are compatible with our constraints:

From x S y and y NE z, we know that x's west-east span must be within y's west-east span, and y must be east of z. This suggests that x must also be east of z.

But let's check this with the constraints more carefully:

From x S y, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can infer:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This suggests x is to the east of z.

Now, let's consider the north-south direction:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NE z)

From these, we cannot directly infer a relation between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z). This means x could be south, at the same latitude, or north of z, depending on the exact positions.

So, based on our constraints, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- E (East): If x is directly east of z
- SE (Southeast): If x is southeast of z
- NE (Northeast): If x is northeast of z
- S (South): If x is directly south of z
- SW (Southwest): If x is southwest of z
- B (Bounding Box): If x is inside the bounding box of z

Let me double-check this with the definitions.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but the other conditions depend on the exact positions of x and z in the north-south direction.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition is met. The second condition would be met if x is sufficiently south of z.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so the first condition is met. The second condition would be met if x is sufficiently north of z.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

But we've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (since supx(x) ≥ infx(x)). This means x cannot be S of z.

Similarly, x cannot be SW of z because being SW requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (since supx(z) ≥ infx(z)).

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

But again, we've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This means x cannot be B of z.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- NE (Northeast)

Let's once more rethink this problem. I'll review the definitions and consider all possible arrangements.

From the definition of S, if x S y, then:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From the definition of NE, if y NE z, then:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can derive the following constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in the north-south direction.

Let's think about this geometrically. We know:
- x is to the south of y, possibly overlapping in the west-east direction.
- y is to the northeast of z, which means it's completely to the northeast, with no overlap.

Given the constraints, we can determine the possible relative positions of x with respect to z.

In the west-east direction, since y is to the northeast of z, and x's west-east span is within y's, x must be east of z.

In the north-south direction, the relationship is less clear. If x is far to the south, it could be south of z (making x southeast of z). If x is not as far south, it could be at the same latitude as z (making x east of z). And if x is only slightly south of y, it could even be north of z (making x northeast of z). But we know that if y is to the northeast of z, then y's south boundary is north of z's north boundary. And if x is to the south of y, then x's north boundary is south of y's south boundary. This gives us:
- infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we still don't have a direct relation between x and z in the north-south direction.

So, x could be:
- Southeast of z (SE): If x is east and south of z.
- East of z (E): If x is directly east of z.
- Northeast of z (NE): If x is east and north of z.

Let me check each of these possibilities against the definitions to make sure.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This is satisfied from our derived constraints. OK
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This would be satisfied if x is sufficiently south of z. Possible.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This is satisfied from our derived constraints. OK
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x): This would be satisfied if x is not too far south of z. Possible.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z): This would be satisfied if x is not too far north of z. Possible.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This is satisfied from our derived constraints. OK
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x): This would be satisfied if x is sufficiently north of z. Possible.

In other words, all these three relation types are possible depending on the exact circumstances.

The case of x S z would require:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This is possible if x is sufficiently south of z. Possible.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x): This would be satisfied if x's west boundary is not too far east. Possible.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z): But we've derived supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Contradiction.

So, x cannot be S of z.

The possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- NE (Northeast)

Actually let me double-check the case of x S z again. If x S z, we need 
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From the problem we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). Since supx(z) ≤ supx(x), the third condition is not violated. But we also know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means the right side of z is to the left of the left side of x. This is a very strong constraint, and it means the regions x and z are completely non-overlapping in the west-east direction. For the relation S, we need the regions to possibly overlap in the west-east direction. So, x cannot be S of z.

Let me try another way. If x S z, it means x's bounding box is entirely to the south of z's bounding box, with a possible overlap in the west-east direction. But we've established that x's bounding box is entirely to the east of z's bounding box. So, x cannot be S of z; it must be to the east, southeast, or northeast of z.

Let's similarly check for x SW z. If x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

But we've derived supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

Let's check for x W z. If x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Again, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be W of z.

Similarly, for x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

And again, this contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be NW of z.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

We've derived supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

The only remaining possibilities are E, SE, and NE.

However, I'm confused again about the relation S. Let me go back to the definition one more time:

For a S b, we need:
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b): The top of a is below the bottom of b.
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a): The left of a is not to the left of the left of b.
- supx(a) ≤ supx(b): The right of a is not to the right of the right of b.

With our constraints, we've derived supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means the right of z is to the left of the left of x. But for a S b, we might need the left of a to be to the right of the left of b and the right of a to be to the left of the right of b. In our case, if x S z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But since x is entirely to the east of z, both of these cannot be true.

So, x cannot be S of z.

Similarly, x cannot be B of z, W of z, NW of z, N of z, or SW of z because all of these would require some kind of west-east overlap or a different positioned, which we've established is not possible due to the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- NE (Northeast)

I hope this exhaustive check has helped clearly establish the possible relations.

Let me double check one last time. 

From x S y, we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This indicates that x is completely to the east of z.

Now, in the north-south direction:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NE z)

From these, we can't directly determine the north-south relationship between x and z. It depends on the exact positioning. Here are the possible scenarios:

1. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is to the south of z, and since x is also to the east of z, the relation is SE.
2. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is to the north of z, and since x is also to the east of z, the relation is NE.
3. If infy(z) < supy(x) and infy(x) < supy(z), then x and z overlap in the north-south direction, and since x is to the east of z, the relation is E.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- NE (Northeast)

Actually, I'm doubting myself again. Let's once again consider the definition for S:

For a S b, we need:
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a)
- supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

Applying this to x S z, we would need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From the problem, we've derived supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means that the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. In other words, x is completely to the east of z.

But for x S z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). However, if x is completely to the east of z, then infx(x) > supx(z), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

So the only possible relations again are E, SE, and NE.

Actually let me double-check my thinking again for the case of S. Above I determined that S wasn't possible by reasoning that supx(x) > infx(x) > supx(z) would contradict the condition for S that supx(x) <= supx(z). Actually, I think that reasoning is incorrect. Let's explicitly consider the definitions and chain them together more formally.

From x S y, we have:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (The top of x is below the bottom of y)
2. infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (The left of x is not to the left of the left of y)
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (The right of x is not to the right of the right of y)

From y NE z, we have:
4. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (The right of z is to the left of the left of y)
5. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (The top of z is below the bottom of y)

From (2) and (4), we have:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
which means:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

From (1) and (5), we have:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
But this doesn't give us a direct relation between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z).

Now, trying to determine if x can be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Since supx(z) ≤ infx(x), we have infx(x) ≥ supx(z).
And since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) (by definition of the bounding box), we get:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x)

This means:
supx(z) ≤ supx(x)

But for S, we need:
supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
supx(x) = supx(z)

But due to the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x), we'd need infx(x) = supx(z) for this to be possible. This is a very specific case where the left edge of x coincides with the right edge of z, which seems too contrived for a general relation. Moreover, regions in REG have connected boundaries, which means they have non-zero area. If infx(x) = supx(z), it would mean that x and z share a single point or a vertical line, which is very contrived.

So, in general, x would not be S of z.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Since the relation S can include regions that potentially overlap in the west-east direction, and we've derived that x is completely to the east of z, x cannot be S of z. That's a simpler and more intuitive way to think about it.

Similarly, x cannot be:
- W, SW, NW, N of z because all of these would require a different west-east positioning than what we've derived.
- B of z because this would require x to be within the bounding box of z, which contradicts x being completely to the east of z.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- NE (Northeast)

Actually I'm being too complicated again. Let me think directly using drawing and the definitions.

We know:
- x is south of y. So x's north edge is below y's south edge, and they can overlap in the west-east direction.
- y is northeast of z. So y's west edge is to the east of z's east edge, and y's south edge is above z's north edge.

Now, where can x be relative to z?

From the fact that y is northeast of z, and x's west-east span is within y's, we know that x's west edge is to the east of z's east edge. This means x must be to the east of z. Now, x can be at various north-south positions:
- If x's north edge is below z's south edge, then x is southeast of z (SE).
- If x's south edge is above z's north edge, then x is northeast of z (NE).
- If x has some north-south overlap with z, then x is east of z (E).

These are the only possibilities. x cannot be S, SW, W, NW, N of z because these would require a different west-east positioning, which we've determined is not possible based on the given relations. x cannot be B of z because this would require x to be inside the bounding box of z, which contradicts x being to the east of z.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- NE (Northeast)

Let me quickly check once more.

The relation of "x is S of y" means x's north edge is below y's south edge, with some possible west-east overlap. The relation "y is NE of z" means y's west edge is to the east of z's east edge, and y's south edge is above z's north edge.

Given that x's west edge must be to the east of y's west edge (from the S relation), and y's west edge is to the east of z's east edge (from the NE relation), we know that x's west edge is to the east of z's east edge. This means x is completely to the east of z.

Now, in the north-south direction, the relation "x is S of y" means x's north edge is below y's south edge. The relation "y is NE of z" means y's south edge is above z's north edge. From these, we can't directly infer the north-south relation between x and z.

So, depending on the exact positions, x can be E, SE, or NE of z, as these are the only relations consistent with x being completely to the east of z.

I'm confident in the final answer:
The possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- NE (Northeast)

ANSWER:

The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is S of y and y is NE of z.

Let me analyze the constraints:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's west side is not west of y's west side)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's east side is not east of y's east side)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x must be east of z
- For the north-south relationship, we can't directly determine it from these constraints

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- E (East) - if x is directly east of z
