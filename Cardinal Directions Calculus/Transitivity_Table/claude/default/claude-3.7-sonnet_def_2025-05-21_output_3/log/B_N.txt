PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

First, let me use the definitions to understand what "x is B of y" means:
- x B y if and only if infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means that region x is completely within the minimum bounding box of region y.

Next, let me understand what "y is N of z" means:
- y N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means that region y is to the north of region z, and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Since x is B of y, x is contained within the minimum bounding box of y.
Since y is N of z, y is completely above z.

Let's see what this tells us about x relative to z:

1. Since x is within the bounding box of y, and y is north of z, x must be at or above the northern border of z. So, x cannot be south of z.

2. In terms of east-west positioning, since y's x-projection is within z's x-projection (from y N z), and x's x-projection is within y's x-projection (from x B y), then x's x-projection must also be within z's x-projection.

Let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

- N: If x is completely above z, then x N z is possible.
- NE: If x extends to the east of z and is above z, then x NE z is possible.
- NW: If x extends to the west of z and is above z, then x NW z is possible.
- E: If x is east of z and its y-projection overlaps with z's y-projection, then x E z is possible.
- W: If x is west of z and its y-projection overlaps with z's y-projection, then x W z is possible.
- B: If x is completely within the bounding box of z, then x B z is possible.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let's re-analyze considering the constraints more precisely.

From x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

These constraints tell us:
- The x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z.
- The bottom of x is above the top of z.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N: If x is completely above z, then x N z is possible.

Wait, let me double-check if other relations are possible given the constraints.

For NE or NW to be possible, x would need to extend beyond the x-projection of z. But from our combined constraints, we know that x's x-projection is within z's x-projection. So, x NE z and x NW z are not possible.

For E or W to be possible, the y-projection of x would need to overlap with the y-projection of z. But from the combined constraints, we know that the bottom of x is above the top of z, which means there's no y-overlap. So, x E z and x W z are not possible.

For B to be possible, x would need to be completely within the bounding box of z. But from the combined constraints, the bottom of x is above the top of z, so x is not within the bounding box of z. So, x B z is not possible.

Actually, I need a re-analyze, I think I misunderstood something. Let me re-read the problem.

From x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From x B y, we know that x is within the bounding box of y. And from y N z, we know that y is above z.

Given the constraints:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x B y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)

Therefore:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z.

Also:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z)

Therefore:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means that the bottom of x is above the top of z. So, x is above z.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N: Since x is above z and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z.

So, the relation between x and z is N.

Wait, I need to re-read the problem statement more carefully.

Let's go over the definitions again:

- If region x is B of region y:
  - infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

- If region y is N of region z:
  - supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

I'll now recompute the constraints on x with respect to z.

From x B y and y N z:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x B y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)

Therefore:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z.

Also:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z)

Therefore:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means that the bottom of x is above the top of z. This is a N (north) relation.

So, the relation between x and z is definitely N.

Let me check once more to make sure.

If region x is B of region y:
- x is within the bounding box of y.

If region y is N of region z:
- y is north of z.

Since x is within the bounding box of y and y is north of z, x must be north of z as well.

Actually, let's think about this more carefully. Just because x is within the bounding box of y, it doesn't necessarily mean that x is north of z. The bounding box of y can cover a larger area than just the north of z.

Given:
- x B y means x is contained within the bounding box of y.
- y N z means y is completely north of z.

Let's analyze the possible positions of x relative to z:

Vertically:
- Since y is north of z, the bottom of y is above the top of z.
- Since x is within the bounding box of y, the bottom of x is above or equal to the bottom of y.
- Therefore, the bottom of x is above the top of z.

Horizontally:
- Since y is north of z, the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z.
- Since x is within the bounding box of y, the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of y.
- Therefore, the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N: If x is completely above z and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z.

Actually, I just realized the constraints are a bit more nuanced.

From x B y:
- Horizontally: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- Vertically: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y N z:
- Horizontally: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- Vertically: supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

Therefore:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

This means the x-projection of x can be anywhere within the x-projection of z. It doesn't have to be completely contained.

Combining the vertical constraints:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

Therefore:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

This means that the bottom of x is above the top of z. So, x is above z.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N: If the x-projection of x is completely within the x-projection of z.
- NE: If part of x extends to the east of z.
- NW: If part of x extends to the west of z.

Actually, I misunderstood again. Let's re-analyze:

From x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

Therefore:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

This means the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z.

Combining the vertical constraints:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

Therefore:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

This means that the bottom of x is above the top of z. So, x is above z.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is:
- N: Since x is above z and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z.

Actually, from the derived constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): This means the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This means the bottom of x is above the top of z.

These are precisely the conditions for x N z, which means x is north of z. Hence, the relation between x and z is N.

Actually, I missed something. Let's recompute the constraints more carefully.

From x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

Wait, I derived the combined horizontal constraint incorrectly. Let's correct it:

From x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y N z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

Therefore:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

This means the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z.

Combining the vertical constraints:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z)

Therefore:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means that the bottom of x is above the top of z. So, x is completely above z.

Given these constraints, the relation between x and z is N, since x is completely above z and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z.

Hmm, but actually let's carefully reread the problem and the original constraints again:

If region x is B of region y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means x is contained within the minimum bounding box of y. It's possible that x and y could overlap in regions.

If region y is N of region z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means y is completely north of z, and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.

Let's think about this more visually:

- x is within the bounding box of y. This means x can be anywhere inside the box formed by y's boundaries.
- y is north of z. This means y is completely above z, and the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z.

Given these, what are the possible positions of x relative to z?

Vertically, since y is north of z, y is completely above z. Since x is within the bounding box of y, x can be anywhere inside the box formed by y's boundaries. But since the entire box of y is north of z, x must also be north of z.

Horizontally, since y is north of z, the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z. Since x is within the bounding box of y, the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of y. Therefore, the x-projection of x is also within the x-projection of z.

So, the relation between x and z is N, which means x is north of z.

Actually, let's try once more thinking this through. Looking back at the definitions:

If region x is B of region y, then x is contained within the bounding box of y.
If region y is N of region z, then y is completely north of z, and the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z.

Now, let's analyze from a different angle:

Since x is within the bounding box of y and y is completely north of z, the bottom of x is above the bottom of y, which is above the top of z. This means x is completely above z.

Now, horizontally: Since the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z, and the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of y, the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z.

Given these constraints, the relation between x and z is N, since x is completely above z and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z.

Ah, I see the issue. I misunderstood the original definitions. Let's be more precise:

If x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x): The western boundary of x is east of or at the western boundary of y.
- supx(x) <= supx(y): The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of x is north of or at the southern boundary of y.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): The northern boundary of x is south of or at the northern boundary of y.

This means x is completely contained within the bounding box of y.

If y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y): The northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of y.
- infx(z) <= infx(y): The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of y.
- supx(y) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of y is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.

This means y is completely north of z, and the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z.

Ok, now given these constraints, let's re-derive the relationship between x and z.

Vertical Constraints:
- From x B y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means the northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x, which means x is completely north of z.

Horizontal Constraints:
- From x B y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y N z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means:
- The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of x.
- The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.

But, these horizontal constraints don't mean the x-projection of x is fully contained within the x-projection of z. Consider this scenario:
- infx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2, infx(x) = 3
- supx(x) = 5, supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 4
In this case, x would be partially east of z, which is the NE relation.

On re-reading the question, I remembered something important. The question asks for the possible relations, not the definite relation. So, I need to figure out all possible relations given the constraints.

Vertical Constraints:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is completely north of z.

Horizontal Constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

These horizontal constraints give us different possibilities based on the exact values of infx(z), infx(x), supx(x), and supx(z):

1. If infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) < supx(z), then x and z overlap horizontally, but x is completely north of z. This is the N relation.

2. If infx(z) = infx(x) and supx(x) < supx(z), then the western boundaries of x and z align, but x is completely north of z. This is still the N relation.

3. If infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) = supx(z), then the eastern boundaries of x and z align, but x is completely north of z. This is still the N relation.

4. If infx(z) = infx(x) and supx(x) = supx(z), then the horizontal boundaries of x and z align exactly, but x is completely north of z. This is still the N relation.

5. But there are also more possibilities. The given constraints only state:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
   
   But it doesn't dictate the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). What if infx(x) > supx(z)? This would mean x is completely east of z. Combined with the vertical constraint, this would be the NE relation.

6. Similary, what if supx(x) < infx(z)? This would mean x is completely west of z. Combined with the vertical constraint, this would be the NW relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, and NW.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused by my own reasoning, let me go back to the problem statement and the definitions.

From the original statement, if x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means region x is contained within the minimum bounding box of region y.

If y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means region y is north of region z, and the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z.

Let's re-derive the constraints:

From x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x): The western boundary of x is east of or at the western boundary of y.
- supx(x) <= supx(y): The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of x is north of or at the southern boundary of y.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): The northern boundary of x is south of or at the northern boundary of y.

From y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y): The northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of y.
- infx(z) <= infx(y): The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of y.
- supx(y) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of y is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.

Combining these:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x): The northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x. This means x is completely north of z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of y, which is west of or at the western boundary of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of y, which is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.

From the definitions, for x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x. (We already established this.)
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of x. (We already established this.)
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of z. (We already established this.)

So, based on our derived constraints, the relation between x and z is N.

Actually, wait. I need to re-analyze. The original definitions are:

If x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

Hmm, this really means x is contained in the bounding box of y. Let's visualize it:
- infx(y) <= infx(x): The western boundary of x is east of or at the western boundary of y.
- supx(x) <= supx(y): The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of x is north of or at the southern boundary of y.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): The northern boundary of x is south of or at the northern boundary of y.

So x is inside the box formed by y's boundaries.

If y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Visualizing this:
- supy(z) <= infy(y): The northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of y. This means y is completely north of z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y): The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of y.
- supx(y) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of y is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.

The second and third conditions mean the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.

So, y is completely north of z and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z.

Now, let's derive the constraints on x relative to z:

Vertical Constraints:
- From x B y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means x is completely north of z.

Horizontal Constraints:
- From x B y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y N z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means:
- The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of y, which is west of or at the western boundary of x.
- The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of y, which is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.

Looking at these constraints, x is completely north of z, and its x-projection can be:
- Completely within the x-projection of z.
- Partially overlap with the x-projection of z.
- Be completely outside the x-projection of z.

Actually, point 3 is not possible due to the constraint:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

Together, these imply:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of x.)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.)

So, x's x-projection is within the x-projection of z.

Let's examine the relation definitions:

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is completely north of z. (We've established this.)
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of x. (We've established this.)
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of z. (We've established this.)

So, the relation between x and z is N.

OK, now let's try a different approach. Let's draw the constraints for x B y and y N z, and then see what those constraints allow in terms of relationships between x and z.

If x B y, this means x is inside of y's bounding box:
```
    y's bounding box
    +---------------+
    |               |
    |     xxx       |
    |     xxx       |
    |               |
    +---------------+
```

If y N z, then y is north of z and its x-projection is contained within z's x-projection:
```
       y
    +-------+
    |       |
    +-------+
        z
    +---------+
    |         |
    +---------+
```

Combining these, we get:
```
    y's bounding box
    +---------------+
    |               |
    |     xxx       |
    |     xxx       |
    |               |
    +---------------+
        z
    +---------+
    |         |
    +---------+
```

From this, we can see that x is north of z, and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z. This aligns with the N relation.

Oh actually I mis-drew that. If y N z, it's y that is north of z. So the drawing is more like:

```
        y
    +---------+
    |         |
    +---------+
        z
    +-----------+
    |           |
    +-----------+
```

And if x B y, then x is inside the bounding box of y:

```
        y
    +---------+
    |   xxx   |
    |   xxx   |
    +---------+
        z
    +-----------+
    |           |
    +-----------+
```

From this, we can see that x is north of z, and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z. This aligns with the N relation.

But I now realize that the question might be asking about the possible spatial relations that could exist between x and z. It might be useful to see if there are other possible relations between x and z given the constraints.

If x B y, the constraints are:
- infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

If y N z, the constraints are:
- supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's see if it's possible to have the following relation between x and z:

1. N (North): 
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): From our earlier derivation, we know this holds.
   - infx(z) <= infx(x): From our derivation, we know this holds.
   - supx(x) <= supx(z): From our derivation, we know this holds.
   
   So, the relation x N z is possible.

2. NE (North East):
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): From our earlier derivation, we know this holds.
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): This condition means the eastern boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of x.
   
   But from our derived constraints, we have supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (since supx(x) must be greater than or equal to infx(x)).
   
   So, the relation x NE z is not possible.

3. E (East):
   - infy(z) <= infy(x): This condition means the southern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x.
   - supy(x) <= supy(z): This condition means the northern boundary of x is south of or at the northern boundary of z.
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): This condition means the eastern boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of x.
   
   From our derived constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for the E relation.
   
   So, the relation x E z is not possible.

4. SE (South East):
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): This condition means the northern boundary of x is south of or at the southern boundary of z.
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): This condition means the eastern boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of x.
   
   From our derived constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means the northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x. This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for the SE relation.
   
   So, the relation x SE z is not possible.

5. S (South):
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): This condition means the northern boundary of x is south of or at the southern boundary of z.
   - infx(z) <= infx(x): This condition means the western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of x.
   - supx(x) <= supx(z): This condition means the eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.
   
   From our derived constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means the northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x. This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for the S relation.
   
   So, the relation x S z is not possible.

6. SW (South West):
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): This condition means the northern boundary of x is south of or at the southern boundary of z.
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): This condition means the eastern boundary of x is west of or at the western boundary of z.
   
   From our derived constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means the northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x. This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for the SW relation.
   
   So, the relation x SW z is not possible.

7. W (West):
   - infy(z) <= infy(x): This condition means the southern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x.
   - supy(x) <= supy(z): This condition means the northern boundary of x is south of or at the northern boundary of z.
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): This condition means the eastern boundary of x is west of or at the western boundary of z.
   
   From our derived constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for the W relation.
   
   So, the relation x W z is not possible.

8. NW (North West):
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): From our earlier derivation, we know this holds.
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): This condition means the eastern boundary of x is west of or at the western boundary of z.
   
   This conflicts with our derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means the western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of x. This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for the NW relation.
   
   So, the relation x NW z is not possible.

9. B (Bounding Box):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x): From our derivation, we know this holds.
   - supx(x) <= supx(z): From our derivation, we know this holds.
   - infy(z) <= infy(x): This condition means the southern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x.
   - supy(x) <= supy(z): This condition means the northern boundary of x is south of or at the northern boundary of z.
   
   From our derived constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for the B relation.
   
   So, the relation x B z is not possible.

After this detailed analysis, the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints is N, which means x is north of z.

Hmm, let me actually double-check the definition of relation B (bounding box). From the provided description:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means region a is within the bounding box of region b.

For x B y, the conditions are:
- infx(y) <= infx(x): The western boundary of y is west of or at the western boundary of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(y): The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of y is south of or at the southern boundary of x.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): The northern boundary of x is south of or at the northern boundary of y.

These constraints mean the region x is completely inside the bounding box of region y. It might not completely fill the bounding box, but is constrained by the box's boundaries.

Similarly, for y N z, the conditions are:
- supy(z) <= infy(y): The northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of y.
- infx(z) <= infx(y): The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of y.
- supx(y) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of y is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.

Actually this might not be the clearest way to express relation B (bounding box). Let me try once more. For x B y, the constraints are:
- infx(y) <= infx(x): The western boundary of x is east of or at the western boundary of y.
- supx(x) <= supx(y): The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of x is north of or at the southern boundary of y.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): The northern boundary of x is south of or at the northern boundary of y.

So again for x B y, x is inside the box formed by y's boundaries.

For y N z, the constraints are:
- supy(z) <= infy(y): The northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of y. This means y is completely north of z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y): The western boundary of y is east of or at the western boundary of z.
- supx(y) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of y is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.

This means y is completely north of z, and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.

I really want to be careful now, and derive the constraints on x relative to z step by step.

1. Vertical Constraints:
   - From x B y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
   - From y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y)
   
   Combining these:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
   
   This means the northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x. So, x is completely north of z.

2. Horizontal Constraints:
   - From x B y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - From y N z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
   
   Combining these:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
   
   This means:
   - The western boundary of x is east of or at the western boundary of y, which is east of or at the western boundary of z.
   - The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of y, which is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.
   
   So, x's x-projection is within the x-projection of z.

From the definition, for x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is completely north of z. (We've established this.)
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The western boundary of x is east of or at the western boundary of z. (We've established this.)
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of z. (We've established this.)

So, the relation between x and z is N, which means x is north of z.

Actually that doesn't seem right to me. Given that horizontally, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), the western boundary of x is east of or at the western boundary of z and the eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of z. Intuitively, that means that x is squeezed into the horizontal space of z. So x is strictly contained inside of z horizontally, which means x's x-projection is within the x-projection of z. Thus horizontally, x B z holds, not x N z. x N z just means that vertically, x is north of z.


Hmm, it might be better to use the definitions to guide us. 

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of x.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.

We've derived:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

So, the relation x N z is indeed possible.

Actually, let me try to visualize the constraints again to make sure I'm not missing anything.

If x B y, this means:
```
   y's bounding box
   +-------------+
   |             |
   |   +-----+   |
   |   |  x  |   |
   |   +-----+   |
   |             |
   +-------------+
```

If y N z, this means:
```
      y
   +-----+
   |     |
   +-----+

      z
   +-------+
   |       |
   +-------+
```

Combining these, we get:
```
   y's bounding box
   +-------------+
   |             |
   |   +-----+   |
   |   |  x  |   |
   |   +-----+   |
   |             |
   +-------------+

      z
   +-------+
   |       |
   +-------+
```

From this visualization, we can see that x is completely north of z, and its x-projection is within the x-projection of z. This aligns with the N relation.

I think the conclusion is correct: the relation between x and z is N, which means x is north of z.

OK actually let me be super-specific and plot the constraint on each of the critical variables.

1. From x B y, the constraints on boundaries are:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. From y N z, the constraints on boundaries are:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z)

Derived from those:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z)

Now, I'll check for each of the possible cardinal direction relations:

For x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (We've established this.)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) ✓ (We've established this.)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) ✓ (We've established this.)
So, the relation x N z is possible.

For x NE z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (We've established this.)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) ✗ (Contradicts our established supx(x) <= supx(z).)
So, the relation x NE z is not possible.

For x E z:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) ✗ (Contradicts our established supy(z) <= infy(x), since supy(z) > infy(z).)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) ✗ (Not necessarily true from our established constraints.)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) ✗ (Contradicts our established supx(x) <= supx(z).)
So, the relation x E z is not possible.

For x SE z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) ✗ (Contradicts our established supy(z) <= infy(x), since infy(z) < supy(z).)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) ✗ (Contradicts our established supx(x) <= supx(z).)
So, the relation x SE z is not possible.

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) ✗ (Contradicts our established supy(z) <= infy(x), since infy(z) < supy(z).)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) ✓ (We've established this.)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) ✓ (We've established this.)
So, the relation x S z is not possible.

For x SW z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) ✗ (Contradicts our established supy(z) <= infy(x), since infy(z) < supy(z).)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) ✗ (Contradicts our established infx(z) <= infx(x), since infx(x) <= supx(x).)
So, the relation x SW z is not possible.

For x W z:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) ✗ (Contradicts our established supy(z) <= infy(x), since infy(z) < supy(z).)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) ✗ (Not necessarily true from our established constraints.)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) ✗ (Contradicts our established infx(z) <= infx(x), since infx(x) <= supx(x).)
So, the relation x W z is not possible.

For x NW z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (We've established this.)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) ✗ (Contradicts our established infx(z) <= infx(x), since infx(x) <= supx(x).)
So, the relation x NW z is not possible.

For x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) ✓ (We've established this.)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) ✓ (We've established this.)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) ✗ (Contradicts our established supy(z) <= infy(x), since infy(z) < supy(z).)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) ✗ (Not necessarily true from our established constraints.)
So, the relation x B z is not possible.

After this thorough analysis, the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints is N, which means x is north of z.

Actually, there's something I'm doubtful about. My reasoning for "x NW z is not possible" was that infx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(x) means infx(z) <= supx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for the NW relation.

But the reason I'm worried is that infx(z) <= infx(x) was derived from infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). But do we really know that infx(y) <= infx(x)? From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

But it's not necessarily the case that infx(z) <= infx(y). While we know that infx(z) <= infx(y) from y N z, we don't know the relations between these variables and infx(x). It's possible that infx(x) < infx(z), which would mean x is to the west of z, i.e., x NW z.

Actually I'm being sloppy. The definition of y N z includes infx(z) <= infx(y), so it is indeed the case that infx(z) <= infx(y). And the definition of x B y includes infx(y) <= infx(x), so it is indeed the case that infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). So we do know that infx(z) <= infx(x). And as I showed, the condition for x NW z requires supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) && infx(x) <= supx(x) (which means that infx(z) <= supx(x).

OK let me think through this one more time:

We have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): This means the western boundary of z is west of or at the western boundary of y, which is west of or at the western boundary of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z): This means the eastern boundary of x is west of or at the eastern boundary of y, which is west of or at the eastern boundary of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x): This means the northern boundary of z is south of or at the southern boundary of y, which is south of or at the southern boundary of x.

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓
- infx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
- supx(x) <= supx(z) ✓

From the constraints we've derived, the relation x N z is indeed valid.

OK, so we know that the relation between x and z is N, which means x is north of z.

After a careful analysis, the relation between region x and region z is N, which means region x is north of region z.

But I think what the question is asking is "what could possibly be the relation?", not "what is the relation?". Let me re-review the constraints to see if there are actually multiple possible relations between x and z.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y N z, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

But we also know that these are just inequalities, and the actual values could be anything that satisfies these constraints. it's possible that the constraint is strictly less than, or equal to. Considering the possible values, we get:
- supy(z) < infy(y) < infy(x)
- infx(z) < infx(y) < infx(x)
- supx(x) < supx(y) < supx(z)
or
- supy(z) = infy(y) < infy(x)
- infx(z) = infx(y) < infx(x)
- supx(x) = supx(y) < supx(z)
or
- supy(z) < infy(y) = infy(x)
- infx(z) < infx(y) = infx(x)
- supx(x) < supx(y) = supx(z)
or
- supy(z) = infy(y) = infy(x)
- infx(z) = infx(y) = infx(x)
- supx(x) = supx(y) = supx(z)

In all these cases, the relation between x and z remains N.

I'm now confident that the only possible relation between x and z, given the constraints, is N.

ANSWER:

The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z, given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is N of region z

I'll analyze the constraints step by step:

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [western boundary of x is east of or at western boundary of y]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) [eastern boundary of x is west of or at eastern boundary of y]
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) [southern boundary of x is north of or at southern boundary of y]
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) [northern boundary of x is south of or at northern boundary of y]

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) [northern boundary of z is south of or at southern boundary of y]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) [western boundary of z is west of or at western boundary of y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [eastern boundary of y is west of or at eastern boundary of z]

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) [x must be completely north of z]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [western boundary relationships]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [eastern boundary relationships]

These constraints exactly match the definition of the N relation:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✓

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.
