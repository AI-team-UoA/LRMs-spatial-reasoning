PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what we know:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is E of region z

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of the cardinal directions:
- N (North): x N y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- E (East): x E y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

Given that x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

And given that y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z.

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y E z, we have:
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

These don't directly give us a constraint on the relative y-coordinates of x and z. Let's continue.

From x N y, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y E z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)

Combining supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

This is one of the conditions for x being NE, E, or SE of z. 

Now, let's consider the y-coordinates.

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y E z, we have:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we can't derive a direct constraint between infy(x) and supy(z). 

However, given the conditions we have, and considering the definitions of cardinal directions, let's check which directions x could be in relation to z.

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) for x to be strictly N of z. So, x can't be directly N of z.

For x to be NE of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

We have supx(z) <= infx(x) from our deductions. The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible but not guaranteed from our given constraints. So, x can potentially be NE of z.

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We have supx(z) <= infx(x) from our deductions. The conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are possible but not guaranteed. So, x can potentially be E of z.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We have supx(z) <= infx(x) from our deductions. The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible but not guaranteed. So, x can potentially be SE of z.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) for x to be strictly S of z. So, x can't be directly S of z.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x can't be SW of z.

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x can't be W of z.

For x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x can't be NW of z.

For x to be B (bounding box) of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x can't be B of z.

Actually, I need to revisit my analysis. I'm not correctly using the constraints given.

Given x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is contained horizontally within y)

Given y E z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is contained vertically within z)

Now, let's derive what we can about the relationship between x and z:

From supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we get:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
Which implies infy(z) <= infy(x) or, equivalently, infy(z) <= infy(x).

From supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
Which implies supx(z) <= infx(x).

These constraints, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x), are consistent with x being in one of the E, NE, or SE directions from z.

But we need to further narrow down based on the other constraints.

Given that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we know infy(z) <= infy(x). However, from supy(y) <= supy(z), we can't directly infer the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and supy(z).

From supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), we know supx(z) <= infx(x). From this, x can't be directly to the W, SW, or NW of z.

Given that infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), we know the horizontal span of x is contained within the horizontal span of y. From supx(z) <= infx(y), we know z is entirely to the left of y. This means z is also entirely to the left of x, i.e., supx(z) <= infx(x).

Let's now check each possible direction:

1. x NE z: 
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) ?

   We know infy(z) <= infy(x). Can we determine the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x)? From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we can't directly infer the relationship. It's possible for x to be NE of z.

2. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) ✓
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) ?

   We know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we can't directly infer the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z). It's possible for x to be E of z.

3. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) ?

   This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), but we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x). For x to be SE of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z), but we have infy(z) <= infy(x) (x starts above where z starts). Given that regions are connected, this seems contradictory. So, I don't think x can be SE of z. However, it depends on the relative heights of the regions, so I'll reserve judgment for now.

Let's approach this more systematically.

Given:
- x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y)

We know:
- x is strictly above y.
- y is strictly to the right of z.

Since x is strictly above y and y is strictly to the right of z, x is somewhere in the upper-right quadrant from z's perspective. This suggests that x could be in the N, NE, or E directions from z.

Let's reason this out more intuitively:

Put z at the center of the coordinate system. Given y E z, y is to the right of z. Given x N y, x is above y.

If y is immediately to the right of z, and x is immediately above y, then x is in the NE direction from z.

If y extends quite far to the right of z, and x is above y but also extends to the left, then x could be in the N direction from z.

If y extends quite far to the right of z, and x is above y but also extends to the right, then x could be in the NE direction from z.

If y is to the right of z, but also extends upwards, and x is above y and also extends to the right, then x could be in the E direction from z.

Let's check each of the nine possible directions:

1. x N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We know supy(y) <= infy(x). Since y is contained vertically within z, it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x) as well. But we also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Now, from supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z) for x to be N of z. So, x can't be directly N of z.

2. x NE z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)

   Again, since y is contained vertically within z, it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x). Given supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), we have supx(z) <= infx(x). Both conditions for x to be NE of z can be satisfied, so x can be NE of z.

3. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We know supx(z) <= infx(x) from our deductions. From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we don't immediately get infy(z) <= infy(x), but since regions are connected and infy(z) <= infy(y), it's plausible that infy(z) <= infy(x). The third condition, supy(x) <= supy(z), can also be satisfied given the flexibility in how we define the regions. So, x can be E of z.

4. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   We know supx(z) <= infx(x) from our deductions. But given that supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is contained vertically within z), we can infer infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This means infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be SE of z (since a region can't have its top below its bottom). So, x can't be SE of z.

5. x S z:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   Given the reasoning from x SE z, we know infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be S of z. So, x can't be S of z.

6. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   Given supx(z) <= infx(x) and the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x to be SW of z, we have a contradiction: supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). This is impossible. So, x can't be SW of z.

7. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   Similar to the reasoning for x SW z, the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts our deduction supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x can't be W of z.

8. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   Again, the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts our deduction supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x can't be NW of z.

9. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) contradicts our deduction supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x can't be B of z.

Wait, I think I'm still confusing myself. Let me reason through this step by step.

First, let's understand what "x N y" means:
- x is strictly above y.
- x's horizontal extent is within y's horizontal extent.

Second, what "y E z" means:
- y is strictly to the right of z.
- y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent.

Given these, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

x is strictly above y, and y is vertically contained within z. This means x must be at least partially above z.

y is strictly to the right of z, and x's horizontal extent is within y's horizontal extent. This means x must be at least partially to the right of z.

Let's consider the different possible positions:

1. x NE z: x is both above and to the right of z. 
   Given that x is strictly above y and y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent, x can be to the northeast of z.

2. x N z: x is directly above z (horizontally aligned).
   For this to be true, x and z would need to overlap horizontally. But y is to the right of z and x is horizontally contained within y, so x must also be to the right of z. This means x can't be directly north of z.

3. x E z: x is to the right of z (vertically aligned).
   Given that y is to the right of z and x is horizontally contained within y, x is to the right of z. But x is also strictly above y, and y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent. If y's vertical extent matches z's vertical extent, then x would be to the northeast of z. If y's vertical extent is strictly within z's vertical extent, then x could be directly to the east of z.

Let me think more about case 3, where x is directly E of z:

For x to be directly E of z, x's vertical extent should be within z's vertical extent. Given that x is N of y, x's bottom is above y's top. Given that y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent, y's top is below z's top. Combining these, x's bottom is above y's top, which is below z's top. This doesn't tell us directly if x's top is below z's top.

Let's think about this visually. We know the following:
- z is to the left.
- y is to the right of z and vertically contained within z.
- x is above y and horizontally contained within y.

If y and z are of the same height and their bottoms are aligned, and x is just above y and of the same width as y, then x would be NE of z.

If z is much taller than y, such that z's top is above x's top, and if y is at the top part of z, then x would be E of z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z depend on the relative sizes and positions of the regions.

Let's check the formal definitions again:

For x to be NE of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x. This is possible given that y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent and x is above y.
- supx(z) <= infx(x): The right of z is to the left of the left of x. This is true given that y is to the right of z and x's horizontal extent is within y's.

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): The right of z is to the left of the left of x. This is true given that y is to the right of z and x's horizontal extent is within y's.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): The bottom of z is below the bottom of x. This is possible if z extends below y.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): The top of x is below the top of z. This is possible if z extends above x.

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x. This is possible given that y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent and x is above y.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The left of z is to the left of the left of x. This is true given that y is to the right of z and x's horizontal extent is within y's.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The right of x is to the left of the right of z. This seems contradictory given our constraints. Given that y is to the right of z and x's horizontal extent is within y's, x is to the right of z. This means supx(x) > supx(z), which contradicts the requirement for x to be N of z.

Ok so we can't have N.

For x to be B of z, the horizontal and vertical extents of x should be within the horizontal and vertical extents of z, which is not the case given our constraints. x is to the right of z and above y, which places it outside the bounds of z.

Given the constraints, it seems that the possible relations between x and z are NE and E. But let's explicitly check each of the nine possible relations to be sure.

For x to be NE of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

Given:
- x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y)

Since y E z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). Since x N y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x).

Combining these, we get supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). From this, we can deduce supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)). This doesn't immediately tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x), so we can't say for sure if supy(z) <= infy(x) or not.

But given that y is between x and z, and y is E of z, horizontally x is also to the right of z. Since x is N of y, x is above y. So, x is to the right and above z, making NE a possible relation.

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given:
- x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y)

Similar to the reasoning above, x is to the right of z, so the first condition holds. We know infy(z) <= infy(y) (since y E z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (since x N y). This gives us infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x), satisfying the second condition. The third condition, supy(x) <= supy(z), is not immediately derivable from our constraints. But given the framework, where regions can be of varying sizes, it's possible for z to be tall enough that supy(x) <= supy(z). So, E is a possible relation too.

Let me see if I'm missing anything or if another relation is possible. Let's check each relation one by one.

1. N (North): For x to be N of z, x must be directly above z (horizontally aligned). But since y is to the right of z and x is horizontally contained within y, x is also to the right of z. This means x can't be directly north of z. So, N is not a possible relation.

2. NE (North East): As discussed, x is to the right and above z, making NE a possible relation.

3. E (East): As discussed, E is a possible relation too, provided that z is tall enough.

4. SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, x must be to the right and below z. But we know x is above y (since x N y) and y is vertically contained within z (since y E z). This means x is above at least part of z, so x can't be entirely below z. So, SE is not a possible relation.

5. S (South): For x to be S of z, x must be directly below z (horizontally aligned). But, similar to the reasoning for SE, x can't be entirely below z. Plus, since y is to the right of z and x is horizontally contained within y, x is also to the right of z. This means x can't be directly south of z. So, S is not a possible relation.

6. SW (South West): For x to be SW of z, x must be to the left and below z. But since y is to the right of z and x is horizontally contained within y, x is also to the right of z. This means x can't be to the left of z. So, SW is not a possible relation.

7. W (West): For x to be W of z, x must be directly to the left of z (vertically aligned). But, as mentioned, x is to the right of z, so W is not a possible relation.

8. NW (North West): For x to be NW of z, x must be to the left and above z. But since x is to the right of z, NW is not a possible relation.

9. B (Bounding Box): For x to be B of z, x must be horizontally and vertically contained within z. But since x is to the right of z (based on our deductions), x can't be horizontally contained within z. So, B is not a possible relation.

Given the constraints, the only possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

But actually, let me double check NE and E again to make sure.

For x to be NE of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

For E, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our given constraints, we've established:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (since x's horizontal extent is within y's and y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (since y is vertically contained within z, and x is above y)

The first bullet point confirms supx(z) <= infx(x), which is required for both NE and E.
The second bullet point confirms infy(z) <= infy(x), which is required for E.

But to determine if x can be NE of z, we need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x).

Given that y is vertically contained within z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). We also know that x is above y, so supy(y) <= infy(x). This gives us supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)). But we can't directly infer from this if supy(z) <= infy(x).

Here's a revised analysis: Since the regions have flexibility in their shapes and sizes, both NE and E are possible relations between x and z.

For NE, we need z to be such that its top is below the bottom of x, which is possible given our constraints.
For E, we need z to extend vertically such that its bottom is below the bottom of x and its top is above the top of x, which is also possible.

Reflecting on the given constraints, it's becoming clear that NE and E are indeed the only possible relations between x and z. N, S, SW, W, NW, and B are ruled out because x is to the right of z. SE is ruled out because x is above y, which is vertically contained within z, placing x above at least part of z.

Actually, since I'm a bit confused about NE, let me double-check NE one more time.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x.
- supx(z) <= infx(x): The right of z is to the left of the left of x.

From the given constraints, we know:
- x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), and x's horizontal extent is within y's.
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), and y's vertical extent is within z's.

This gives us:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (the right of z is to the left of the left of y, and y's horizontal extent is within y's)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) (y's vertical extent is within z's)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's vertical extent is within z's)

Combining supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we get supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)). This doesn't tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

But we know that x is above y and y is vertically contained within z. If z's top is aligned with y's top, then x would be above z's top, satisfying the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for NE. If z's top is slightly above y's top, it's still possible for z's top to be below x's bottom. But if z's top is significantly above y's top, then z's top might be above x's bottom, in which case the NE relation doesn't hold.

So NE is a possible relation, but it depends on the specific positions of the regions. Similarly E is possible.

Let me think about this one more time.

x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y)

For x to be NE of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

The second condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), is satisfied because y is to the right of z and x is horizontally contained within y.

For the first condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), we know supy(y) <= infy(x) from "x N y". From "y E z", we know y is vertically contained within z, so infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means the top of y (supy(y)) can be below the top of z (supy(z)). Since x is above y, the bottom of x (infy(x)) is above the top of y (supy(y)). If the top of z (supy(z)) is only slightly above the top of y (supy(y)), then it's possible for the top of z to still be below the bottom of x, which would satisfy the condition for x to be NE of z. But if the top of z is significantly above the top of y, then the top of z may be above the bottom of x, and x would be E of z rather than NE.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NE and E, depending on the precise positions of the regions.

Wait, I think I just realized what's been confusing me, and another possible direction came to mind. Let me think about N again.

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The left of x is to the right of the left of z.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The right of x is to the left of the right of z.

We've established that the first condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), can be satisfied (under certain configurations).

The second condition, infx(z) <= infx(x), can be satisfied given that y is to the right of z, and x's horizontal extent is within y's. The right of z is to the left of the left of y, which means the left of z is also to the left of the left of y. Given that the left of x is to the right of the left of y, the left of z is to the left of the left of x.

So we've established that z's left is to the left of x's left, which means infx(z) <= infx(x).

The third condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), requires the right of x to be to the left of the right of z. This is trickier.

Ah, I can see the issue now. The statement supx(z) <= infx(y) means the right of z is to the left of the left of y. Similarly, from "y E z", we know y is to the right of z, which means the right of z is to the left of the left of y. Given that x's horizontal extent is within y's, the right of x is to the left of the right of y and the left of x is to the right of the left of y. We know the right of z is to the left of the left of y, which is to the left of the right of y, which can be to the left of the right of x. In other words, we're not guaranteed that the right of z is to the right of the right of x.

Let's actually try to think about this a bit differently, using a more visual approach.

Given:
- "x N y": x is above y, and the horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of y.
- "y E z": y is to the right of z, and the vertical extent of y is contained within the vertical extent of z.

Visually, this means:
- x is above y, which is to the right of z.
- y is vertically contained within z, so z might be taller than y.
- x is horizontally contained within y, so x is also to the right of z.

But what are the exact possibilities for how x relates to z?

1. N (North): For x to be N of z, x must be directly above z (horizontally aligned). This requires the horizontal extent of x to be within the horizontal extent of z. Given that x is horizontally contained within y and y is to the right of z, it would seem that x can't be N of z. However, if the horizontal extent of z is much wider than that of y, such that it encompasses the horizontal extent of x, then x can be N of z. In other words, if z stretches far enough to the right to overlap with x horizontally, N becomes a possible relation.

Ah, I think I see the issue in my earlier reasoning. I had implicitly assumed that the right of z is to the left of the left of x, but this isn't necessarily true. Given that y is to the right of z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y). But the horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of y, which means infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). This doesn't tell us directly how supx(z) relates to infx(x) or how supx(x) relates to supx(z). So, N can be a possible relation.

In fact, let's reconsider all relations anew:

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The left of z is to the left of the left of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The right of x is to the left of the right of z.

From the constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). Given x N y, supy(y) <= infy(x). Combining these, we can get supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)). If infy(x) <= supy(z), then the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be N of z isn't satisfied. But if supy(z) <= infy(x), then the first condition for N is met.

From y E z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y). Given x N y, infx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us supx(z) <= infx(x).

From this, we can't derive a direct relationship between infx(z) and infx(x) or between supx(x) and supx(z). So, the conditions for N aren't contradicted, making N a possible relation.

So actually, N is a possibility based on my updated analysis. Our answer is N, NE, and E.

I need to be more rigorous about each of these constraints. Let me work through each of the conditions for the relation "N" and check if they are compatible with the given constraints.

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The left of z is to the left of the left of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The right of x is to the left of the right of z.

Given constraints:
- x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). This means x is strictly above y, and the horizontal extent of x is within the horizontal extent of y.
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means y is strictly to the right of z, and the vertical extent of y is within the vertical extent of z.

Let's check each condition for "x N z" to see if it's compatible with the given constraints:

For supy(z) <= infy(x), we know from "x N y" that supy(y) <= infy(x). From "y E z", we have supy(y) <= supy(z). This means supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)). This doesn't directly tell us if supy(z) <= infy(x), so this condition could be satisfied, but it's not guaranteed.

For infx(z) <= infx(x), we don't have a direct constraint. From "x N y", we have infx(y) <= infx(x), and from "y E z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y). These don't give us a direct relationship between infx(z) and infx(x), so this condition could be satisfied.

For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have a direct constraint. From "x N y", we have supx(x) <= supx(y), but we don't have a direct relationship between supx(y) and supx(z). So, this condition could also be satisfied.

Given the flexibility of the constraints, it appears that "x N z" is a possible relation.

Now, let's do the same for "x NE z":

For x to be NE of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x.
- supx(z) <= infx(x): The right of z is to the left of the left of x.

The first condition is the same as for "x N z", and we've established that it can be satisfied.

For supx(z) <= infx(x), we know from "y E z" that supx(z) <= infx(y), and from "x N y" that infx(y) <= infx(x). This gives us supx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies the condition.

So, "x NE z" is a possible relation.

And for "x E z":

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): The right of z is to the left of the left of x.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): The bottom of z is below the bottom of x.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): The top of x is below the top of z.

We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies the first condition.

For infy(z) <= infy(x), from "y E z" we know infy(z) <= infy(y). From "x N y" we have supy(y) <= infy(x). We can't directly derive a relationship between infy(y) and infy(x) from the given constraints. However, given that the regions are connected, it's plausible that infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.

For supy(x) <= supy(z), we don't have a direct constraint. From "y E z", we know supy(y) <= supy(z), but we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(y). So, this condition could be satisfied.

Given the flexibility of the constraints, it appears that "x E z" is also a possible relation.

Now, let's check the remaining relations to ensure they're all exhaustive.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): The right of z is to the left of the left of x.
- supy(x) <= infy(z): The top of x is below the bottom of z.

We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies the first condition.

For supy(x) <= infy(z), from "x N y" we know supy(y) <= infy(x). From "y E z" we have infy(z) <= infy(y). Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This doesn't directly give us a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). However, given that x is above y and y is vertically contained within z, it's unlikely for x to be below z. So, the second condition is unlikely to be satisfied, making "x SE z" an unlikely relation. However, given the flexibility of the constraints, I can't definitively rule it out.

Actually, to satisfy the second condition supy(x) <= infy(z), we would have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). But we can't have supy(x) <= infy(x) (the top of a region can't be below its bottom), so this is a contradiction. Therefore, "x SE z" is not a possible relation.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z): The top of x is below the bottom of z.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The left of z is to the left of the left of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The right of x is to the left of the right of z.

Given the contradiction identified for "x SE z", the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) can't be satisfied. Therefore, "x S z" is not a possible relation.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): The right of x is to the left of the left of z.
- supy(x) <= infy(z): The top of x is below the bottom of z.

The second condition is the same as for "x S z" and "x SE z", and we've established that it can't be satisfied. Therefore, "x SW z" is not a possible relation.

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): The right of x is to the left of the left of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): The bottom of z is below the bottom of x.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): The top of x is below the top of z.

From "y E z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y). From "x N y", infx(y) <= infx(x). This gives us supx(z) <= infx(x). Given this, it's unlikely that supx(x) <= infx(z) (this would require x to be entirely to the left of z, which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) if regions are connected). So, the first condition is unlikely to be satisfied, making "x W z" an unlikely relation.

For x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): The right of x is to the left of the left of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x.

Given the reasoning for "x W z", the first condition is unlikely to be satisfied. Therefore, "x NW z" is an unlikely relation.

For x to be B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The left of z is to the left of the left of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The right of x is to the left of the right of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): The bottom of z is below the bottom of x.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): The top of x is below the top of z.

From "y E z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y). From "x N y", infx(y) <= infx(x). This gives us supx(z) <= infx(x). For x to be B of z, we need supx(x) <= supx(z). But this would require infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction. Therefore, "x B z" is not a possible relation.

After exhaustive analysis, it seems that the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and E.

Actually, I think I made a logical error when examining W, SW, and NW. Let me redo those.

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): The right of x is to the left of the left of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): The bottom of z is below the bottom of x.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): The top of x is below the top of z.

From "y E z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y). From "x N y", infx(y) <= infx(x). Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).

For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). This means supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). But this leads to supx(x) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction (the right of a region can't be to the left of its left). So, "x W z" can't be a possible relation.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): The right of x is to the left of the left of z.
- supy(x) <= infy(z): The top of x is below the bottom of z.

Given the contradiction identified for "x W z", the first condition can't be satisfied. Therefore, "x SW z" is not a possible relation.

For x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): The right of x is to the left of the left of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x.

Again, the first condition is the same as for "x W z", and we've established that it can't be satisfied. Therefore, "x NW z" is not a possible relation.

After this comprehensive analysis, it's clear that the only possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and E.

Hmm, hold on, let me think about "x N z" again, because my analysis there seems flawed.

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The left of z is to the left of the left of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The right of x is to the left of the right of z.

From "y E z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y). From "x N y", infx(y) <= infx(x). Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).

For x to be N of z, we need supx(x) <= supx(z). But this, combined with the deduction supx(z) <= infx(x), would lead to supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which is a circular requirement. The only way this is consistent is if supx(x) = supx(z) = infx(x), which is a degenerate case where x is a single vertical line. Given the requirement that the regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, this is not possible.

So, "x N z" is not a possible relation.

Hmm, but let's think through this different. For N we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of x.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): The left of z is to the left of the left of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): The right of x is to the left of the right of z.

From "y E z", we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y): The right of z is to the left of the left of y.
- infy(z) <= infy(y): The bottom of z is below the bottom of y.
- supy(y) <= supy(z): The top of y is below the top of z.

From "x N y", we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x): The top of y is below the bottom of x.
- infx(y) <= infx(x): The left of y is to the left of the left of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(y): The right of x is to the left of the right of y.

For x to be N of z, we need supx(x) <= supx(z). We have supx(x) <= supx(y), but we don't have a direct relationship between supx(y) and supx(z).

We also know supx(z) <= infx(y), which tells us that the right of z is to the left of the left of y. Since the left of y is to the left of the right of y, this implies that the right of z is to the left of the right of y.

Now, we have: 
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right of x is to the left of the right of y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) (the right of z is to the left of the right of y)

This doesn't directly tell us if supx(x) <= supx(z) or supx(z) <= supx(x). So, the condition for x to be N of z isn't contradicted, and N is still a possible relation.

Actually, no, I've been reasoning about this incorrectly. From "y E z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y), which means the right of z is to the left of the left of y. From "x N y", we have infx(y) <= infx(x), which means the left of y is to the left of the left of x.

Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means the right of z is to the left of the left of x.

For x to be N of z, we need supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right of x is to the left of the right of z). But we've just derived supx(z) <= infx(x), and since infx(x) is the left of x and supx(x) is the right of x, we have infx(x) < supx(x) (assuming the region is not degenerate). This gives us supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z) for x to be N of z.

Therefore, "x N z" is not a possible relation after all.

After this thorough analysis, the only possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

Let me double check my answer. In the context of the given constraints, "x N y" and "y E z", the only possible relations between x and z are NE and E. N is ruled out because the horizontal constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) for N is contradicted. SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B are also ruled out for similar constraint inconsistencies. Actually, since the regions in REG are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries, and given the flexibility of the constraints, NE and E are plausible.

So the answer is NE, E.

Actually, I might have made a mistake again. let me re-analyze the situation. 
Given:
- x N y: x is strictly above y, and the horizontal extent of x is within the horizontal extent of y.
- y E z: y is strictly to the right of z, and the vertical extent of y is within the vertical extent of z.

Let's also revisit the cardinal direction definitions:
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(z) <= infx(x)
- E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
- SE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
- SW: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
- W: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
- NW: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
- B: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, let's see if we can derive some constraints about the relationship between x and z.

From "x N y", we can derive:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From "y E z", we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these constraints, we can derive:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).
- supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x). This gives us supx(z) <= infx(x).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This gives us infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).

Given these derived constraints, let's check each cardinal direction relation to see if it's possible:

For x to be N of z:
- Condition 1: supy(z) <= infy(x). This might be satisfied, but we can't tell for sure from the derived constraints.
- Condition 2: infx(z) <= infx(x). This might be satisfied, but we can't tell for sure.
- Condition 3: supx(x) <= supx(z). We know supx(x) <= supx(y), but we don't have a direct relationship between supx(y) and supx(z).

However, we also derived supx(z) <= infx(x). If x is not degenerate, then infx(x) < supx(x), which gives us supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for x to be N of z. Therefore, "x N z" is ruled out.

For x to be NE of z:
- Condition 1: supy(z) <= infy(x). This might be satisfied, but we can't tell for sure.
- Condition 2: supx(z) <= infx(x). This is satisfied as per our derived constraints.

Therefore, "x NE z" is a possible relation.

For x to be E of z:
- Condition 1: supx(z) <= infx(x). This is satisfied as per our derived constraints.
- Condition 2: infy(z) <= infy(x). This is also satisfied as per our derived constraints.
- Condition 3: supy(x) <= supy(z). This might be satisfied, but we can't tell for sure.

Therefore, "x E z" is a possible relation.

For x to be SE of z:
- Condition 1: supx(z) <= infx(x). This is satisfied as per our derived constraints.
- Condition 2: supy(x) <= infy(z). We derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the bottom of z is below the bottom of x. For x to be SE of z, the top of x should be below the bottom of z. These two conditions are contradictory unless x is degenerate, which it's not supposed to be. Therefore, "x SE z" is not a possible relation.

For x to be S of z:
- Condition 1: supy(x) <= infy(z). As reasoned above, this is not possible given the derived constraints.
Therefore, "x S z" is not a possible relation.

For x to be SW of z:
- Condition 1: supx(x) <= infx(z). We derived supx(z) <= infx(x). If both x and z are not degenerate, then infx(z) < supx(z) and infx(x) < supx(x). This gives us supx(x) > infx(x) > supx(z) > infx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x to be SW of z. Therefore, "x SW z" is not a possible relation.

For x to be W of z:
- Condition 1: supx(x) <= infx(z). As reasoned above, this is not possible given the derived constraints.
Therefore, "x W z" is not a possible relation.

For x to be NW of z:
- Condition 1: supx(x) <= infx(z). As reasoned above, this is not possible given the derived constraints.
Therefore, "x NW z" is not a possible relation.

For x to be B of z:
- Condition 1: infx(z) <= infx(x). This might be satisfied, but we can't tell for sure.
- Condition 2: supx(x) <= supx(z). As reasoned for the N direction, this is not possible given the derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x).
Therefore, "x B z" is not a possible relation.

After this thorough analysis, the only possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

Alright, in the question, the possible relations between x and z are NE and E. I've ruled out N, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B, because they contradict the derived constraints.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is E of region z

From the first statement, x is North of y, which means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From the second statement, y is East of z, which means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Analyzing what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. From supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), we can derive:
   supx(z) <= infx(x)
   
2. From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we can derive:
   infy(z) <= infy(x)

Let me check each possible relation:

- For NE: We need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x). The second condition is satisfied, and the first condition can be satisfied depending on the exact positions.

- For E: We need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two conditions are satisfied, and the third can be satisfied depending on the regions' exact heights.

Other directions like N, S, W, SW, SE, NW, and B are not possible because they contradict our derived constraints.

NE, E
