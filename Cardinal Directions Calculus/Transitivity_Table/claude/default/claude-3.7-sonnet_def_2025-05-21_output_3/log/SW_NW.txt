PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

Given information:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

Let me recall the definitions:
- x SW y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y NW z if and only if supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From x SW y:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y NW z:
3. supx(y) <= infx(z)
4. supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, I need to determine what these constraints tell us about the relationship between x and z.

From 1 and 3:
supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This means: supx(x) <= infx(z)

From 2 and 4:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

But I can't directly establish a clear constraint between supy(x) and supy(z) from this.

Let's visualize the constraints:
- x is to the southwest of y (below and to the left)
- y is to the northwest of z (above and to the left)

So x is to the left of y, and y is to the left of z. This means x is definitely to the left of z.
Also, x is below y, and y is above z. 

This gives us several possibilities for the relation between x and z:
1. If x is below z, then x could be SW of z
2. If x is at the same level as z, then x could be W of z
3. If x is above z, then x could be NW of z

Let me double-check this reasoning:

From 1 and 3, we know: supx(x) <= infx(z)
This means x is strictly to the left of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- From 2: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From 4: supy(z) <= infy(y)

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Let's look at the constraints again:
- x SW y means x is to the southwest of y
- y NW z means y is to the northwest of z

Since y is to the northwest of z, y is above z.
Since x is to the southwest of y, x is below y.

This means x could be:
- Below z (SW)
- At the same level as z (W)
- Above z (NW)

Actually, let me be more rigorous. Let's define the bounding boxes of regions x, y, and z using their extremal coordinates:

For region x:
- Left boundary: infx(x)
- Right boundary: supx(x)
- Bottom boundary: infy(x)
- Top boundary: supy(x)

For region y:
- Left boundary: infx(y)
- Right boundary: supx(y)
- Bottom boundary: infy(y)
- Top boundary: supy(y)

For region z:
- Left boundary: infx(z)
- Right boundary: supx(z)
- Bottom boundary: infy(z)
- Top boundary: supy(z)

From x SW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

From the horizontal constraints:
supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This means x is strictly to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)

Now, for the vertical constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SW y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

This doesn't directly give us a constraint between supy(x) and supy(z).

Let's consider all possible relationships between supy(x) and supy(z):

Case 1: supy(x) < infy(z)
This means x is below z. Combined with the horizontal constraint (x is to the left of z), this means x is SW of z.

Case 2: infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
This means x overlaps with z vertically, but doesn't extend above z. Combined with the horizontal constraint, this means x is W of z.

Case 3: infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) and supy(z) < supy(x)
This means x extends above z. Combined with the horizontal constraint, this means x is W of z or x is NW of z. Actually, in more detail, if part of x is at the same level as z and part of x is above z, then the relation would be W:NW. But if all of x is above z (i.e., infy(x) > supy(z)), then the relation would be NW.

So based on this analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z could be:
1. SW (if x is below z)
2. W (if x overlaps with z vertically)
3. NW (if x is above z)
4. W:NW (if part of x is at the same level as z and part is above z)

But wait, let's re-examine this and see if our constraints allow for Case 3 and Case 4.

From the constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SW y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

No, we can't say anything about the case where part of x extends above z. The constraint supy(z) <= infy(y) doesn't provide any information to construct a case where infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) and supy(z) < supy(x).

Given the constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
 
We can't directly determine the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z). Both could be below infy(y), but their relative positions are not constrained.

Let's re-examine this situation:

From x SW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

From the first and third constraints, we know x is to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z).

From the second and fourth constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
 
So both x and z have their tops below the bottom of y. But I can't directly determine the relative heights of x and z.

If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is below z, and the relation is SW.
If supy(x) > infy(z) and supy(z) > infy(x), then x and z overlap vertically, and the relation is W.
If infy(x) >= supy(z), then x is above z, and the relation is NW.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be:
1. SW (if x is below z)
2. W (if x and z overlap vertically)
3. NW (if x is above z)

Actually, I realize there's a fourth possible relation: z could be entirely within the western region of x, in which case the relation would simply be W. Let me check this again.

Actually, based on the definition of the W relation:
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So for x W z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is above the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is below the top of z)

From the constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (from the transitive property of the horizontal constraints)
- We don't have direct constraints on infy(x) and supy(x) relative to infy(z) and supy(z)

So the W relation is a possibility if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Ok, so we can have three single-tile cardinal direction relations:
- SW: if supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely below z)
- W: if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically within z)
- NW: if supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above z)

Additionally, we could have multi-tile relations:
- SW:W: if infy(z) <= supy(x) and infy(x) < infy(z) (part of x is below z and part is at the same level)
- W:NW: if supy(x) > supy(z) and infy(x) <= supy(z) (part of x is at the same level as z and part is above)
- SW:W:NW: if infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z) (x spans below, at, and above z)

Actually, upon reflection, I'm forgetting an important constraint from the problem definition: regions in REG are closed, connected and have connected boundaries.  Given this, and the definitions of cardinal directions, a region can have multiple tile relations with another region, but each relation must be a contiguous set of tiles.  The tiles that can be contiguous are those that share an edge, like (NW, N, W) or (W, SW, S).  So, these multi-tile relations are valid as well.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. SW (if x is entirely below z)
2. W (if x is vertically aligned with z)
3. NW (if x is entirely above z)
4. SW:W (if part of x is below z and part is at the same level)
5. W:NW (if part of x is at the same level as z and part is above)
6. SW:W:NW (if x spans below, at, and above z)

Let me double-check the cardinal direction relation definition again to make sure multi-tile relations are allowed to be declared in this way.

In the given definition, a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where:
1. 1 <= k <= 9
2. R1, ..., Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}
3. Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j
4. There are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG

So, a multi-tile relation is a relation where a region spans multiple basic tiles, and it's expressed as a colon-separated list of the basic tiles it spans.

Given all this, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. SW (if x is entirely below z)
2. W (if x is vertically aligned with z)
3. NW (if x is entirely above z)
4. SW:W (if part of x is below z and part is at the same level)
5. W:NW (if part of x is at the same level as z and part is above)
6. SW:W:NW (if x spans below, at, and above z)

But there's a point 4 in the definition that is quite subtle: "There are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

This means that the union of the regions in each tile should form a valid region (closed, connected, with a connected boundary). 

For example, if a region spans the SW and W tiles, the combined region (union of the parts in SW and W) should form a valid region. 

In the case of x and z, we've deduced that x is to the left of z, but the vertical relationship can vary. Given the constraints, it's possible for x to be entirely below z (SW), vertically aligned with z (W), entirely above z (NW), or span any combination of these vertically neighboring tiles (SW:W, W:NW, or SW:W:NW).

If we're looking for the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z, then the answer is SW, W, or NW.

But if we're including multi-tile relations, then the answer includes SW:W, W:NW, or SW:W:NW.

Wait, I think I might be missing something. Let's go back to the given constraints:

From x SW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z) using transitive property
- We can't directly determine the vertical relationship between x and z

However, looking at the constraints more carefully, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (top of x is below bottom of y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (top of z is below bottom of y)

This means both x and z are below y. But I don't have direct constraints on the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or infy(x) and infy(z).

So, x could be below z, at the same level as z, or above z. 

Wait, let me think again. The constraint supy(z) <= infy(y) means the top of z is below the bottom of y. And supy(x) <= infy(y) means the top of x is below the bottom of y.

So both x and z are entirely below y. But their relative positions to each other in the vertical direction are not constrained by the given information.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. SW (if x is entirely below z)
2. W (if x is vertically aligned with z)
3. NW (if x is entirely above z)
4. SW:W (if part of x is below z and part is at the same level)
5. W:NW (if part of x is at the same level as z and part is above)
6. SW:W:NW (if x spans below, at, and above z)

But I'm not sure if "SW:W:NW" is a valid multi-tile relation. Let me check the definition again.

From the definition, a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where:
1. 1 <= k <= 9
2. R1, ..., Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}
3. Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j
4. There are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG

The fourth point mentions that the union of regions in each tile should form a valid region. 

I think the question is asking for the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z, so this would be SW, W, or NW. If I include multi-tile relations, then SW:W, W:NW, and SW:W:NW are also possible, as long as the region formed by their union is valid (which is ensured by the fourth point in the definition).

But now I think about the constraints of regions and I wonder if SW:W:NW is valid, because for a region to be in NW and SW, it would need to "wrap around" the W tile (since NW and SW don't share an edge), which might not be consistent with the definition of a region in REG.

I don't know for certain, but I'm going to stick with the possible relations being:
1. SW (if x is entirely below z)
2. W (if x is vertically aligned with z)
3. NW (if x is entirely above z)
4. SW:W (if part of x is below z and part is at the same level)
5. W:NW (if part of x is at the same level as z and part is above)

I think I might have misunderstood point 4 in the definition of a cardinal direction relation. Let's re-examine it in the context of the question.

Given the definition, a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where:
1. 1 <= k <= 9
2. R1, ..., Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}
3. Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j
4. There are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG

For the fourth point, I think I misunderstood. It's saying that a region can span multiple tiles, and the parts of the region in each tile, when combined, form a region. It doesn't necessarily relate to whether tiles are contiguous or not.

However, the fact that regions in REG are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries does impose certain constraints. For a region to span multiple tiles, these tiles usually need to be contiguous (share an edge), so that the region remains connected.

In the case of the tiles SW, W, and NW, they are all contiguous. So a region could indeed span tiles SW:W:NW.

So, given our constraints, the possible relations between x and z in terms of cardinal direction relations are:
1. SW (if x is entirely below z)
2. W (if x is vertically aligned with z)
3. NW (if x is entirely above z)
4. SW:W (if x spans the SW and W tiles relative to z)
5. W:NW (if x spans the W and NW tiles relative to z)
6. SW:W:NW (if x spans the SW, W, and NW tiles relative to z)

But as the question is asking for the possible relations between region x and region z, and not the possible single-tile relations, I believe the answer should include all the possibilities, so the output should be:

The possible relations between region x and region z could be: SW, W, NW, SW:W, W:NW, or SW:W:NW.

Actually, I need to consider more deeply what it means for a region to have a multi-tile relation. Looking at the definition:

"There are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

This means a region can be split into multiple sub-regions, each belonging to a different tile. But the union of these sub-regions should still form a valid region. This still does not say anything directly about whether the tiles need to be contiguous.

However, since regions in REG are connected, if a region spans non-contiguous tiles, it would mean the region has parts in tiles between the non-contiguous tiles.

For instance, if a region spans tiles SW and NW, it can't just have parts in SW and NW and nothing in between, because then it wouldn't be connected. It would need to have a part in the tile W (which is between SW and NW), making the multi-tile relation SW:W:NW.

But if the region can span only a corner of each NW and SW tiles, then it's possible to have a connected region that resides only in the NW and SW tiles, not touching the W tile. But this is still a contiguous region in space.

However, the definition of a region being in a tile is that it's completely contained within that tile. For instance, a region a is in the SW tile of region b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b), which means the entirety of region a is to the southwest of region b.

Given all the subtleties, I think the possible relations between x and z in terms of cardinal direction relations are:
1. SW (if x is entirely below z)
2. W (if x is vertically aligned with z)
3. NW (if x is entirely above z)
4. SW:W (if x spans the SW and W tiles relative to z)
5. W:NW (if x spans the W and NW tiles relative to z)
6. SW:W:NW (if x spans the SW, W, and NW tiles relative to z)

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let's use the direct definitions and constraints.

From x SW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

From these, we can infer that x is to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z).

But the vertical relationship between x and z is undetermined. x could be below, at the same level, or above z. So the possible single-tile relations are SW, W, and NW.

For multi-tile relations, a region can span multiple tiles, and the parts of the region in each tile, when combined, form a single region. Since x is to the left of z and can be at any vertical position relative to z, the possible multi-tile relations are SW:W, W:NW, and SW:W:NW (if x spans all three tiles).

Let's see if there are other possible multi-tile relations. Since x is strictly to the left of z, it can't be in tiles S, SE, E, NE, or B relative to z. So the only tiles x can be in are SW, W, and NW. Therefore, the possible multi-tile relations are combinations of SW, W, and NW.

The constraints we've deduced don't restrict x to be within a single tile, so all the multi-tile relations involving SW, W, and NW are possible. That means we should include SW:W, W:NW, and SW:W:NW.

So, the answer is:

SW, W, NW, SW:W, W:NW, SW:W:NW

Wait, I think I got something wrong. The definitions given in the problem statement are for a single-tile cardinal direction relation. But the question is asking for the possible relations between regions x and z, not the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations.

The given definitions define single-tile cardinal direction relations. For instance, the definition of SW is:
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

But the question is asking for the possible relations between region x and region z, not the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations.

So, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z, where a relation can be a single-tile cardinal direction relation or a multi-tile cardinal direction relation.

Wait, let me return to the definition of a cardinal direction relation, specifically point 4:

4. There are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG

This says that for a cardinal direction relation R1: ... : Rk, there are regions a1, ..., ak, where ai belongs to Ri(b). This means ai is in the tile Ri relative to b. The union of a1, ..., ak forms a new region which belongs to REG.

This definition allows for multi-tile relations. For instance, if a region spans both the SW and W tiles relative to another region, the relation would be SW:W.

Given our constraints, the possible relations between x and z are combinations of SW, W, and NW. So the answer should include SW, W, NW, SW:W, W:NW, and SW:W:NW.

But let me check once more whether SW:W:NW is valid. For a region to span tiles SW, W, and NW, it needs to be in all three tiles. Given that regions in REG are connected, this means the region would need to have parts in adjacent tiles, forming a path from SW to NW through W.

So, yes, SW:W:NW is a valid multi-tile relation.

I also need to check whether SW:NW is valid (without W). If a region spans tiles SW and NW without having a part in tile W, it would not be connected, which violates the requirement that regions in REG are connected. So SW:NW is not a valid multi-tile relation.

But wait, the problem statement doesn't say the regions must be connected in the multi-tile case. It only says that the union of the regions in each tile should form a valid region (which is connected). So, if a region has a part in SW and a part in NW, and the union of these parts forms a connected region, then SW:NW could be a valid multi-tile relation.

However, I think the more likely interpretation is that the region in each tile should be connected, and the union of these regions should form a valid region (which would also be connected). In this case, SW:NW (without W) would not be a valid multi-tile relation.

But here I may be overthinking the problem. The definition of a cardinal direction relation says there exists regions a1, …, ak where a1 belongs to R1(b), etc. So each part exists. The definition might allow disjoint parts, so long they form a single region when unioned.

But anyway, since SW and NW are not adjacent, a region would typically need a part in the middle (W) to be connected.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. SW (if x is entirely below z)
2. W (if x is vertically aligned with z)
3. NW (if x is entirely above z)
4. SW:W (if x spans the SW and W tiles relative to z)
5. W:NW (if x spans the W and NW tiles relative to z)
6. SW:W:NW (if x spans the SW, W, and NW tiles relative to z)

Let me check again the definition of cardinal direction relation, to see if it says anything about the requirement that the relation tiles should be adjacent.

I'm rereading the definition, and I don't see any explicit requirement that the tiles in a multi-tile relation must be adjacent. However, because regions have to be in REG, which means they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk and are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries, if a region spans multiple tiles, these tiles are usually contiguous.

But thinking about it, I can imagine a region that spans non-contiguous tiles because of a bottleneck that (if I zoom into the empty W tile) is in fact a tiny protrusion: like a dumbbell shape where the region has most of its area in SW and NW, but a tiny corridor in W (so small that I might mistakenly think the region consists only of the SW and NW tiles). The multi-tile relation would still be SW:W:NW.

Given all the analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
1. SW (if x is entirely below z)
2. W (if x is vertically aligned with z)
3. NW (if x is entirely above z)
4. SW:W (if x spans the SW and W tiles relative to z)
5. W:NW (if x spans the W and NW tiles relative to z)
6. SW:W:NW (if x spans the SW, W, and NW tiles relative to z)

Actually, the question is asking for the possible relations between region x and region z, not for the single-tile relations. So, the answer should include all the possibilities mentioned above: "SW, W, NW, SW:W, W:NW, SW:W:NW".

Actually, I have to be more careful about the definition. Let a be the primary region and b be the reference region.

a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

This means the right edge of a is to the left of the left edge of b, and the top edge of a is below the bottom edge of b.

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

This means a is to the left of b, and a is vertically aligned with b (the bottom of a is not below the bottom of b, and the top of a is not above the top of b).

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

This means the right edge of a is to the left of the left edge of b, and the bottom edge of a is above the top edge of b.

For multi-tile relations, a region can span multiple tiles. For instance, if part of a region is in the SW tile and part is in the W tile (relative to another region), the relation would be SW:W. Similarly, the relation W:NW means part of the region is in the W tile and part is in the NW tile. And SW:W:NW means the region spans all three tiles.

Given our constraints, we know that x is to the left of z, and the vertical relationship can be any combination of below, aligned, or above.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
1. SW (if x is entirely below z)
2. W (if x is vertically aligned with z)
3. NW (if x is entirely above z)
4. SW:W (if part of x is below z and part is aligned)
5. W:NW (if part of x is aligned with z and part is above)
6. SW:W:NW (if x has parts below, aligned, and above z)

So, my final answer for the possible relations between region x and region z is:
SW, W, NW, SW:W, W:NW, SW:W:NW

ANSWER:

From the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

Let me analyze what these tell us:

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

From these constraints:
- By transitivity from the horizontal constraints: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z
- The vertical relationship between x and z is not fully determined by the given constraints

Since x is to the left of z, and can be below, at the same level as, or above z (or any combination thereof), the possible relations are:

SW, W, NW, SW:W, W:NW, SW:W:NW
