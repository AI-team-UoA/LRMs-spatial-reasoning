PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

To find: Possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions:
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For "x is S of y", we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

For "y is SW of z", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now let's try to determine the possible relations between x and z.

First, from "y is SW of z", we have supx(y) <= infx(z).
From "x is S of y", we have supx(x) <= supx(y).
Combining these, we get: supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z).

Second, from "x is S of y", we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
From "y is SW of z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z).
Since supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(y) can be less than, equal to, or greater than supy(y), we can't directly determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). However, if we assume that infy(y) <= supy(y) (which is true for any reasonable region), then:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).

Now, let's analyze the x-coordinate relationships:
- From "x is S of y", we know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
- From "y is SW of z", we know supx(y) <= infx(z).

Combining, we get:
infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

This tells us that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means that x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis.

For the y-coordinate, we've established:
supy(x) <= infy(z)

This means that x is entirely below z on the y-axis.

Based on these, x can be SW, S, or W of z.

Let's verify each of these possibilities:

1. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our deduction)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (true from our deduction)
   So, x can be SW of z.

2. x S z:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (true from our deduction)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (not guaranteed from our deductions)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (not guaranteed from our deductions)
   We're not sure if the x-coordinates align in a way for x to be S of z.

3. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our deduction)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (not guaranteed from our deductions)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (not guaranteed from our deductions)
   We're not sure if the y-coordinates align in a way for x to be W of z.

Let's further analyze the S relation:
For "x is S of z", we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

We already know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means that x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis. So, it's not possible to have infx(z) <= infx(x), as that would mean z starts to the left of x, contradicting our earlier deduction. Thus, x cannot be S of z.

Let's now analyze the W relation:
For "x is W of z", we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've established)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means that x is entirely below z on the y-axis. This contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for the W relation. So, x cannot be W of z.

Actually, I need to be more careful with my reasoning above. Let's think again.

Given:
- x is S of y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is SW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z)

These conditions mean:
- x is entirely below z on the y-axis
- x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis

Now, let's check all 9 possible relationships:

1. x B z: 
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We've established that x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis, so it's not possible to have infx(z) <= infx(x). Thus, x cannot be B of z.

2. x S z:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (true from our deduction)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Again, x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis, so it's not possible to have infx(z) <= infx(x). Thus, x cannot be S of z.

3. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our deduction)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (true from our deduction)
   Both conditions are satisfied, so x can be SW of z.

4. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our deduction)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But we've established that x is entirely below z on the y-axis, so it's not possible to have infy(z) <= infy(x). Thus, x cannot be W of z.

5. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our deduction)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   Since x is entirely below z on the y-axis, it's not possible to have x above z, as required for the NW relation. Thus, x cannot be NW of z.

6. x N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Since x is entirely below z on the y-axis, it's not possible to have x above z, as required for the N relation. Thus, x cannot be N of z.

7. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   Since x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis, it's not possible to have x to the right of z, as required for the NE relation. Also, x is entirely below z on the y-axis, so it's not possible to have x above z. Thus, x cannot be NE of z.

8. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   Since x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis, it's not possible to have x to the right of z, as required for the E relation. Thus, x cannot be E of z.

9. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   Since x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis, it's not possible to have x to the right of z, as required for the SE relation. Thus, x cannot be SE of z.

From the analysis, it seems that the only possible relationship between x and z is SW. However, I need to be more careful here. There are subtleties in the definitions that I might have overlooked.

Let's review the definitions again:

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Given:
- x is S of y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is SW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we've deduced:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z)

These are the only solid constraints we have. We can't make assumptions about the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z) without additional information.

But there's a thing I need to check. One of the constraints for "x is S of y" is infx(y) <= infx(x), and one of the constraints for "y is SW of z" is supx(y) <= infx(z).

From supx(y) <= infx(z), we can't directly relate infx(y) and infx(z). However, since regions are connected, we generally have infx(y) <= supx(y). Thus, infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means infx(y) <= infx(z).

Now, from "x is S of y", we have infx(y) <= infx(x). Combining with infx(y) <= infx(z), we have a scenario where both infx(x) and infx(z) are greater than or equal to infx(y), but we can't determine their direct relationship. Both infx(x) <= infx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) are possibilities based on the given constraints.

Similarly, from "y is SW of z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z). From "x is S of y", we have supy(x) <= infy(y). Since regions are connected, we generally have infy(y) <= supy(y). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).

With these constraints, let's revisit the possible relationships:

1. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis. This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) for the B relation. Thus, x cannot be B of z.

2. x S z:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (true from our deduction)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Again, supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the requirement for infx(z) <= infx(x). Thus, x cannot be S of z.

3. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our deduction)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (true from our deduction)
   Both conditions are satisfied, so x can be SW of z.

4. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our deduction)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The first part is satisfied, but we haven't established a direct relationship between infy(z) and infy(x). So, we need to consider the constraints.
   We know supy(x) <= infy(z) from our deductions. If infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(x), which means the y-coordinates of x don't overlap (which is odd for a region; it would be non-connected). This doesn't make sense for a region. But this contradiction isn't in the formal definition. Let's be more precise.
   Actually, there's no contradiction with the formal definitions. Let's say infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This means supy(x) <= infy(x), which suggests that region x doesn't exist or is not a valid region, based on the definitions. For a valid region x, we should have infy(x) < supy(x). So, the W relation might not be valid depending on the specific regions.

5. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our deduction)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We know supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z on the y-axis. This contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for the NW relation. Thus, x cannot be NW of z.

6. x N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Same issue as with NW. x is entirely below z on the y-axis, which contradicts the requirement for the N relation. Thus, x cannot be N of z.

7. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis. This contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for the NE relation. Also, x is entirely below z on the y-axis, contradicting the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x). Thus, x cannot be NE of z.

8. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis. This contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for the E relation. Thus, x cannot be E of z.

9. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   The second condition is met, but the first one contradicts our established fact that supx(x) <= infx(z). Thus, x cannot be SE of z.

Actually, let me double check the W relation. For W, we need:

- supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our deductions)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). Since we're talking about valid regions, we know infy(x) < supy(x). This gives us: infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z). From this, we can infer that infy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for the W relation. Thus, x cannot be W of z.

So, from the analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is SW.

Just to double-check again, let me be extremely clear about all the relations.

Given:
- x is S of y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is SW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we've established:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

For each possible relation between x and z:

1. B: Need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   Contradicted by supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z.

2. S: Need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Contradicted by supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z.

3. SW: Need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   Both conditions are satisfied.

4. W: Need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   Contradicted by the fact that the y-projection of x is below the y-projection of z.

5. NW: Need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   Contradicted by supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z.

6. N: Need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Contradicted by supy(x) <= infy(z).

7. NE: Need supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   Contradicted by both supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

8. E: Need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   Contradicted by supx(x) <= infx(z).

9. SE: Need supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   Contradicted by supx(x) <= infx(z).

But wait again. I just missed S:SW. What if x is partly S of z and partly SW of z?

Actually, I've been pretty strict in my interpretation. In the given definitions, the relations "S", "SW", "W", etc. are single-tile cardinal direction relations. The question is about the possible relations between region x and region z, which could be a composite of these single-tile relations.

Actually, the relations are meant to be mutually exclusive. A region cannot be both partly S and partly SW of another region. The cardinal direction relation describes the overall relationship.

Ok I think before I thought of the W relationship again, I realized that it's contradicted. For W, we need:

- supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our deductions)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). This means the highest point of x is below the lowest point of z. But the second condition for W requires that the lowest point of z is below or equal to the lowest point of x, which contradicts the fact that the lowest point of z is above the highest point of x.

Alright, let's make a clearer formal approach:

For W:
1. We need supx(x) <= infx(z), which is true.
2. We need infy(z) <= infy(x), meaning the lowest point of z is below or at the same level as the lowest point of x.
3. We need supy(x) <= supy(z), meaning the highest point of x is below or at the same level as the highest point of z.

Let's also consider what it means for supy(x) <= infy(z): The highest point of x is below or at the same level as the lowest point of z. In other words, x is entirely below z on the y-axis.

If infy(z) <= infy(x) (as required for W), it means the lowest point of z is below or at the same level as the lowest point of x. But this contradicts the fact that x is entirely below z, which implies the lowest point of x is below the lowest point of z.

So, the W relation is not possible.

Alright, from the analysis, it seems that the only possible relationship between x and z is SW.

But wait, I think the idea of composite directional relations is important here. The question asks about "possible relations," which suggests we might be looking for a set of single-tile relations that together describe the relation between x and z.

But that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The given relations "x is S of y" and "y is SW of z" are single-tile relations, and we're trying to find the possible single-tile relations between x and z.

Actually, based on the definition provided, a cardinal direction relation can be a composite of one or more of the 9 single-tile relations: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE. It's not just limited to one of the 9, but it could be a combination.

Given the constraints, the only possible relation is SW. But the problem is asking which relations COULD be possible. There might be other possible setups that satisfy the given constraints and allow for other relations.

I think I've been very rigorous in my deduction, and based on all the given definitions and the constraints from the given relations, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

From the definition of cardinal direction relation, which is an expression R1 : ... : Rk, where k can be between 1 and 9, it seems like the relation can be a composite. But, given the constraints from "x is S of y" and "y is SW of z", we've deduced that region x is entirely to the left of region z on the x-axis and entirely below region z on the y-axis. This makes the only possible single-tile relation between x and z be SW. 

Okay, I've been thoroughly rigorous in my analysis. The only possible relation is SW.

But wait, I think I've gotten off track. The definition:

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1, ..., Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

This means that a cardinal direction relation can be composed of multiple single-tile relations.

Let's be absolutely clear. I think I'm getting confused about how to interpret cardinal directional relations. There's the classic 9-tile model where a region can be in a single tile (B, S, SW, etc.) or it can spread across multiple tiles.

In the given context, however, the definition states that a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, suggesting it can be a composite. But the question specifically asks for the relation between x and z, not the relation of some third region to both x and z.

I believe we're looking for the single-tile relation that x has with z. Based on the constraints from "x is S of y" and "y is SW of z", we've deduced that the only possible single-tile relation between x and z is SW.

However, if we're to consider that region x might not be confined to just one tile with respect to z, then we need to determine all the tiles where parts of x can be.

But again, going back to the textbook definition of the single-tile cardinal direction relations:

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b): This means a is entirely below b and its x-extent is contained within the x-extent of b.
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b): This means a is entirely to the left and below b.

The definitions ensure that a region can only have one single-tile relation with another region. If a region spans multiple tiles with respect to another, it would not satisfy any of the single-tile relation definitions, but rather would have a composite relation.

Alright, let's re-approach this problem:

1. The question asks which could be the possible relations between region x and region z.
2. We're given that x is S of y and y is SW of z.
3. The possible answers are N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B, which suggests we're looking for which of these 9 single-tile relations can hold between x and z.

From the given constraints, we've deduced:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) [x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis]
- supy(x) <= infy(z) [x is entirely below z on the y-axis]

These two conditions together are the exact definition of the SW relation. So, the relation between x and z is SW.

From the above, I reachthe conclusion that the only relation between x and z is SW.

Wait, one second. I want to double-check that the way I analyzed the problem is correct. I need to be careful.

The definitions of cardinal direction relations given are for SINGLE-TILE relations.

A cardinal direction relation is an expression that can be composed of one or more of these single-tile relations, but that's for when a region spans multiple tiles with respect to another.

Given the constraints, I believe here we're interpreting the problem on the single-tile granularity. And using the definitions, given "x is S of y" and "y is SW of z", the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, upon further reflection, I am thinking too hard on this problem. The definitions are used to establish specific single-tile relations.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

We want to find out which of the 9 single-tile relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) can hold between x and z.

Using the definitions and the given relations, we've established:
- x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis.
- x is entirely below z on the y-axis.

These two conditions together define the SW relation. Thus, x is SW of z.

Okay, let me double check by drawing a quick picture to see if I can imagine another possible relation.

We know that x is S of y, which means x is below y (and its x-range is within y's x-range).
We know that y is SW of z, which means y is to the left and below z.

Drawing this out:
  z
 /
y
|
x

Where x is below y, and y is to the left and below z. In this configuration, it's clear that x is to the left and below z, which is the SW relation.

However, I realize that the constraint "x is S of y" doesn't entirely pin down x's position. It could be anywhere below y (as long as its x-range is within y's x-range).

Similarly, the constraint "y is SW of z" doesn't entirely pin down y's position. It just needs to be to the left and below z.

Given these loose constraints, can x have any other relation with z? Let's go through the conditions again:

From "x is S of y": 
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is below y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of y]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of y]

From "y is SW of z": 
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(y) <= infy(z) [y is below z]

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) [the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z]

Thus, x is entirely to the left and below z, which is the SW relation.

It's hard to imagine a configuration where x has any other relation with z given these constraints. Therefore, the relation between x and z is SW.

I previously mentioned checking if x could have a composite relation with z, but I think I was overthinking. The question asks for the possible relations, and given the constraints, the only possible relation is SW.

Hm, I'm still not fully sure. Let me trying one more time.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

We want to find out which of the 9 single-tile relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) can hold between x and z.

From the definition of the S relation, "x is S of y" means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [the top of x is below or at the bottom of y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [the left of x is to the right of or at the left of y]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [the right of x is to the left of or at the right of y]

From the definition of the SW relation, "y is SW of z" means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [the right of y is to the left of or at the left of z]
- supy(y) <= infy(z) [the top of y is below or at the bottom of z]

From these, we can directly deduce:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) [the top of x is below the bottom of z]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [the right of x is to the left of the left of z]

This means x is entirely to the left and below z, which corresponds to the SW relation. I can't see how, given the constraints, x can have any other relation with z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is SW.

Wait, I'm not being precise enough. The problem asks "which COULD be the possible relations," not "what IS the relation." That makes me think there are multiple possible answers.

Let's be very meticulous. 

For "x is S of y", we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [the top of x is below or at the bottom of y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [the left of x is to the right of or at the left of y]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [the right of x is to the left of or at the right of y]

For "y is SW of z", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [the right of y is to the left of or at the left of z]
- supy(y) <= infy(z) [the top of y is below or at the bottom of z]

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) [the top of x is below the bottom of z]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [the right of x is to the left of the left of z]

These two conditions directly correspond to the definition of the SW relation. In fact, they are the exact conditions for the SW relation.

Let's again check all the 9 possible relations:

1. x B z: Needs infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the first condition. Thus, x cannot be B of z.

2. x S z: Needs supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Our deduced constraints conflict with the second condition. Thus, x cannot be S of z.

3. x SW z: Needs supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). Both are satisfied by our deduced constraints. Thus, x can be SW of z.

4. x W z: Needs supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is met, but we've also established that the top of x is below the bottom of z, which conflicts with the second condition. Thus, x cannot be W of z.

5. x NW z: Needs supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is met, but we've also established that the top of x is below the bottom of z, which conflicts with the second condition. Thus, x cannot be NW of z.

6. x N z: Needs supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Our deduced constraints conflict with all of these conditions. Thus, x cannot be N of z.

7. x NE z: Needs supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). Our deduced constraints conflict with both of these conditions. Thus, x cannot be NE of z.

8. x E z: Needs supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Our deduced constraints conflict with the first two conditions. Thus, x cannot be E of z.

9. x SE z: Needs supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z). Our deduced constraints conflict with the first condition. Thus, x cannot be SE of z.

From the analysis, it seems that the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, now I'm certain. The only relation between x and z, given the constraints, is SW.

Let's double-check, just to be thorough, whether there's the possibility that x spans multiple tiles with respect to z. But, our deduced constraints show that x is entirely to the left of and below z, which is the definition of the SW relation. So, x can't span multiple tiles with respect to z; it's confined to the SW tile.

Therefore, the answer is SW.

Actually, I should be precise with composite directions. A cardinal direction relation is not just one of the 9 single-tile relations, but it can be a composite of these.

But given our constraints, we've shown that x is entirely to the left and below z, which is the definition of the SW single-tile relation. Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

Maybe let's try again from the beginning one more time, to make sure I've not made a mistake.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

We want to find out which of the 9 single-tile relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) can hold between x and z.

From "x is S of y":
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is below y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [the left of x is to the right of or at the left of y]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [the right of x is to the left of or at the right of y]

From "y is SW of z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(y) <= infy(z) [y is below z]

Now, from these, we can deduce:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). This means the top of x is below the bottom of z.
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This means the right of x is to the left of the left of z.

These two deductions tell us that x is entirely to the left of z and entirely below z, which is the definition of the SW relation.

Given these constraints, it doesn't seem possible for x to have any other relation with z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, one moment. I want to be more careful about the deduction supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).

From "x is S of y", we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
From "y is SW of z", we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

In general, for a region y, we can say infy(y) <= supy(y) (the bottom of y is below or at the top of y).

Combining them, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z.

Actually, I'm being too rigorous. 

For "x is S of y", we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [the top of x is below or at the bottom of y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [the left of x is to the right of or at the left of y]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [the right of x is to the left of or at the right of y]

For "y is SW of z", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [the right of y is to the left of or at the left of z]
- supy(y) <= infy(z) [the top of y is below or at the bottom of z]

From supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we get supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z.

From supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we get supy(x) <= infy(z) only if infy(y) <= supy(y), which is true for any region y. Thus, x is entirely below z.

These two conditions together mean x is to the left and below z, which is the SW relation.

It doesn't seem possible for x to have any other relation with z given the constraints.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, hold on. I don't think the idea of a composite relation vs. a single-tile relation matters in how I'm approaching the problem.

When we're asked about the possible relations between x and z, it's about which of the 9 single-tile relations can hold, not whether x spans multiple tiles with respect to z.

And the only single-tile relation that can hold between x and z, given the constraints, is SW.

So my answer is SW.

Wait, I still don't feel fully confident. Let me do a final, extremely careful analysis:

From "x is S of y", we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [the top of x is below or at the bottom of y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [the left of x is to the right of or at the left of y]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [the right of x is to the left of or at the right of y]

From "y is SW of z", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [the right of y is to the left of or at the left of z]
- supy(y) <= infy(z) [the top of y is below or at the bottom of z]

I want to deduce the relation between x and z.

From the two given relations, we can directly deduce:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z]
- For we know that supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
- It's a property of regions that infy(y) <= supy(y) [the bottom of a region is below or at its top].
- Thus, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) [the top of x is below the bottom of z]

These two deductions tell us that x is entirely to the left of z and entirely below z, which is the definition of the SW relation.

Now, for x to have any other relation with z, it would have to be in a different position relative to z. But our deductions from the given constraints don't allow for that.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is SW.

Alright, I'm completely confident now. The answer is SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of cardinal directions, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From "x is S of y":
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) [x is below y]
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [left boundary constraint]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) [right boundary constraint]

From "y is SW of z":
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) [y is below z]

From these, I can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is entirely below z

These two deductions together match exactly the definition of the SW relation:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.
