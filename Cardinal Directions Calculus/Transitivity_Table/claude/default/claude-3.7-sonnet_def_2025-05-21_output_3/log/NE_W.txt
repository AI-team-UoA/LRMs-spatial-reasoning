PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This problem requires me to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that:
1. Region x is NE of region y
2. Region y is W of region z

Let me work through this step by step using the definitions of cardinal directions.

Given:
- x NE y: This means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y W z: This means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

I need to find the possible relations between x and z.

First, let's look at the constraints on the x-coordinates:
- From x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z)

This doesn't give us a direct constraint between infx(x) and infx(z). However, we can see that both infx(x) and infx(z) are greater than or equal to supx(y).

Now, let's analyze the y-coordinates:
- From x NE y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive: infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x)
This means infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know the relation between supy(z) and supy(x).

Based on these constraints, let's consider the possible cardinal relations:

1. Could x be N of z?
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We already established that infy(z) <= infy(x), which doesn't contradict supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We don't have direct constraints on infx(z) vs infx(x), or supx(x) vs supx(z)
   So, x could be N of z.

2. Could x be NE of z?
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), but we don't know the relation between infx(x) and supx(z)
   - We already established that infy(z) <= infy(x), which doesn't contradict supy(z) <= infy(x)
   So, x could be NE of z.

3. Could x be E of z?
   For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We already established that infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We don't have direct constraints on supx(z) vs infx(x) or supy(x) vs supy(z)
   So, x could be E of z.

4. Could x be SE of z?
   For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We know that infy(z) <= infy(x), which would imply that supy(x) <= infy(z) only if supy(x) <= infy(x)
   - But this would mean that x has no vertical extent, which contradicts the fact that x is a region.
   So, x cannot be SE of z.

5. Could x be S of z?
   For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - As noted above, infy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) unless x has no vertical extent.
   So, x cannot be S of z.

6. Could x be SW of z?
   For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From y W z, we know that supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - From x NE y, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(x) >= supx(y)
   - This doesn't directly give us supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - However, as noted for S, the constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) unless x has no vertical extent.
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. Could x be W of z?
   For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know that infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - However, from x NE y, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of y in terms of x-coordinates.
   - From y W z, we know that supx(y) <= infx(z), which means y is to the west of z in terms of x-coordinates.
   - Combining these, we get: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between infx(x) and infx(z).
   So, given the constraints, x could be W of z.

8. Could x be NW of z?
   For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - As discussed for W, we don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) vs infx(z).
   - We know that infy(z) <= infy(x), which doesn't contradict supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, x could be NW of z.

9. Could x be B (bounding box) of z?
   For x B z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know that infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We don't have direct constraints on the other relations.
   So, x could be B of z.

Let me double check some of these.

For "x W z", I'm concerned about whether this is consistent with "x NE y" and "y W z". If x is NE of y, then x is to the east of y. And if y is W of z, then y is to the west of z. It seems like x should be to the east of z or at least not completely to the west. Let me reconsider.

From "x NE y", we know that supx(y) <= infx(x). This means x is strictly to the east of y in terms of x-coordinates.
From "y W z", we know that supx(y) <= infx(z). This means y is strictly to the west of z in terms of x-coordinates.

Combining these, we get: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between infx(x) and infx(z).

For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But from the given constraints, we don't know if infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). It could be the case that infx(z) <= infx(x).

Let's consider another approach. Using a 2D coordinate system.

Given:
- x NE y: This means x is in the north-east quadrant of y.
- y W z: This means y is in the west side of z.

Let's consider a specific example. Imagine y at the origin (0, 0). Then:
- x NE y means x is somewhere in the quadrant where both x and y coordinates are positive.
- y W z means z is to the east of y, so z has a positive x-coordinate.

Given this, x and z both have positive x-coordinates. But their relative positions can vary. x could be to the west, east, or even overlap with z in terms of x-coordinates. Similarly, for y-coordinates, x is to the north of y, but z's y-coordinate can vary.

Given these possibilities, x can be:
- N of z (if x is directly above z)
- NE of z (if x is to the north-east of z)
- E of z (if x is directly to the east of z)
- NW of z (if x is to the north-west of z)
- B of z (if x is within the bounding box of z)

But x cannot be:
- SE of z (x is to the north of y, which is to the west of z; so x is more northly positioned)
- S of z (same reasoning as SE)
- SW of z (same reasoning as SE and S for the south component, and x is to the east of y which is to the west of z, so x can't be to the southwest of z)

Wait, I'm not being rigorous enough. Let me reconsider a bit more carefully.

Actually, I think I can draw a clearer picture by focusing on what regions in the plane x, y, and z can occupy.

Given y W z:
- y is in the west tile relative to z
- This means y is entirely to the left of z's leftmost point

Given x NE y:
- x is in the northeast tile relative to y
- This means x is entirely to the right of y's rightmost point and entirely above y's topmost point

Now, if we draw this out:
z can be to the right of y.
x is to the right and above y.

Given these constraints, x and z can have various relative positions, but there are some positions they cannot have.

Since x is entirely to the right of y's rightmost point and y is entirely to the left of z's leftmost point, x cannot be entirely to the left of z's leftmost point. This means x cannot be in the W, SW, or NW tile relative to z.

Since x is entirely above y's topmost point, and y is in the W tile relative to z, x cannot be below z's bottommost point. This means x cannot be in the S, SE, or SW tile relative to z.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N
- NE
- E
- B

Let me triple check.

Given y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (west constraint on x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (west constraint on y-axis, meaning y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent)

Given x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (northeast constraint on x-axis)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (northeast constraint on y-axis)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z)

Now, from "supy(y) <= infy(x)" and "infy(z) <= infy(y)", we get "infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)".
This means "infy(z) <= infy(x)" (which means x's lowest point is above or at the same level as z's lowest point).

But we don't have a direct constraint on supy(z) vs infy(x) or supy(z) vs supy(x).

Let's re-check each cardinal relation:

1. N (x N z):
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know about supy(z) vs infy(x).
   - We also don't have direct constraints on infx(z) vs infx(x) or supx(x) vs supx(z).
   So, x could be N of z.

2. NE (x NE z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know about supy(z) vs infy(x).
   - We also don't have a direct constraint on supx(z) vs infx(x).
   So, x could be NE of z.

3. E (x E z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - But we don't have direct constraints on supx(z) vs infx(x) or supy(x) vs supy(z).
   So, x could be E of z.

4. SE (x SE z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) unless x has no vertical extent (which wouldn't be a proper region).
   So, x cannot be SE of z.

5. S (x S z):
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - As for SE, this contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) unless x has no vertical extent.
   So, x cannot be S of z.

6. SW (x SW z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - But we don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) vs infx(z).
   - However, as for S and SE, supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. W (x W z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - But for supx(x) <= infx(z), consider the chains: supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y) and supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z). This doesn't directly tell us about supx(x) vs infx(z).
   - On the other hand, given the narrative of x being to the right of y and y being to the left of z, it's unlikely that x would be entirely to the left of z. But to be rigorous, I need to find a logical contradiction.
   - Let's consider: If x W z, then supx(x) <= infx(z). And if x NE y, then supx(y) <= infx(x). Combining, supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - This doesn't yield a contradiction with the given constraints. So based on the strict inequalities, I can't rule out the possibility of x W z.
   - But there's a nuance here. For X W Z, we need x to be entirely to the left of z. But from the given info, we also know that y is entirely to the left of z, and x is to the northeast of y. It's hard to imagine a scenario where x is entirely to the left of z in this arrangement, especially because x is to the east of y, which is already to the west of z.
   - Let me break down the x-coordinate constraints:
     From (y W z): supx(y) <= infx(z). This means y is entirely to the left of z.
     From (x NE y): supx(y) <= infx(x). This means x is entirely to the right of y.
     Combined: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
     If we assume (x W z): supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is entirely to the left of z.
     Combined with (x NE y): supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z).
     This doesn't lead to a contradiction, so I can't rule out x W z based solely on the x-coordinate constraints.
   So, x could be W of z, but it seems unlikely given the narrative.

8. NW (x NW z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know about supy(z) vs infy(x).
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), the same reasoning as for W applies.
   So, like for W, I can't strictly rule out x NW z, but it seems unlikely given the narrative.

9. B (x B z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - But we don't have direct constraints on the other relations.
   So, x could be B of z.

Hmm, I'm finding it hard to directly rule out x W z.
But maybe I can reason a bit differently.
From x NE y, we know that x is in the northeast quadrant of y. From y W z, we know that y is to the west of z. Given these, the most natural placement of x would be somewhere to the north or northeast of z. It's hard to imagine a scenario where x is entirely to the west of z given these constraints.

Let me try to be more rigorous:

From x NE y, we know that x is in the northeast quadrant of y. This means infx(x) >= supx(y) (x is to the east of y) and infy(x) >= supy(y) (x is to the north of y).

From y W z, we know that y is to the west of z. This means supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z) and y is aligned with z in the y-direction (infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)).

So, we have infx(x) >= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z). If infx(x) >= infx(z), then x is to the east of z, which means x cannot be W, SW, or NW of z.

But if infx(x) < infx(z), then x is not entirely to the east of z. Moreover, if supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is entirely to the west of z, which is W, SW, or NW depending on the y-directionm. But there's a constraint that infy(x) >= supy(y), which makes SW less likely.

Wait, I'm complicating this. Let me go back to the basic constraints and reason more carefully.

From the given constraints, we know:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) from (x NE y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) from (y W z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) from (x NE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) from (y W z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) from (y W z)

From the fourth and fifth constraints, we can infer infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which simply states that y is vertically aligned with z (infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)).

From the third constraint, we know supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is entirely above y. Combined with the fact that infy(z) <= infy(y), we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This means x is above y, and infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's lowest point is at or above z's lowest point).

From the first and second constraints, we get supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between infx(x) and infx(z). x could be to the east of z, or they could overlap, or x could even be entirely to the west of z.

So, based on the constraints, x can be in the N, NE, E, NW, W, or B position relative to z. It cannot be in the SE, S, or SW position because x must be entirely above y, and y is vertically aligned with z, so x cannot be below z.

Wait, I need to double-check NW and W:

For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- We know infy(z) <= infy(x) (derived from the given constraints), but this doesn't contradict supy(z) <= infy(x).
- For supx(x) <= infx(z), we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y) and supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z). But this doesn't directly tell us about supx(x) vs infx(z).

For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- We know infy(z) <= infy(x).
- For supx(x) <= infx(z), the same reasoning as for NW applies.
- For supy(x) <= supy(z), we don't have a direct constraint, but we can consider the following:
  From x NE y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is entirely above y.
  From y W z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means y is vertically aligned with z.
  If infy(x) is way above supy(y), and infy(y) is close to infy(z), it's possible that supy(x) is below supy(z). But if infy(x) is close to supy(y), and supy(z) is close to supy(y), then supy(x) might be above supy(z).
  So, I can't definitively rule out x W z.

For completeness, let me also verify the B relation:

For x B z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- We know infy(z) <= infy(x).
- For the other constraints, we don't have direct information, so x B z is a possibility.

Based on the constraints, it seems like the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (but only if x and z are aligned in the x-direction)
- NE
- E (but only if x and z are aligned in the y-direction)
- NW (but this requires x to be entirely to the west of z, which seems against the narrative)
- W (but, as for NW, this requires x to be entirely to the west of z, which seems against the narrative)
- B (if x is within the bounding box of z)

Actually, I'm overthinking this problem. I should be strictly sticking to the constraints.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, I can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z)

I can now check each of the nine cardinal direction relations to see if they can be satisfied given the above constraints:

1. N (x N z):
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), but this doesn't directly tell us about supy(z) vs infy(x).
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), but this doesn't directly tell us about infx(z) vs infx(x).
   - We have no constraints on supx(x) vs supx(z).
   Based on the constraints, x could be N of z.

2. NE (x NE z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We have no direct constraint on supx(z) vs infx(x).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), but this doesn't directly tell us about supy(z) vs infy(x).
   Based on the constraints, x could be NE of z.

3. E (x E z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We have no direct constraint on supx(z) vs infx(x).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have no direct constraint on supy(x) vs supy(z).
   Based on the constraints, x could be E of z.

4. SE (x SE z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We have no direct constraint on supx(z) vs infx(x).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
     But this contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z), as it would mean supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), making supy(x) <= infy(x), which is impossible for a valid region x.
   So, x cannot be SE of z.

5. S (x S z):
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - As in SE, supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) for a valid region x.
   So, x cannot be S of z.

6. SW (x SW z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(z), but we don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) vs infx(z).
   - As in S and SE, supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) for a valid region x.
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. W (x W z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), but this doesn't directly constrain supx(x) vs infx(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have no direct constraint on supy(x) vs supy(z).
   Based on the constraints, x could be W of z.

8. NW (x NW z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), but this doesn't directly constrain supx(x) vs infx(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), but this doesn't directly tell us about supy(z) vs infy(x).
   Based on the constraints, x could be NW of z.

9. B (x B z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We don't have direct constraints on the other three relations.
   Based on the constraints, x could be B of z.

Based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, W, NW, and B. The relations SE, S, and SW are not possible.

However, I should clarify a subtle point about the constraints. The constraint "infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)" doesn't guarantee that infy(x) > supy(z). It only tells us that infy(x) > infy(z). With this in mind, I can't directly rule out some of the relations based solely on this constraint.

Let me revisit the constraints once more to check:

We know:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is vertically aligned with z, y's lowest point is at or above z's lowest point)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically aligned with z, y's highest point is at or below z's highest point)

With these clarifications, I can re-check if each of the nine cardinal direction relations can be satisfied:

1. N (x N z):
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), but that doesn't directly constrain supy(z) vs infy(x).
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), but that doesn't directly constrain infx(z) vs infx(x).
   - No direct constraint on supx(x) vs supx(z).
   So, x could be N of z.

2. NE (x NE z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - No direct constraint on supx(z) vs infx(x).
   - Same issue with supy(z) vs infy(x) as in N.
   So, x could be NE of z.

3. E (x E z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - No direct constraint on supx(z) vs infx(x).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - No direct constraint on supy(x) vs supy(z).
   So, x could be E of z.

4. SE (x SE z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - No direct constraint on supx(z) vs infx(x).
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we would need x to be entirely below z. But we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's lowest point is at or below y's lowest point). This doesn't give a direct contradiction, but it seems geometrically unlikely: if x is entirely above y, and z extends down to or below y, it's hard to see how x could be entirely below z.
   - But let's check directly. If supy(x) <= infy(z), and we know supy(y) <= infy(x), then supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This would mean supy(y) <= infy(z), which doesn't directly contradict infy(z) <= infy(y) unless we have infy(y) <= supy(y), which would be the case for a valid region y.
   So, x cannot be SE of z because it would mean supy(y) <= infy(z) <= infy(y), making supy(y) <= infy(y), which is impossible for a valid region y.

5. S (x S z):
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - No direct constraint on infx(z) vs infx(x) or supx(x) vs supx(z).
   - As in SE, supy(x) <= infy(z) would lead to the contradiction supy(y) <= infy(y).
   So, x cannot be S of z.

6. SW (x SW z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), we would need x to be entirely to the west of z. This doesn't immediately contradict the given constraints, but it's geometrically unlikely: if x is to the northeast of y, and y is to the west of z, it's hard to see how x could be entirely to the west of z.
   - As in S and SE, supy(x) <= infy(z) leads to a contradiction.
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. W (x W z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - No direct constraint on supy(x) vs supy(z).
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), as in SW, it doesn't immediately contradict the constraints, but it's geometrically unlikely.
   - But let's check directly. If supx(x) <= infx(z), and we know supx(y) <= infx(x), then supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). This would mean supx(y) <= infx(z), which is already one of our constraints. So there's no contradiction.
   So, based on the constraints, x could be W of z.

8. NW (x NW z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), the same reasoning as in W applies, and there's no contradiction.
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have a direct constraint from the given information.
   So, x could be NW of z.

9. B (x B z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - No direct constraint on the other three relations.
   So, x could be B of z.

Let's double-check the reasoning for SE (and consequently S and SW) once more:

For x SE z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
- If supy(x) <= infy(z), and we know supy(y) <= infy(x), then supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z).
- This gives us supy(y) <= infy(z).
- But we also know infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z). Combined, supy(y) <= infy(z) <= infy(y).
- This would mean supy(y) <= infy(y), which is impossible for a valid region y.

So, x cannot be SE of z, and by similar reasoning, x cannot be S or SW of z.

Wait, actually infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) is not a contradiction. A valid region y would have infy(y) < supy(y) (i.e., y's lowest point is below its highest point). 

Let me recheck our constraints one by one:

We know:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For SE, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).

From supy(y) <= infy(x) (x NE y), I know x is entirely above y.
From infy(z) <= infy(y) (y W z), I know z's lowest point is at or below y's lowest point.

If x is entirely above y, and z's lowest point is at or below y's lowest point, then it's hard to see how x could be entirely below z. But I need to check this rigorously.

For a valid region x, infy(x) <= supy(x).
For a valid region y, infy(y) <= supy(y).
For a valid region z, infy(z) <= supy(z).

If supy(x) <= infy(z) (a requirement for SE), then every point of x is below every point of z.
But I know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y), which means every point of y is below every point of x.
And I know infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z), which means z's lowest point is at or below y's lowest point.

Combining, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
But this contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (the requirement for SE).

So, x cannot be SE of z.

By similar reasoning, x cannot be S or SW of z, as these also require supy(x) <= infy(z).

For W, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
I can't derive a direct contradiction from the given constraints. So, based on the constraints, x could be W of z.

Similarly, for NW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
Again, I can't derive a direct contradiction from the given constraints. So, x could be NW of z.

For B, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- I know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).
- For the other three relations, I don't have direct constraints.
So, x could be B of z.

Actually I think I've been making a mistake in my derivations. When I say infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), I'm implicitly assuming that infy(y) <= supy(y), which is true for a valid region. But I'm not explicitly applying the constraint directly.

Here's the correct approach:

We know:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For a valid region y, infy(y) < supy(y) (y's lowest point is below its highest point).

Combining, infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
This gives us infy(z) < infy(x).

For SE, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
For a valid region x, infy(x) < supy(x).
So, infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z).
But I also have infy(z) < infy(x), which combined gives infy(z) < infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z).
This is a contradiction, as we'd have infy(z) < infy(z).

So, x cannot be SE of z.

By similar reasoning, x cannot be S or SW of z, as these also require supy(x) <= infy(z).

For W, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
From x NE y, I have supx(y) <= infx(x).
There's no direct contradiction with supx(x) <= infx(z).

Similarly, for NW, I can't derive a direct contradiction from the given constraints.

For B, similarly, I can only infer infy(z) < infy(x), but I don't have constraints on the other relations.

Alright, let's finalize.

Based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, W, NW, and B.
The relations SE, S, and SW are not possible because they require x to be entirely below z, which contradicts the constraints.

Actually, there's one more subtlety we need to consider. For a cardinal direction relation R1:...:Rk, the regions a1, ..., ak must collectively form a valid region.

For the relation N, we require that supy(z) <= infy(x). But from our constraints, we can only infer infy(z) < infy(x), we don't know about supy(z).

Similarly, for NE, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), and for E, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Our constraints don't directly provide these.

For simplicity, let's assume that the regions can be positioned such that the required constraints for each relation can be satisfied.

In summary, based on the constraints and with our assumptions, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, W, NW, and B.

Hmm, I've been overthinking again. Let's be more basic.

From the given constraints, there are certain geometric configurations that are possible and others that are not.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let me approach the problem by testing our constraints against the definitions of each cardinal relation.
Actually, first let me redraw everything.

x NE y means x is in the north-east quadrant of y. i.e., x is strictly to the east and strictly to the north of y.
y W z means y is in the west tile of z. i.e., y is strictly to the west of z.

I'll visualize this on an informal 2D plane. I'll place y at (0, 0).
- If y is at (0, 0) and x is NE of y, then x is in the quadrant (x > 0, y > 0).
- If y is at (0, 0) and y is W of z, then z is to the east of y, so z is somewhere in the area (x > 0, any y).

With these positions, x and z are both to the east of y. But x is also strictly to the north of y, while z can be anywhere vertically. Thus, x can be:
- NE of z (if x is northeast of z)
- N of z (if x is directly north of z)
- NW of z (if x is northwest of z, but still east of y)
- E of z (if x is directly east of z)
- B of z (if x is within the bounding box of z)

x cannot be:
- SE, S, or SW of z because x is strictly to the north of y, and z's vertical extent includes y (from y W z), so x cannot be entirely to the south of z.
- W of z because x is strictly to the east of y, and y is strictly to the west of z, so x cannot be entirely to the west of z.

Actually, let me contradict this. W can be true if x is to the East of y, but still to the west of z.
Actually, let me make a minor correction. For y W z, the constraint is that y is in the west tile of z, which means y is strictly to the west of z. So, z is to the east of y. For x NE y, x is to the northeast of y, which means x is strictly to the east and strictly to the north of y.
Given these, x is to the east of y, and z is also to the east of y. But this doesn't constrain the relative positions of x and z in the east-west direction. x could be to the east, west, or overlap with z.

So, the possible cardinal directions are: N, NE, E, NW, W, and B. The directions SE, S, and SW are not possible.

But wait, there was a geometrical constraint we figured out: infy(z) < infy(x), so z extends lower than x. This means that x cannot be entirely below z, which is the requirement in the SE, S, and SW relations.

By the same constraint, z extends below x. Combined with the requirement of W that supx(x) <= infx(z), we can try to visually determine if x can truly be W of z. Consider y at (0, 0), z at (1, 0), and x at (0.5, 1). This way, x is NE of y, y is W of z, and x is W of z (x is at x=0.5, while z starts at x=1).

So, I believe x could be W of z.

Similar reasoning applies to NW. Consider y at (0, 0), z at (1, -0.5), and x at (0.5, 1). Then x is NE of y, y is W of z, and x is NW of z (x is to the west of z and z is below x).

Overall, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, W, NW, and B. The relations SE, S, and SW are not possible.

However, let me double-check the W case more carefully.

For x W z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
From x NE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
From y W z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z).
So, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z).
There's no contradiction. x could be W of z.

But, wait, let me reason differently.

For x NE y, x is in the northeast quadrant of y, which means x is strictly to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x).
For y W z, y is in the west tile of z, which means y is strictly to the west of z: supx(y) <= infx(z).
For x W z, x would be in the west tile of z, which means x is strictly to the west of z: supx(x) <= infx(z).

Now, from the constraints:
supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z).
There's no contradiction.

However, the issue with the W and NW relations is that they require x to be entirely to the west of z. But given that x is to the east of y (from x NE y), and y is to the west of z (from y W z), it seems geometrically unlikely for x to be entirely to the west of z.

Actually, I need to be more precise. The constraint y W z also implies that y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent:

infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Similarly, the constraints for the cardinal relations involve both x and y-coordinates.

If I try to draw a configuration where x is W of z, given x NE y and y W z, I would have:
- x is to the east of y (from x NE y): supx(y) <= infx(x).
- x is to the north of y (from x NE y): supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y is to the west of z (from y W z): supx(y) <= infx(z).
- y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent (from y W z): infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
- For x to be W of z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Hmm, I'm getting confused again.
Let me try a slightly different approach.

Consider a simple geometric model.
- Let's place y at (0, 0), i.e., y is a region with its center at the origin.
For x NE y, this means x is in the northeast quadrant of y. Let's say x is at (1, 1).
For y W z, this means y is strictly to the west of z. Let's say z is at (2, 0).

In this configuration, x is at (1, 1), y is at (0, 0), and z is at (2, 0). We have:
- x is NE of y.
- y is W of z.
- x is at (1, 1), which is to the west of z at (2, 0). So, x is in the NW tile of z.

So, NW is a possible relation.

Similarly, I can consider other configurations and check which cardinal relations can be satisfied.

Given x NE y and y W z, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, NW, and B. The relations SE, S, SW, and W are not possible.

Actually, I'm forgetting to check infy(z) < infy(x), which means z extends lower than x. This means that x cannot be below z, which would rule out the SE, S, and SW relations.

I'm forgetting the original definition. The constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) from y W z doesn't necessarily mean infy(z) < infy(x) unless combined with the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x) from x NE y. So I have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives infy(z) <= infy(x).

So, x cannot be below z, which means the relations SE, S, and SW are not possible.

But I'm not sure about W. The statement "x W z" means x is to the west of z and aligned vertically with z. The latter means x's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first constraint, infy(z) <= infy(x), is satisfied. But the second constraint, supy(x) <= supy(z), isn't directly addressed by the given constraints.

If I draw a possible configuration where x is to the northeast of y, and y is to the west of z, I can position x and z such that x's vertical extent is not entirely within z's vertical extent, which would mean x is not W of z. But I can also position them such that x's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent, in which case x could be W of z.

So, the possible relations are: N, NE, E, NW, W, and B. The relations SE, S, and SW are not possible.

And I'd like to double-check W one more time. Looking at the definition, for x W z we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For x NE y:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

For y W z:
supx(y) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, do these allow for x W z?
For the first requirement of W, supx(x) <= infx(z), given the constraints, we can only derive supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), which doesn't constrain supx(x) vs infx(z). So, x could be entirely to the west of z, or it could overlap or be entirely to the east.

For the second requirement of W, infy(z) <= infy(x), combining the constraints, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which satisfies this requirement.

For the third requirement of W, supy(x) <= supy(z), the given constraints don't directly address this. But if we choose a configuration where x is not too high and z is high enough, this can be satisfied.

Actually, for a W relation, the reference object should be entirely to the east of the primary object:
supx(x) <= infx(z)

But wait, if x is to the northeast of y, and y is to the west of z, how can x be entirely to the west of z? Let's think this through.

For x NE y, x is to the east of y, because supx(y) <= infx(x)
For y W z, y is to the west of z, because supx(y) <= infx(z).

For x to be W of z, x would need to be entirely to the west of z, because supx(x) <= infx(z).

But if x is to the east of y, and y is to the west of z, then the leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of y, and the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z. This gives us a chain: supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). This doesn't constrain supx(x) vs infx(z).

So, x could be to the west of z, even if it's to the east of y, as long as x is properly positioned.

Let me draw a concrete example to check.
Let's say:
- y is at (-2, 0) and has a width of 2, so its x-extent is [-3, -1].
- z is at (2, 0) and has a width of 2, so its x-extent is [1, 3].
- x is at (0, 2) and has a width of 1, so its x-extent is [-0.5, 0.5].

With this setup, supx(y) = -1, infx(x) = -0.5, supx(x) = 0.5, and infx(z) = 1. We have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y). i.e., -1 <= -0.5 (true)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z). i.e., -1 <= 1 (true)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (for x W z). i.e., 0.5 <= 1 (true)

So, x could be W of z.

Actually, I made a mistake. The constraint from x NE y is more strict. For x to be in the northeast quadrant of y, it's not just about the x-extents. The constraint supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y) mean that every point of x is to the east and north of every point of y.

For y W z, the constraint is that every point of y is to the west of every point of z, and y and z are vertically aligned.

The key insight is that the position of x is relative to y, and the position of y is relative to z. The position of x relative to z is determined via transitive logic.

With these stricter definitions, if x is to the northeast of y, and y is to the west of z, then x could be to the northwest of z, because both y and x could be to the north of z, but y is to the west of z, and x is to the east of y.

After thinking further, I believe the correct answer is: N, NE, E, NW, and B. The relations SE, S, SW, and W are not possible.

Actually, I think the big mistake I've been making is reasoning as if relations were between points, but the relations are between regions. Let me try to set this straight:

x NE y means: the region x is in the northeast tile of region y.
y W z means: the region y is in the west tile of region z.

The possible cardinal relations from x to z are those that are consistent with the above.

Let's analyze each of the possible five-tile relations:

1. N (x N z):
   - x is to the north of z. This means every point of x is above every point of z.
   - If x is to the northeast of y, then every point of x is to the east and north of every point of y.
   - If y is to the west of z, then every point of y is to the west of every point of z, and y and z are vertically aligned.
   - Given these, it's possible for x to be to the north of z.
   So, N is a possible relation.

2. NE (x NE z):
   - x is to the northeast of z. This means every point of x is to the east and north of every point of z.
   - If x is to the northeast of y, then every point of x is to the east and north of every point of y.
   - If y is to the west of z, then every point of y is to the west of every point of z, and y and z are vertically aligned.
   - Given these, it's possible for x to be to the northeast of z.
   So, NE is a possible relation.

3. E (x E z):
   - x is to the east of z. This means every point of x is to the east of every point of z, and x and z are vertically aligned.
   - If x is to the northeast of y, then every point of x is to the east and north of every point of y.
   - If y is to the west of z, then every point of y is to the west of every point of z, and y and z are vertically aligned.
   - Given these, it's possible for x to be to the east of z.
   So, E is a possible relation.

4. SE (x SE z):
   - x is to the southeast of z. This means every point of x is to the east and south of every point of z.
   - If x is to the northeast of y, then every point of x is to the east and north of every point of y.
   - If y is to the west of z, then every point of y is to the west of every point of z, and y and z are vertically aligned.
   - Given that x is to the north of y, and y is vertically aligned with z, it's not possible for x to be to the south of z. Therefore, x cannot be to the southeast of z.
   So, SE is not a possible relation.

5. S (x S z):
   - x is to the south of z. This means every point of x is below every point of z.
   - If x is to the northeast of y, then every point of x is to the east and north of every point of y.
   - If y is to the west of z, then every point of y is to the west of every point of z, and y and z are vertically aligned.
   - Given that x is to the north of y, and y is vertically aligned with z, it's not possible for x to be to the south of z.
   So, S is not a possible relation.

6. SW (x SW z):
   - x is to the southwest of z. This means every point of x is to the west and south of every point of z.
   - If x is to the northeast of y, then every point of x is to the east and north of every point of y.
   - If y is to the west of z, then every point of y is to the west of every point of z, and y and z are vertically aligned.
   - Given that x is to the east of y, and y is to the west of z, it's not possible for x to be to the west of z. Furthermore, given that x is to the north of y, and y is vertically aligned with z, it's not possible for x to be to the south of z. Therefore, x cannot be to the southwest of z.
   So, SW is not a possible relation.

7. W (x W z):
   - x is to the west of z. This means every point of x is to the west of every point of z, and x and z are vertically aligned.
   - If x is to the northeast of y, then every point of x is to the east and north of every point of y.
   - If y is to the west of z, then every point of y is to the west of every point of z, and y and z are vertically aligned.
   - Given that x is to the east of y, and y is to the west of z, it's not possible for x to be to the west of z.
   So, W is not a possible relation.

8. NW (x NW z):
   - x is to the northwest of z. This means every point of x is to the west and north of every point of z.
   - If x is to the northeast of y, then every point of x is to the east and north of every point of y.
   - If y is to the west of z, then every point of y is to the west of every point of z, and y and z are vertically aligned.
   - Given that x is to the east of y, and y is to the west of z, it's not clear that x is to the west of z. But maybe you could have y exactly to the west of z, and x to the northeast of y, but still to the west of z.
   Actually, let's see if this works. If supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y) and supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z), then x could be to the east of y, and still both y and x could be to the west of z.
