PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step-by-step.

Given information:
1. Region x is W of region y, which means x W y
2. Region y is S of region z, which means y S z

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Using the definitions provided:
- x W y means: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y S z means: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let me visualize this setup and then determine what constraints this puts on the relationship between x and z.

Since x is W of y:
- x is entirely to the left of y: supx(x) <= infx(y)
- x's vertical extent is contained within y's vertical extent: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

Since y is S of z:
- y is entirely below z: supy(y) <= infy(z)
- y's horizontal extent is contained within z's horizontal extent: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now I'll analyze the possible positions of x relative to z:

From x W y and y S z, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is left of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends at least as far left as y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as y)

Also:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is above or at y's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is below or at y's top)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) don't directly constrain the relationship between x and z horizontally
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z) implies supy(y) <= infy(z) and infy(y) <= infy(x)

Let's consider all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. Can x B z?
   For x B z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   But we know supy(y) <= infy(z) and infy(y) <= infy(x), which means x's vertical position likely doesn't overlap with z's. So x B z seems unlikely.

2. Can x S z?
   For x S z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We know supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), thus supy(x) <= infy(z) is satisfied.
   We don't have enough constraints to ensure infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So x S z is possible.

3. Can x SW z?
   For x SW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   We know supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z) is satisfied.
   We know supx(x) <= infx(y), but not necessarily supx(x) <= infx(z). However, if infx(z) < infx(y), this is possible. So x SW z is possible.

4. Can x W z?
   For x W z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We know supx(x) <= infx(y), but not necessarily supx(x) <= infx(z).
   We also know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). So x W z is not possible.

5. Can x NW z?
   For x NW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   We know supx(x) <= infx(y), but not necessarily supx(x) <= infx(z).
   We also know infy(y) <= infy(x), but there's no constraint relating infy(x) to supy(z). Since y is entirely below z, and x's vertical extent is within y's, it's unlikely for x to be above z. So x NW z seems unlikely.

6. Can x N z?
   For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)

   Since y is S of z and x W of y, it's unlikely for x to be N of z. So x N z seems unlikely.

7. Can x NE z?
   For x NE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   Since x is W of y and y is horizontally contained within z, it's unlikely for x to be east of z. So x NE z seems unlikely.

8. Can x E z?
   For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

   Since x is W of y and y is horizontally contained within z, it's unlikely for x to be east of z. So x E z seems unlikely.

9. Can x SE z?
   For x SE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z) is satisfied.
   However, since x is W of y and y is horizontally contained within z, it's unlikely for x to be east of z. So x SE z seems unlikely.

Let me refine my analysis:

1. x W y means: x is entirely to the left of y, and x's vertical extent is within y's vertical extent.
2. y S z means: y is entirely below z, and y's horizontal extent is within z's horizontal extent.

Given these constraints, let's visualize. If we place z at the top, y directly below it (but with its horizontal extent within z), and x to the left of y (with its vertical extent within y), then x could be:

- SW of z: If x is to the left of z's left boundary and below z.
- S of z: If x is horizontally within z's extent and below z.
- W of z: If x is to the left of z and vertically overlapping with z.

Actually, wait, I need to be more careful. Let's reconsider the constraints:

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is above or at y's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is below or at y's top)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's left boundary is left of or at y's left boundary)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right boundary is right of or at z's right boundary)

Let's analyze again:

1. Horizontally, x is left of y, and z extends at least as far left as y. This means x can be left of z, or potentially overlap horizontally with z if z extends far enough to the left.

2. Vertically, x's extent is within y's, and y is below z. This means x is below z as well.

So the possible relations are:

- S: If x is horizontally within z but below it.
- SW: If x is left of z and below it.
- W: If x is left of z and vertically overlapping with it.

But wait, is W possible? We know x's vertical extent is within y's, and y is entirely below z. This means x is also entirely below z. So x cannot vertically overlap with z, which rules out W.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S: If x is horizontally within z but below it.
- SW: If x is left of z and below it.

Hmm, let me think about this more carefully. Let's be really precise about the constraints:

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) => no direct constraint between supx(x) and infx(z)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z)

So, x is below z. But horizontally, x could be left of z (if supx(x) <= infx(z)), or partially/fully overlap with z horizontally.

OK, let's reassess each possible relationship:

1. B: For this, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). But since supy(x) <= infy(z), we have a contradiction with infy(z) <= infy(x). So, B is not possible.

2. S: For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). We know supy(x) <= infy(z). But for the horizontal constraint, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), which isn't guaranteed by our given constraints. So, S is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x).

3. SW: For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supy(x) <= infy(z). And for supx(x) <= infx(z), it's not directly implied by our constraints, but it's a possible configuration. So, SW is possible.

4. W: For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, W is not possible.

5. NW: For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(x) <= infy(z), so if supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(z) <= supy(x), which doesn't make sense given the definition of supy. So, NW is not possible.

6. N: For this, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Using similar reasoning as for NW, this is not possible.

7. NE: For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). Using similar reasoning, this is not possible.

8. E: For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, using the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z), this is not possible.

9. SE: For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supy(x) <= infy(z). But for supx(z) <= infx(x), it contradicts our knowledge that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). So, SE is not possible.

Hmm, I need to rethink this.

Ok, let me first draw this out and see if I can determine the relative positions of the three regions. If x is W of y and y is S of z, then z is to the north of y and y is to the east of x. We could have something like:

```
    z
    |
y
|
    x
```

But this is just one possible configuration. The cardinal directions are not strict lines but rather regions. So, let's consider a more general case:

```
   [----z----]
       |
   [--y--]
       |
[--x--]
```

In this picture, x is west of y, and y is south of z. This shows that x could be southwest of z.

But there are other possible configurations. For instance, z could extend far to the left, covering x horizontally:

```
[------z------]
       |
   [--y--]
       |
[--x--]
```

In this case, x is south of z.

Now, let's use the definitions rigorously. For cardinal directions, we divide the 2D space into 9 tiles based on the reference object's bounding box.

For the relation between x and z, z is the reference object. We need to determine which tile of z region x falls into.

From our constraints:

1. x W y means x is entirely to the left of y and vertically within y's extent.
2. y S z means y is entirely below z and horizontally within z's extent.

Combine these, and we know x is to the left of y and below the level of z.

Possible relations between x and z:

1. SW: If x is to the left of z's bounding box and below it.
2. S: If x is horizontally within z's bounding box but below it.
3. W: If x is to the left of z's bounding box but vertically overlapping with it.

Since y is entirely below z and x's vertical extent is within y's, x must also be below z. This rules out W.

For S, we need x to be horizontally within z's bounding box. This is possible if z's bounding box extends far enough to the left to include x.

For SW, we need x to be to the left of z's bounding box. This is possible if z's bounding box doesn't extend to include x horizontally.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S and SW.

Actually, let's be careful and check the definitions once more:

a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Now, let's apply our constraints:

For x SW z:
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so the vertical constraint is satisfied
- For the horizontal constraint, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). But these don't directly give us supx(x) <= infx(z). However, it's a possible configuration.

For x S z:
- We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so the vertical constraint is satisfied
- For the horizontal constraints, we need to ensure infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Given the constraints, these conditions are possible but not guaranteed.

For x W z:
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x)
- So, W is not possible.

Actually, let me try thinking about which tiles of z that x can be in. I know for certain that x is below z. And it could be either to the left of z or horizontally overlapping with z.

Let's add in one more possible relation: x might be SouthWest, South, and SouthEast of z. For x to be Southeast of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so the vertical constraint is satisfied. For the horizontal constraint, we have infx(x) and I need to compare it with supx(z). But we don't have direct constraints related to supx(z).

However, we do know that supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), and that infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z). So infx(y) <= supx(z).

This gives us:
supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(z)

But this doesn't imply supx(z) <= infx(x). In fact, it suggests the opposite.

So, I don't think x SE z is possible.

The only two possibilities are x SW z and x S z.

Let me double-check on the case where x might be W of z:

For x W z:
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). But this means supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement that x should vertically overlap with z for x W z.

So, W is not a possible relation.

It seems that the possible relations are:

- SW: If x is to the southwest of z.
- S: If x is to the south of z.

Wait I think there's an issue with my analysis. When reviewing the constraints, I realized that I might have misunderstood the vertical constraints for x W y. Let's review:

x W y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): x is entirely to the left of y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x): x's bottom is above or at y's bottom.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): x's top is below or at y's top.

The interpretation I gave earlier, that x's vertical extent is contained within y's, is correct.

And for y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z): y is entirely below z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y): y's left boundary is to the right or at z's left boundary.
- supx(y) <= supx(z): y's right boundary is to the left or at z's right boundary.

Combining these, I get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but this doesn't give a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x is below z.

For x to be in the southwest of z (x SW z), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): x is entirely to the left of z.
- supy(x) <= infy(z): x is entirely below z.

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), so the vertical constraint is met. For the horizontal constraint, supx(x) <= infx(z), we don't have a direct relation.

Actually wait, I realized that y being S of z means y's vertical extent is below z's. And x W of y means that x's vertical extent is within y's vertical extent. So, x must also be below z, which means supy(x) <= infy(z).

Given our cardinal direction framework, and knowing that x is definitely below z, the possible directions for x relative to z are:
- SW: If x is to the left of z.
- S: If x horizontally overlaps with z.
- SE: If x is to the right of z.

Now let's check each:

For x SW z:
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We've established supy(x) <= infy(z)
- For supx(x) <= infx(z), we don't have a direct relationship. But it's possible for x to be to the left of z.

For x S z:
- We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- We've established supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We don't have a direct relationship for the horizontal constraints, but it's possible for x to horizontally overlap with z.

For x SE z:
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We've established supy(x) <= infy(z)
- But for the horizontal constraint, we've already noted that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which means supx(x) <= supx(z). So, for supx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), which is only possible if infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z). This is a very restrictive condition and is unlikely. So, I don't think x SE z is a general possibility.

Actually, considering this geometric constraint and thinking about cardinal direction relations, the possible relations should be SW, S, and maybe even W if x's vertical extent overlaps with z (which is possible if only a part of x is within y's vertical extent, and the rest extends above y, potentially overlapping with z vertically).

Let me redo the analysis from the beginning, being very precise about the constraints:

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): x is entirely to the left of y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y): x's vertical extent is within y's vertical extent.

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z): y is entirely below z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z): y's horizontal extent is within z's horizontal extent.

Combining these direct constraints, I get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but this doesn't give a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z). This means the top of x is below the bottom of z, or in other words, x is below z.

Now let's see what the above constraints tell us about the nine possible cardinal relationships between x and z:

1. x B z (x bounding box z): For this, we need infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts our finding that supy(x) <= infy(z). So this is not possible.

2. x S z (x south of z): For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), which we've established. We also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). These additional constraints aren't guaranteed by our given conditions, but they are possible. So x S z is a possibility.

3. x SW z (x southwest of z): For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've established supy(x) <= infy(z). For the horizontal constraint, we've noted that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). Both these can be true if infx(z) = infx(y), and in that case, supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x SW z is a possibility.

4. x W z (x west of z): For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), which, as discussed, is possible. But we also need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), as we've established, the constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) leads to a contradiction: infy(z) <= infy(x) => supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). This means supy(x) <= infy(x), which isn't generally true. So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z (x northwest of z): For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But, I've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). For supy(z) <= infy(x) to be true, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x) => supy(z) <= infy(x) => supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z). But this is a restrictive condition requiring infy(z) = supy(z), which is unlikely. So, x NW z is not a general possibility.

6. x N z (x north of z): For this, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). As discussed in the NW case, this is not compatible with our established constraint supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x N z is not possible.

7. x NE z (x northeast of z): Following similar logic as before, this is not possible due to the vertical constraint.

8. x E z (x east of z): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), but we can derive supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which implies supx(x) <= supx(z). For supx(z) <= infx(x) to be true along with supx(x) <= supx(z), we would need infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z), which is restrictive. So, x E z is not a general possibility.

9. x SE z (x southeast of z): This has a horizontal constraint similar to the E case, which makes it not generally possible.

So, after this analysis, I believe the possible relations between x and z are:
- S: If x is horizontally within z's extent but below it.
- SW: If x is to the left of z and below it.

But let me check the conditions for SE more carefully. 

For x SE z:
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We've established supy(x) <= infy(z)
- For the horizontal constraint, we don't have a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). Can it be the case that supx(z) <= infx(x)?

We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z), and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(z) <= infx(x) => supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), using the constraint that infx(x) <= supx(x).

But we can derive supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which implies supx(x) <= supx(z). So, for supx(z) <= supx(x) to be true along with supx(x) <= supx(z), we would need supx(x) = supx(z).

Actually, I think I'm making this more complicated than necessary. Let's visualize the setup:

1. x is W of y: This means x is to the left of y, with its vertical extent (bottom to top) contained within y's vertical extent.
2. y is S of z: This means y is below z, with its horizontal extent (left to right) contained within z's horizontal extent.

Given these, x is to the left of y, which is below z. and y is horizontally contained within z. If y is contained in z horizontally, and x is to the left of y, then x is either to the left of z (making it SW of z) or overlaps with z horizontally (making it S of z).

The key is that x is definitely below z due to its vertical relationship with y. And horizontally, x can either be to the left of z (if z doesn't extend that far to the left) or overlap with z (if z extends far enough to the left to include x).

So, the possible relations are SW and S. in fact, I don't think SE is possible, given that x is to the left of y and y is horizontally contained within z. No region can be east of y and still be southwest of z.

In conclusion, the possible cardinal relations between x and z, if x is W of y and y is S of z, would be SW and S.

Actually, I think we need to consider the multi-part cardinal relationships, which are expressed as "R1 : ... : Rk", but I think the instructions are just asking for the individual tiles, where R_i belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's reaffirm our answer:

1. We know x is W of y, which means:
   - x is entirely to the left of y
   - x's vertical extent is within y's vertical extent

2. We know y is S of z, which means:
   - y is entirely below z
   - y's horizontal extent is within z's horizontal extent

Given these constraints, we can infer:
- x is definitely below z (because x is within y's vertical extent, and y is below z)
- Horizontally, x can be to the left of z's bounding box, or x can horizontally overlap with z's bounding box 

With these constraints, x can be either:
- SW of z (if x is to the left of z)
- S of z (if x horizontally overlaps with z)

So, the possible relations between x and z are SW and S.

In some extreme case, x can be exactly at the southwest corner of z, which would make it both S and SW of z. But the instructions seem to be asking about the individual cardinal directions.

So I think the possible relations between x and z are :
- S
- SW

Now, I need to add a quick check for a more complex case - can x be "SW:S" of z? In our framework, this would mean part of x is SW of z, and another part is S of z. This seems possible, but again, I think we are looking for the atomic directions.

Oh, actually I realized what I said above about the extreme could not happen. If x is at the southwest corner of z, it would be just SW of z, not S of z. To be considered S of z, x would need to have at least some part horizontally within z's extent.

So I still think the possible relations between x and z are :
- S
- SW
I'm confident that this is the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check once more. Given:

- x is W of y
- y is S of z

My intuition is that x could be in the southwest region of z, or in the south region of z. It can't be in the southeast region because x is to the west of y and y is already within the horizontal extent of z.

However, I'm wondering if there are other possibilities I'm missing.

For instance, could x be in the west region of z? For x to be W of z, it would need to be to the left of z and vertically overlapping with z. But given that y is below z, and x is vertically contained within y, it's clear that x is also below z. So x can't be in the west region of z.

Could x be diagonally split, partly in the southwest and partly in the west regions of z? For this to happen, x would need to vertically straddle the boundary between the south and middle tiers of z. Specifically, x's top would need to be above the infy(z). But given that supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we ensure that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. So it can't be in the west region, even partially.

Could x be diagonally split into the south and southeast regions of z? For this to happen, x would need to horizontally straddle the boundary between the middle and right tiers of z. But given that x is to the west of y, which is horizontally contained within z, it's not possible for x to be on the right side of z.

Given the atomicity of our directions, and the fact that "SW:S" is not one of the options, the possible atomic directions are:

- S
- SW

This is my final answer. The possible relations between x and z, given that x is W of y and y is S of z, are:

1. S (if x is horizontally within z's extent but below it)
2. SW (if x is to the left of z and below it)

Actually, let's triple check just in case. 

The cardinal direction relations are defined using the bounds of the region, and we don't have many direct constraints. Let's enumerate all of the constraints and see. 

x W y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

y S z means:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, what can we infer about the relationship between x and z?

Horizontally:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)
But these don't allow us to directly constrain the relationship between x and z horizontally. if we knew supx(x) <= infx(z), then x would be strictly to the left of z. But comparing supx(x) and infx(z), we get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
But this doesn't give us a direct relationship. supx(x) and infx(z) could be in any order relative to each other.

So, horizontally, x and z could be in various configurations:
- x can be entirely to the left of z (if supx(x) <= infx(z))
- x can horizontally overlap with z (if infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z))
- x can be entirely to the right of z (if supx(z) <= infx(x))

Vertically:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)
From these, we can infer:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
So, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is vertically below z. This constrains the vertical relationship between x and z.

Given the vertical constraint, x can only be in the Bottom tier of z (in terms of the 9 tiles around z).

So, given that x is vertically below z, and horizontally, it can be in various positions relative to z, the possible cardinal directions are:
- SW (if x is horizontally to the left of z)
- S (if x horizontally overlaps with z)
- SE (if x is horizontally to the right of z)

But is SE really possible?

If x is SE of z, then x is horizontally to the right of z. This means infx(x) >= supx(z). 

From x W y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y).
From y S z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z).

Can supx(z) <= infx(x) hold given these constraints? It would mean:
supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y)

But we also know supx(y) <= supx(z), so:
supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(y)

This would mean supx(y) <= infx(y), which is not generally true as it would imply the region y has zero width.

So, SE doesn't seem possible given the constraints.

I believe the possible cardinal relations between x and z, given that x is W of y and y is S of z, are:
1. S
2. SW

Actually, let me consider some extreme cases:

1. What if supx(y) = infx(y)?
In this extreme case, y would be a vertical line, which is a degenerate region, and seems to go against the spirit of the problem. But even if this was the case, the constraints would give us supy(x) <= infy(z).

2. What if x straddles the boundary between SW and W regions of z?
For x to be partly in the W region, some part of x would need to be vertically overlapping with z. But our derived constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) ensures that x is entirely below z. So, x cannot be in the W region at all, even partially.

3. What if x straddles the boundary between SW and S regions of z?
This is entirely possible. Part of x can be horizontally outside of z (to the left), and another part can be horizontally within z. In this case, x would have a relationship with z that's not purely SW or purely S, but a combination.

4. What if x straddles the boundary between S and SE regions of z?
For this to happen, part of x would need to be to the right of z. But as we've derived:
supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)
supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
So, supx(x) <= supx(z), which means x can't extend to the right of z. Hence, x can't be in the SE region at all, even partially.

I think my conclusion that the possible cardinal relations are SW and S is still valid.

Actually, I just realized I've been overthinking this. There are 9 atomic cardinal directions: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE. The question is asking which of these atomic cardinal relations can hold between x and z.

I've established that:
- x is definitely vertically below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), which means only the south directions are possible.
- Horizontally, x can be to the left of z, or horizontally overlapping with z. But, as I showed, x can't be to the right of z.

So, the possible atomic cardinal relations are:
- SW (if x is horizontally to the left of z)
- S (if x is horizontally overlapping with z)

The only tricky part is if x straddles the boundary between SW and S. But in that case, the relation would be a composite "SW:S", which, as per the given background and atomic options, would not be one of the direct answers.

So, the final answer: Given that x is W of y and y is S of z, the possible atomic cardinal relations between x and z are SW and S.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is S of region z

I need to determine possible relations between x and z.

Let me analyze what these constraints mean:

For x W y:
- x is entirely to the left of y
- x's vertical extent is within y's vertical extent

For y S z:
- y is entirely below z
- y's horizontal extent is within z's horizontal extent

From these constraints, I can determine:
- Since x's vertical extent is within y's, and y is entirely below z, then x must also be entirely below z
- Horizontally, x is to the left of y, while y is horizontally contained within z

This means x can be:
- SW of z (if x is horizontally to the left of z and below it)
- S of z (if x horizontally overlaps with z and is below it)

No other cardinal direction is possible because:
- x cannot be vertically aligned with z (ruling out W)
- x cannot be to the right of z (ruling out SE)
- x is definitely below z (ruling out N, NW, NE, E, B)

The possible relations between x and z are:
SW, S
