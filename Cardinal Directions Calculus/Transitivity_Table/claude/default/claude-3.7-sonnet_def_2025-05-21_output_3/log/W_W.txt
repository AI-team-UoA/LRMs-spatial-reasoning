PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is W (West) of region y and region y is W (West) of region z.

Let's first recall what it means for a region to be W (West) of another:

a W b if and only if:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is completely to the left of b on the x-axis)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) (a's bottom is not below b's bottom)
- supy(a) <= supy(b) (a's top is not above b's top)

So we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is completely to the left of y on the x-axis)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is not below y's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is not above y's top)

And:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom is not below z's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is not above z's top)

Now I need to determine what this tells us about the relationship between x and z.

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z)
Combining these: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This gives us: supx(x) <= infx(z)
So x is completely to the left of z on the x-axis.

For the y-coordinates, we need to consider how the constraints on y relate x and z:

From x W y:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y W z:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's bottom might be above z's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top might be below z's top)

This means x could be in one of these positions relative to z:
- W (West): if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- NW (Northwest): if supy(z) <= infy(x)
- SW (Southwest): if supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let me verify each possibility:

1. x W z: 
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) ✓
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (possible if infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x))
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (possible if supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z))

2. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) ✓
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (possible if supy(z) <= infy(x), although this doesn't directly follow from the given constraints)

3. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) ✓
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (possible if supy(x) <= infy(z), although this doesn't directly follow from the given constraints)

I need to check if NW and SW are actually possible given the constraints.

For x NW z:
We would need supy(z) <= infy(x). 
From the constraints, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

But nothing directly connects supy(z) and infy(x). So NW is possible if supy(z) <= infy(x), which could happen depending on the specific regions, as long as it doesn't contradict our other constraints.

For x SW z:
We would need supy(x) <= infy(z).
From the constraints, we know:
- supy(x) <= supy(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)

But nothing directly connects supy(x) and infy(z). So SW is possible if supy(x) <= infy(z), which could happen depending on the specific regions, as long as it doesn't contradict our other constraints.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let me think step by step.

Given:
- x W y (supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y))
- y W z (supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z))

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (True from transitivity)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From y W z: infy(z) <= infy(y)
From x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x)
Therefore: infy(z) <= infy(x)

From x W y: supy(x) <= supy(y)
From y W z: supy(y) <= supy(z)
Therefore: supy(x) <= supy(z)

So we do have x W z as one possibility.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (True from transitivity)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

But we can't derive supy(z) <= infy(x) from these. In fact, from infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), it's possible that supy(z) > infy(x).

However, if the regions are positioned just right, NW could still be a valid relation. For example, if region y is much taller than region x and z, then x could be NW of z.

Similarly, for x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (True from transitivity)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our constraints:
- supy(x) <= supy(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)

Again, we can't derive supy(x) <= infy(z) from these. But if the regions are positioned correctly, SW could be a valid relation.

Let me consider all possibilities more carefully.

First, we know for sure that x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)).

In terms of the vertical relationship, let's consider all possibilities:

1. If x is vertically aligned with z such that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x W z.

2. If x is above z such that supy(z) <= infy(x), then x NW z.

3. If x is below z such that supy(x) <= infy(z), then x SW z.

Given the constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

The first case (x W z) is definitely possible. 

For the second case (x NW z), we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts our derived constraint infy(x) <= supy(z) (from infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), assuming transitivity). So x NW z is not possible.

Wait, I made a mistake there. The constraint infy(x) <= supy(z) doesn't follow from our given constraints. Let me reconsider.

Actually, there are no constraints that directly connect infy(x) with supy(z) or supy(x) with infy(z). So both NW and SW remain possibilities.

Let me use a concrete example to check. Consider three rectangular regions positioned as follows:
- x: (0,0) to (1,2)
- y: (2,1) to (3,3)
- z: (4,0) to (5,2)

In this example:
- x W y (x is to the left of y, y's bottom is not below x's bottom, x's top is not above y's top)
- y W z (y is to the left of z, z's bottom is not below y's bottom, y's top is not above z's top)
- x W z (x is to the left of z, z's bottom is not below x's bottom, x's top is not above z's top)

So W is certainly a possibility. But could x be NW of z or SW of z while still maintaining x W y and y W z?

For x NW z, x would need to be above z. Let's modify our example:
- x: (0,3) to (1,5)
- y: (2,1) to (3,4)
- z: (4,0) to (5,2)

In this setup:
- x W y still holds (x is to the left of y, y's bottom (1) is not below x's bottom (3), x's top (5) is not above y's top (4))
- y W z still holds (y is to the left of z, z's bottom (0) is not below y's bottom (1), y's top (4) is not above z's top (2))
- x NW z now holds (x is to the left of z and x is above z)

So NW is also a possibility.

Similarly, for x SW z, x would need to be below z. Let's adjust our example:
- x: (0,0) to (1,2)
- y: (2,1) to (3,4)
- z: (4,3) to (5,5)

In this setup:
- x W y still holds (x is to the left of y, y's bottom (1) is not below x's bottom (0), x's top (2) is not above y's top (4))
- y W z still holds (y is to the left of z, z's bottom (3) is not below y's bottom (1), y's top (4) is not above z's top (5))
- x SW z now holds (x is to the left of z and x is below z)

So SW is also a possibility.

As I've shown with these examples, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW, given that x W y and y W z.

To summarize, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- W (West)
- NW (Northwest)
- SW (Southwest)

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- region x is W of region y
- region y is W of region z

Let me analyze what this means:

When x is W of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (vertical constraint)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (vertical constraint)

When y is W of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (vertical constraint)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (vertical constraint)

From these conditions, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z)

The possible relations between x and z are:
- W (if x and z have overlapping vertical extents)
- NW (if x is above z)
- SW (if x is below z)

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: W, NW, SW
