PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step:

1. Region x is NW of region y: This means that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x). In other words, x is completely to the left of y and completely above y.

2. Region y is N of region z: This means that supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z). In other words, y is completely above z, and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

First, let's think about the vertical relationship (North-South axis):
- x is above y (because x is NW of y)
- y is above z (because y is N of z)
- Therefore, x is definitely above z. This contributes the "N" component to the cardinal direction.

Next, let's think about the horizontal relationship (East-West axis):
- x is to the left of y (because x is NW of y)
- The horizontal relationship between y and z is constrained such that infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z). This means that y's x-projection is within z's x-projection, or in simpler terms, y is not necessarily to the left or right of z; it could be aligned vertically with a part of z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the horizontal relationship between x and z?

Since x is to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)), and z could extend further left than y (infx(z) ≤ infx(y)), there are a few possibilities:
1. x is completely to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)). This would make x NW of z.
2. x and z overlap horizontally, but x is still to the north of z. This would make x N of z.
3. z is completely to the left of x (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)). This would make x NE of z.

However, the third possibility contradicts our given constraints. Let's check: If z is completely to the left of x, then supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we know that supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y). So we have:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Which means supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This doesn't necessarily contradict supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but it would require that supx(x) = supx(z) = infx(x), which is a degenerate case where x has zero width. Since regions are supposed to be homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, this degeneracy isn't allowed.

So, the third possibility (x is NE of z) is not valid.

Let's revisit the horizontal relationship more carefully. Since x is NW of y and y is N of z, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

From these, we can derive:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (given)
2. But we don't know the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). So, x could either be completely to the left of z or horizontally overlap with z.

Let's explore the two valid possibilities:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is completely to the left of z. Combined with the fact that x is above z, this would make x NW of z.

2. If infx(z) < supx(x), then x and z overlap horizontally. But since we know x is above z, and we're assuming here that they overlap horizontally, this would make x N of z.

So, based on our logical deduction, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- x is NW of z
- x is N of z

But wait, I need to be a bit more careful here. Let's make sure that x and z can't have other cardinal direction relationships:

- x can't be NE of z because, as we've seen, that would lead to a contradiction with our given constraints.
- x can't be E of z because that would require x to be to the right of z, which is inconsistent with the fact that x is to the left of y, and y's x-projection is within z's x-projection.
- x can't be SE of z, S of z, SW of z, W of z, or B of z because all of these would require x to be at least partly below z, which contradicts our deduction that x is above z.

So, after a more thorough check, I'm confident that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- x is NW of z
- x is N of z

Actually, I realize I made an error. Let me be more precise:

The constraint "y is N of z" means that supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

The constraint "x is NW of y" means that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

From these, we can derive the relationship between x and z. Let's do it more carefully:

Vertical relationship (North-South):
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is N of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is NW of y)
Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
So, supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is to the north of z.

Horizontal relationship (East-West):
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is NW of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is N of z)

From these, it's clear that x is to the left of y, but the relationship between x and z horizontally is not straightforward. Let's analyze the possible cases:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is completely to the west of z.
2. If infx(z) < supx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x and z overlap horizontally, but x doesn't extend to the right of z.
3. If supx(z) < supx(x), then x extends to the right of z.

Let's check each case to see if it's possible given our constraints:

Case 1: This is clearly possible.

Case 2: This is also possible. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y), then x and z overlap horizontally, but the constraint supx(y) <= supx(z) doesn't impose any further restriction on supx(x) in relation to supx(z).

Case 3: Here's where we need to be careful. We know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). So, supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). Which means supx(x) <= supx(z). This contradicts the assumption supx(z) < supx(x) in case 3.

So, case 3 is not possible.

Now, let's translate these to cardinal directions.

Since x is always to the north of z, and then horizontally it can either be completely to the west of z or overlap with z but not extend to the right of z, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x is NW of z (case 1)
- x is N of z (case 2)

So, my final answer is that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW and N.

Hmm, I think I need to rethink this from scratch. I'm being careless in some of the inferences. Let's take another approach.

For a region a to be NW of a region b, we need:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is to the left of b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is above b)

For a region a to be N of a region b, we need:
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is above b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) (a's x-projection is contained within b's x-projection)

Now, if x is NW of y and y is N of z, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

From these, we can say with certainty:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x). Thus, x is above z.

Now, for the horizontal relationship:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of z is to the left of or at the same position as the left boundary of y)

From these, we cannot say with certainty whether x is completely to the left of z, or if x and z overlap horizontally. But, we do know that x doesn't extend to the right of y, and z doesn't necessarily extend to the left of y.

If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is completely to the left of z, making the relation NW.
But we can't say this for sure based on the given constraints. It might be the case, or it might not.

Similarly, if x and z have overlapping x-projections (i.e., infx(z) <= supx(x)), given that x is above z, the relation would be N.

And for the relation to be NE, we'd need z to be completely to the left of x, which means supx(z) <= infx(x). However, from our premises, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of y is to the left of or at the same position as the right boundary of z)
Thus, supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which means supx(x) <= supx(z). This contradicts the requirement for x to be NE of z, which is supx(z) <= infx(x). So, NE is not a possible relation.

Given the constraints, the regions x, y, and z can be arranged in a way that makes x NW of z, or in another way that makes x N of z. But the relation NE between x and z is not possible.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW and N.

Actually, let me be more careful in checking. Could the relationship also be W, B, or some other relations?

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection)

We already know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for a W relation. So, W is not possible.

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is bounded by z)

Again, this contradicts our known constraint supy(z) <= infy(x). So, B is not possible.

Similarly, for the relations S, SE, E, SW:
- They all require x to be at least partly below z, which contradicts our finding that x is above z.

For NE, as we've already checked, it would require z to be completely to the left of x, which contradicts our derivation.

So, after a thorough check, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are only NW and N.

Actually, I want to explore if it's possible for x to be completely to the right of z, i.e., if a relation like NE is possible.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

We already know that supy(z) <= infy(x), so the second condition is satisfied.

For the first condition, we need to check if supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible given our constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

From these, we can derive: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
This gives us supx(x) <= supx(z).

If we assume supx(z) <= infx(x) (for NE relation), then combining with supx(x) <= supx(z), we get:
supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)

This implies supx(x) = supx(z) = infx(x), which is a contradiction because a region cannot have a zero-width projection.

So, NE is not a possible relation between x and z.

Let's now check if it's possible for x to overlap horizontally with z, making it a N relation.

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

We already know that supy(z) <= infy(x), satisfying the first condition.

For the second condition:
- infx(z) <= infx(x): This is possible. There's no restriction from our premises that prevents z from extending to the left of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): This is already derived from our constraints: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).

So, N is a possible relation.

Let's now check if x can be NW of z.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

We already know that supy(z) <= infy(x), satisfying the second condition.

For the first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), we need to check if this is possible given our constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left boundary of z is to the left of or at the same position as the left boundary of y)

From these, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

However, if we arrange the regions such that infx(z) = infx(y), then we have supx(x) <= infx(y) = infx(z), which satisfies the condition for NW. So, NW is a possible relation.

Based on this analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW and N.

Let me do a check for completeness just to make sure I haven't missed any other possibilities.

Let's list out all the cardinal direction relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.

For convenience, let's refer to the conditions we derived from the original constraints:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right boundary of z)

With these, we can check each cardinal direction:

1. N: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) is not a constraint from our original premises, so it's possible.
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) is derived from our original constraints.
   So, N is a possible relation.

2. NE: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) would imply supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction.
   So, NE is not possible.

3. E: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) leads to a contradiction as shown for NE.
   So, E is not possible.

4. SE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) leads to a contradiction.
   So, SE is not possible.

5. S: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, S is not possible.

6. SW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, SW is not possible.

7. W: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts our derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, W is not possible.

8. NW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible as we've seen earlier.
   So, NW is a possible relation.

9. B: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts our derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, B is not possible.

Based on this exhaustive check, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are only NW and N.

Actually, I just realized there's a flaw in my reasoning. Let me reconsider the horizontal relationships more precisely.

If x is NW of y and y is N of z, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

For the horizontal relationship between x and z, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)

From these, we cannot directly deduce the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). If infx(z) is to the left of supx(x), then x and z would horizontally overlap. If infx(z) is to the right of supx(x), then x would be entirely to the left of z.

Another derived fact is:
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)

However, this doesn't directly constrain the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

Given these constraints, it might be possible for x to horizontally overlap with z in such a way that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), making x N of z, or it might be that supx(x) <= infx(z), making x NW of z.

It might even be possible for x to extend to the right of z, i.e., supx(z) <= supx(x). This would happen if supx(x) is greater than supx(z), which is not disallowed by our constraints.

If x extends to the right of z and is above z, then x would be either NE of z (if infx(x) > supx(z)) or a combination like N:NE of z (if infx(x) <= supx(z) < supx(x)).

But hold on, I think there's a subtle point we've missed. For a single-tile cardinal direction relation, the regions should not overlap in the sense that they're disjoint (except at the boundaries in some cases). Let me clarify this...

Actually, the definitions given for the cardinal directions ensure that the regions are disjoint (or touch at the boundaries). For example, for x to be N of z, it means supy(z) <= infy(x), which ensures that z is below x with no vertical overlap.

So, based on the constraints from x NW y and y N z, the horizontal relationship between x and z could be one of three possibilities:
1. x is completely to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. z extends to the left of x, and x extends to the right of z: infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) <= supx(x)
3. x is completely to the right of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)

For the first possibility, we get the relation as NW.
For the second, since x is also above z, the relation would be a composite of N and NE, which is not a single-tile relation.
For the third, we get the relation as NE.

Let's check if the third possibility (NE) is even feasible:

If x is NW of y and y is N of z, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)

Combining these, we get: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
This implies supx(x) <= supx(z).

If x is NE of z, we'd have supx(z) <= infx(x). Together with supx(x) <= supx(z), this would give supx(x) = supx(z) = infx(x), which is a contradiction because it would make x have a zero-width projection on the x-axis.

So, the third possibility (NE) is not feasible.

For the second possibility, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) <= supx(x).
But from our constraints, we've shown that supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= supx(x). So, the second possibility is also not feasible.

This leaves us with just the first possibility, which gives the relation NW.

But wait, I think I misunderstood something. Let me clarify:

A cardinal direction relation specifies how one region is located in relation to another, and regions can have complex shapes. It might be possible for a region x to be north of region z for part of z and northwest of region z for another part.

Let's be careful and revisit the cardinal directions more precisely:

- A region x is N of region z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- A region x is NW of region z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

If x is NW of y and y is N of z, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This ensures that x is above z.

For the horizontal relationship, if x is completely to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)), then x is NW of z.

But what if x and z horizontally overlap? That is, what if infx(z) <= supx(x)?

From our premises, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This means supx(x) and infx(z) are both less than or equal to infx(y). But these by themselves don't tell us the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

It's possible that infx(z) <= supx(x), which means x and z horizontally overlap. However, for x to be N of z, we also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

Let's check if these conditions can be satisfied simultaneously:

- From x NW y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y).
- From y N z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

We are checking if it's possible that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

There's nothing in our constraints that prevents infx(z) <= infx(x).

For supx(x) <= supx(z), we had derived earlier that supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). So, supx(x) <= supx(z) is indeed true.

So, it's possible for x to be N of z as well, if infx(z) <= infx(x).

Therefore, based on the constraints that x is NW of y and y is N of z, the possible relations between x and z are NW and N.

Just to recap:

If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is NW of z.
If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is N of z. We've shown that supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true, so the condition simplifies to infx(z) <= infx(x).

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW and N.

I think I need to say that in more simple language. Let's double check our work from scratch one more time.

When checking the possible relation(s) between x and z, I need to examine all the 9 possibilities: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B.

Given that x is NW of y and y is N of z, I can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is above z on the y-axis.
- The horizontal relationship between x and z is not straightforward, but I derived supx(x) <= supx(z).

Let's check each possible relation:

1. N: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): Yes, derived.
   - infx(z) <= infx(x): This isn't directly derivable from the premises, but it's possible. For example, if infx(z) = infx(x), this condition would be satisfied.
   - supx(x) <= supx(z): Yes, derived.
   So, N is a possible relation between x and z.

2. NE: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): Yes, derived.
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): This, along with our derived condition supx(x) <= supx(z), would imply supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction since a region's projection can't have zero width.
   So, NE is not a possible relation.

3. E: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): This leads to a contradiction as shown for NE.
   So, E is not a possible relation.

4. SE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): This leads to a contradiction as shown for NE.
   So, SE is not a possible relation.

5. S: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): This contradicts our derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, S is not a possible relation.

6. SW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): This contradicts our derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x).
   So, SW is not a possible relation.

7. W: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - infy(z) <= infy(x): This, along with our derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x), implies infy(z) <= supy(z), which is always true for any non-empty region. So this is possible.
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): This is possible (if x is completely to the left of z).
   - supy(x) <= supy(z): Wait, this might not be possible because we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y) and supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z). Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). So, supy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, W is not a possible relation.

8. NW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): Yes, derived.
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): This is possible (if x is completely to the left of z).
   So, NW is a possible relation.

9. B: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - supy(x) <= supy(z): As shown for W, this is not possible given our constraints.
   So, B is not a possible relation.

Ok I believe this is the correct derivation now. Based on this analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW and N.

I realize I'm still being a bit hasty in my checking. We wouldn't immediately dismiss the possibility of W. Let me re-examine the condition that x is W of z.

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection)

We already know that supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z). However, for W, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which would imply supy(x) = supy(z) = infy(x). This is a contradiction for a region with non-zero height. Hence, W is not a possible relation.

Similarly, for B, SE, S, SW, E, and NE, the key point is that these relations are either ruled out by the fact that x is above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)) or by other constraints derived from x NW y and y N z.

Therefore, the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW and N.

Actually, I think I'm oversimplificating the reasoning by providing intuitive explanations that don't map to precise conditions. Let me make these checks more explicit.

1. N: For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) is derivable from the original constraints: supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z) and infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y). So supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We also derived that supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - The missing piece is infx(z) <= infx(x).

2. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) is derived as shown above.
   - The additional condition is supx(x) <= infx(z).

Now, let's think about the possible arrangements of these regions. The constraints supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) don't directly determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). It's possible for supx(x) < infx(z) (making x NW of z), or for infx(z) < supx(x) (allowing for other relations).

Similarly, there's no direct constraint on the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x).

But here's my issue: Darn it, I think I keep making errors. Let me attempt a cleaner slate for the final time.

Given:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, I can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is above z.
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z).

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (Already derived; x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (This is an open question)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (Already derived)

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (This is another open question)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (Already derived; x is above z)

Here's the key: the constraints we have don't definitively tell us either infx(z) <= infx(x) or supx(x) <= infx(z). Both could be true depending on the specific arrangement of the regions.

For instance, I can arrange the regions to get either of these two relations:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is NW of z.
2. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is N of z. We've already shown supx(x) <= supx(z), so the condition simplifies to infx(z) <= infx(x).

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW and N.

The key is to understand that the original constraints don't uniquely determine the arrangement of x, y, and z. They allow for multiple arrangements, and depending on the specific arrangement, x can be either NW or N of z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW and N.

Great, so N and NW.

Actually, let me try once again using a more systematic approach. Let me go through all cardinal direction relations and check if they can be satisfied given the constraints:

1. N: For x to be N of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): From our derivation, supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x). ✓
   - infx(z) <= infx(x): This isn't directly derivable from the given constraints. It can be true in certain arrangements. ✓
   - supx(x) <= supx(z): From our derivation, supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). Thus, supx(x) <= supx(z). ✓

   Given that these conditions can be simultaneously satisfied, N is a possible relation.

2. NE: For x to be NE of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): This is satisfied as shown in the N check. ✓
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): Earlier, we derived supx(x) <= supx(z). This, along with supx(z) <= infx(x), would imply supx(x) <= infx(x), which contradicts the nature of regions (they can't have zero width). ✗

   Given the contradiction, NE is not a possible relation.

3. E: For x to be E of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): As shown in the NE check, this leads to a contradiction. ✗
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z): We won't check these since the first condition isn't satisfied.

   Given the contradiction, E is not a possible relation.

4. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): As shown in the NE check, this leads to a contradiction. ✗
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): We won't check this since the first condition isn't satisfied.

   Given the contradiction, SE is not a possible relation.

5. S: For x to be S of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): This contradicts our derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x), because for both to be true, we'd have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which implies supy(x) = infy(z) = supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). This would make the regions have zero height. ✗

   Given the contradiction, S is not a possible relation.

6. SW: For x to be SW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): This is possible. ✓
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): As shown in the S check, this leads to a contradiction. ✗

   Given the contradiction, SW is not a possible relation.

7. W: For x to be W of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): This is possible. ✓
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z): For both to be true, we'd have infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which is normal for regions. However, we've derived supy(z) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). ✗

   Given the contradiction, W is not a possible relation.

8. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): This isn't directly derivable from the given constraints. It can be true in certain arrangements. ✓
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): This is satisfied as shown in the N check. ✓

   Given that these conditions can be simultaneously satisfied, NW is a possible relation.

9. B: For x to be B of z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z): We've derived supy(z) <= infy(x). This means supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). ✗

   Given the contradiction, B is not a possible relation.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are N and NW.

So, my final answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are N and NW.

ANSWER:

The cardinal directions "NW of" and "N of" describe specific spatial relationships between regions. I need to determine what's possible when we have these constraints:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the definitions:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For the possible relations between x and z:

1. N: Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - We've shown supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) are true
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is possible in some arrangements

2. NW: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We've shown supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is true
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible in some arrangements

The answer is: N, NW
