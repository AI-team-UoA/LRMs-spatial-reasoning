PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step. 

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of the cardinal directions:

For region x is N of region y (x N y):
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

For region y is NW of region z (y NW z):
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, let's try to derive the relation between x and z.

From x N y, we know:
1. supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y NW z, we know:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z)
5. supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's see if we can infer anything about the relation between x and z:

From (1) and (5), we get:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
This means supy(z) <= infy(x), which is one of the conditions for x to be N, NE, or NW of z.

From (3) and (4), we get:
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This means supx(x) <= infx(z), which is one of the conditions for x to be NW, W, or SW of z.

So, x could be NW of z.

Let's also check if there are other possible relations:

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied from the above)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

But from (3) and (4), we have supx(x) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= supx(z) (since infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region z). However, we don't know if infx(z) <= infx(x). So, we can't determine if x can be N of z.

Actually, let's reason a bit more carefully. From (3) and (4), we know supx(x) <= infx(z). This means there's a horizontal gap between x and z, with x being to the left of z. This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) required for x to be N of z. So, x cannot be N of z.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied from the above)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

From (3) and (4), we have supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (since infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region z). So, x cannot be NE of z.

Actually, I made a mistake above. From (3) and (4), we know:
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

This gives us supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This is a condition for x to be NW, W, or SW of z. But we also know from (1) and (5) that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is above z. This is a condition for x to be N, NE, or NW of z.

Combining these, x can only be NW of z.

But actually, let me double-check this. Let's verify whether the constraints we have are sufficient to determine that x can only be NW of z.

From x N y, we have:
1. supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y NW z, we have:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z)
5. supy(z) <= infy(y)

From (1) and (5), we get:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
This means supy(z) <= infy(x), which indicates x is above z.

From (3) and (4), we get:
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This means supx(x) <= infx(z), which indicates x is to the left of z.

Given that x is above z and to the left of z, x can only be NW of z.

Actually, I want to make sure I haven't overlooked anything.

Let's consider all the possible cardinal directions one by one and check if they are consistent with the constraints we've derived.

1. x N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

2. x NE z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)

   From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= supx(z). But this doesn't guarantee that supx(z) <= infx(x). In fact, since infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region z, and we know supx(x) <= infx(z), we can't have supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

3. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x cannot be E of z.

4. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SE of z.

5. x S z:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

6. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

8. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)

   Both conditions are satisfied, so x can be NW of z.

9. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

So, it seems like the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

However, there's a logical flaw in my reasoning above. Let's re-analyze with a clearer approach.

From the given conditions, we've established two key constraints:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x)
2. supx(x) <= infx(z)

Constraint 1 indicates that x is above z, which means x could be N, NE, or NW of z.
Constraint 2 indicates that x is to the left of z, which means x could be NW, W, or SW of z.

Combining these, the only common relation is NW. So, x can be NW of z.

But wait, there's more to consider. Our constraints don't completely specify the positions of x, y, and z. There might be other configurations that satisfy the given conditions.

Let's think about the two constraints:
1. x N y: This means region x is directly above region y.
2. y NW z: This means region y is to the northwest of region z.

From these, we can infer that region x is to the north of a region that is to the northwest of region z. This suggests that x is somewhere in the northern direction of z, but the exact cardinal direction depends on the relative positions of x, y, and z.

Actually, let's be even more precise. 

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is at least partly aligned with y along the x-axis)

From y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- We know that infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

The last constraint implies that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

So, x is above z and to the left of z. This corresponds to the cardinal direction NW. Therefore, x is NW of z.

But wait, let's consider different scenarios:

Scenario 1: y is far to the west of z, and x is far to the east of y (but still north of y). In this case, x might be N or NE of z.

Scenario 2: y is far to the north of z, and x is slightly north but mostly east of y. In this case, x might be NE or E of z.

Let's revisit the constraints and try to be more precise.

Let's re-estimate the bounds on the coordinates.

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (which implies supy(z) <= infy(x))
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (which implies supx(x) <= infx(z))

We know that supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z) and supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z). This perfectly defines the NW direction.

But actually, let's think about this a bit more carefully.

I think there there might be a complication I've been missing. If x is N of y, then x is directly above y, but there's no constraint on how far x is above y. Similarly, if y is NW of z, then y is to the northwest of z, but there's no constraint on how far y is to the northwest of z.

Let's reconsider the constraints:

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is at least partly aligned with y along the x-axis)

From y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (which implies supy(z) <= infy(x))
- We know that infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

The last constraint implies that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

So, we have established that supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z) and supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z). This means x is to the northwest of z.

However, consider a case where y is far to the northwest of z, and x is directly above y. In this case, x would still be to the northwest of z.

In fact, if we consider the definitions of the cardinal directions, the only constraint we have is that x is to the northwest of z. Therefore, the possible relation between x and z is NW.

But wait, actually I think I might be making an error. The conditions I've been using, like supx(x) <= infx(z), only constrain one part of the relation. Let's re-examine the cardinal directions.

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (which implies supy(z) <= infy(x))
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (which implies supx(x) <= infx(z))

Now, let's check which cardinal directions these constraints are compatible with:

1. x N z:
   - Constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - Our derived constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   From supx(x) <= infx(z), we can infer that supx(x) <= supx(z) (since infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region z). However, there's a contradiction because if supx(x) <= infx(z), then it's not possible to have infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

Actually, that's not necessarily true. Let me reconsider.

If supx(x) <= infx(z), this means the right boundary of x is to the left of the left boundary of z. But this doesn't automatically contradict infx(z) <= infx(x). If infx(x) is even further to the left than infx(z), then both supx(x) <= infx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) could be satisfied. But then this means that supx(x) < infx(x), and that's not possible for any region x (the right boundary is always to the right of or at the same position as the left boundary).

So, x cannot be N of z.

2. x NE z:
   - Constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - Our derived constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   Since supx(x) <= infx(z), and given that infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region z, it's not possible to have supx(z) <= infx(x). There's a contradiction. So, x cannot be NE of z.

3. x E z:
   - Constraints: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - Our derived constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   Since supy(z) <= infy(x), and given that infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region x, it's not possible to have supy(x) <= supy(z). There's a contradiction. So, x cannot be E of z.

4. x SE z:
   - Constraints: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - Our derived constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   Since supy(z) <= infy(x), and given that infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region x, it's not possible to have supy(x) <= infy(z). There's a contradiction. So, x cannot be SE of z.

5. x S z:
   - Constraints: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - Our derived constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   Since supy(z) <= infy(x), and given that infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region x, it's not possible to have supy(x) <= infy(z). There's a contradiction. So, x cannot be S of z.

6. x SW z:
   - Constraints: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - Our derived constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   Since supy(z) <= infy(x), and given that infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region x, it's not possible to have supy(x) <= infy(z). There's a contradiction. So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. x W z:
   - Constraints: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - Our derived constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   Since supy(z) <= infy(x), we have that infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
   
   However, since supy(z) <= infy(x), and given that infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region x, it's not possible to have supy(x) <= supy(z). There's a contradiction.

   So, x cannot be W of z.

8. x NW z:
   - Constraints: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - Our derived constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   Both conditions are satisfied. So, x can be NW of z.

9. x B z:
   - Constraints: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - Our derived constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x), supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   Since supx(x) <= infx(z), and given that infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region z, we have supx(x) <= supx(z). However, if supx(x) <= infx(z), it's not possible to have infx(z) <= infx(x). There's a contradiction. So, x cannot be B of z.

Alright it seems NW is the only possibility. But let's double check by trying to find a way to satisfy some of the other directions.

Let's consider N. For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which is one of the conditions. However, we also know supx(x) <= infx(z), which means the right boundary of x is to the left of the left boundary of z. This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x), which means the left boundary of z is to the left of the left boundary of x. So, x cannot be N of z.

Let's consider NE. For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which is one of the conditions. However, we also know supx(x) <= infx(z), which means the right boundary of x is to the left of the left boundary of z. This contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x), which means the right boundary of z is to the left of the left boundary of x. So, x cannot be NE of z.

Let's try to find a possible geographic arrangement. Given:
- x is N of y
- y is NW of z

We know:
- x is directly above y
- y is to the northwest of z

What if y is to the left of z, but x is to the right of y? Could x be to the left, right, or directly above z? Let's check.

If y is to the left of z, then supx(y) <= infx(z).
If x is to the right of y, then supx(y) >= infx(x). This doesn't contradict the condition for x N y, which requires infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).

However, if x is to the right of y and y is to the left of z, then x can still be to the left of z. This is consistent with our derived constraint supx(x) <= infx(z).

So, it seems like x can only be NW of z.

Wait, I realize that I might have been making a logical error. Let me start from scratch to verify the result.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

For region x is N of region y (x N y), we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) [x is at least partly aligned with y along the x-axis]

For region y is NW of region z (y NW z), we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is above z]

From the above, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) [which implies supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is above z]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [which implies supx(x) <= infx(z), meaning x is to the left of z]

Let's check these constraints for each possible relation:

1. x N z:
   - Constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x) [check], infx(z) <= infx(x) [?], supx(x) <= supx(z) [?]
   - We know supx(x) <= infx(z). Given that infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region z, we have supx(x) <= supx(z). But for N, we also need infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) for any valid regions x and z. So, x cannot be N of z.

2. x NE z:
   - Constraints: supy(z) <= infy(x) [check], supx(z) <= infx(x) [?]
   - We know supx(x) <= infx(z). Given that infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region z, and since supx(z) <= infx(x) is required for NE, we have infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). But this contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) for any valid regions x and z. So, x cannot be NE of z.

3. x E z:
   - Constraints: supx(z) <= infx(x) [?], infy(z) <= infy(x) [?], supy(x) <= supy(z) [?]
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) for any valid regions x and z. So, x cannot be E of z.

4. x SE z:
   - Constraints: supx(z) <= infx(x) [?], supy(x) <= infy(z) [?]
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for any valid regions x and z. So, x cannot be SE of z.

5. x S z:
   - Constraints: supy(x) <= infy(z) [?], infx(z) <= infx(x) [?], supx(x) <= supx(z) [?]
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for any valid regions x and z. So, x cannot be S of z.

6. x SW z:
   - Constraints: supx(x) <= infx(z) [check], supy(x) <= infy(z) [?]
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for any valid regions x and z. So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. x W z:
   - Constraints: supx(x) <= infx(z) [check], infy(z) <= infy(x) [?], supy(x) <= supy(z) [?]
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). So, infy(z) <= infy(x) [check]. But, supy(z) <= infy(x) also implies supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) (since infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

8. x NW z:
   - Constraints: supx(x) <= infx(z) [check], supy(z) <= infy(x) [check]
   - Both conditions are satisfied. So, x can be NW of z.

9. x B z:
   - Constraints: infx(z) <= infx(x) [?], supx(x) <= supx(z) [?], infy(z) <= infy(x) [?], supy(x) <= supy(z) [?]
   - We know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for any valid regions x and z. So, x cannot be B of z.

From the above analysis, it seems like the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

But wait, what if I try to establish some specific coordinate values?

Suppose we have the following coordinates:
y: rectangle from (2, 2) to (4, 4) (i.e., infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4)
z: rectangle from (5, 1) to (7, 2) (i.e., infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2)

It's easy to confirm that y is NW of z:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) = 2 <= infy(y) = 2 [y is above z, actually at the same level]

Now, what if x is N of y? Let's say:
x: rectangle from (3, 5) to (5, 6) (i.e., infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6)

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 [x is above y]
- infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3 [left side ok]
- supx(x) = 5 <= supx(y) = 4 ... this is false!

Actually I made a mistake. Let's redefine x.

x: rectangle from (2, 5) to (4, 6) (i.e., infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6)

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 [x is above y]
- infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2 [left side ok]
- supx(x) = 4 <= supx(y) = 4 [right side ok]

Yes, x is N of y.

Now, what is the relation between x and z?

- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6
- infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2

Let's check:
- supx(x) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 [x is to the left of z]
- supy(z) = 2 <= infy(x) = 5 [x is above z]

So, x is NW of z.

Wait, let me just try another configuration to make to make sure.

Suppose we have:
y: rectangle from (2, 2) to (4, 4) (i.e., infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4)
z: rectangle from (5, 1) to (7, 2) (i.e., infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2)

And what if x is much further to the west than y?
x: rectangle from (0, 5) to (2, 6) (i.e., infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6)

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 [x is above y]
- infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 0 ... this is false!

Hmm, I made a mistake in the condition. For N, the condition is:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

This means x's x-projected interval should be a subset of y's x-projected interval. Let me re-define x.

x: rectangle from (3, 5) to (4, 6) (i.e., infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6)

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 [x is above y]
- infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3 ... hmm, this doesn't match the condition.

Actually, I made a mistake in the formulation. For region x to be N of region y, the condition is:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [right alignment]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [left alignment]

Meaning, the interval [infx(x), supx(x)] is contained within the interval [infx(y), supx(y)]. Let's redefine x again:

x: rectangle from (2.5, 5) to (3.5, 6) (i.e., infx(x) = 2.5, supx(x) = 3.5, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6)

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 [x is above y]
- infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2.5 [right alignment]
- supx(x) = 3.5 <= supx(y) = 4 [left alignment]

Yes, x is N of y.

Now, what is the relation between x and z?

- infx(x) = 2.5, supx(x) = 3.5, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6
- infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2

Let's check:
- supx(x) = 3.5 <= infx(z) = 5 [x is to the left of z]
- supy(z) = 2 <= infy(x) = 5 [x is above z]

So, x is NW of z.

Let's check if x can be N of z:
- supy(z) = 2 <= infy(x) = 5 [check]
- infx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 2.5 ... this is false!

Let's check if x can be NE of z:
- supy(z) = 2 <= infy(x) = 5 [check]
- supx(z) = 7 <= infx(x) = 2.5 ... this is false!

Let me try a different example directly with the NE relation in mind.

Suppose we have:
y: rectangle from (2, 2) to (4, 4) (i.e., infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4)
z: rectangle from (0, 0) to (1, 1) (i.e., infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1)

It's easy to confirm that y is NW of z? Wait, that can't be right. Let's check:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 0 ... this is false!
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 [check]

This doesn't work. For y to be NW of z, y should be to the left of z, not to the right. Let me redefine the coordinates:

y: rectangle from (2, 2) to (4, 4) (i.e., infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4)
z: rectangle from (5, 0) to (7, 1) (i.e., infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1)

Now let's check if y is NW of z:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 [y is above z]

Yes, y is NW of z.

Now, let's say x is N of y:
x: rectangle from (3, 5) to (3.5, 6) (i.e., infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 3.5, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6)

Let's check if x is N of y:
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 [x is above y]
- infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3 [right alignment]
- supx(x) = 3.5 <= supx(y) = 4 [left alignment]

Yes, x is N of y.

Now, is it possible to place x so that it is NE of z?
For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the right of z]

From our coordinates:
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 5 [check]
- supx(z) = 7 <= infx(x) = 3 ... this is false!

This doesn't work. But can we adjust the position of z to make it work?

Let's try a different setup:
y: rectangle from (2, 2) to (4, 4) (i.e., infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4)
z: rectangle from (0, 0) to (1, 1) (i.e., infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1)

Let's check if y is NW of z:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 0 ... this is false!
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 [check]

The problem is z should be to the left of y, not to the right. Let me try again.

Wait, I'm confused. For y to be NW of z, y should be to the left and above z. In other words, from y's perspective, z is to the east and south. So let's try again:

y: rectangle from (2, 2) to (4, 4) (i.e., infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4)
z: rectangle from (5, 0) to (7, 1) (i.e., infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1)

Is y NW of z?
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 [check]
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2 [check]

Yes, y is NW of z.

Now, let's introduce x:
x: rectangle from (3, 5) to (3.5, 6) (i.e., infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 3.5, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6)

Is x N of y?
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 [check]
- infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3 [check]
- supx(x) = 3.5 <= supx(y) = 4 [check]

Yes, x is N of y.

Now, is x NW of z?
- supx(x) = 3.5 <= infx(z) = 5 [check]
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 5 [check]

Yes, x is NW of z.

Wait, but actually, let me try to set up a scenario where x is NE of z.

Given y is NW of z and x is N of y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is above z]
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [right alignment]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [left alignment]

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) [x is above z]
- supx(z) <= infx(x) [x is to the right of z]

From the constraints, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) [which implies supy(z) <= infy(x)]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [which implies supx(x) <= infx(z)]

The first condition for NE is satisfied. But for the second condition, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). However, the constraints tell us supx(x) <= infx(z). Given that infx(z) <= supx(z) for any valid region z, we have supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). This contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for NE. So, x cannot be NE of z.

Actually I think I've been thinking about this incorrectly. For region a to be NW of region b, we should have:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) [a is to the left of b]
- supy(b) <= infy(a) [a is above b]

So for y to be NW of z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [y is above z]

And for x to be N of y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) [x is above y]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) [right alignment]
- supx(x) <= supx(y) [left alignment]

Now, combining these constraints, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) [which implies supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is above z]
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) [which implies supx(x) <= infx(z), meaning x is to the left of z]

Let's check all possible relations:

1. x N z: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) [check], infx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)], supx(x) <= supx(z) [can be true].

2. x NE z: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) [check], supx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)].

3. x E z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)], infy(z) <= infy(x) [can be true], supy(x) <= supy(z) [contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x)].

4. x SE z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)], supy(x) <= infy(z) [contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x)].

5. x S z: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) [contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x)], infx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)], supx(x) <= supx(z) [can be true].

6. x SW z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) [check], supy(x) <= infy(z) [contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x)].

7. x W z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) [check], infy(z) <= infy(x) [can be true], supy(x) <= supy(z) [contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x)].

8. x NW z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) [check], supy(z) <= infy(x) [check]. Both conditions are satisfied.

9. x B z: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)], supx(x) <= supx(z) [can be true], infy(z) <= infy(x) [can be true], supy(x) <= supy(z) [contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x)].

From the above, only NW is consistent with the constraints. So, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Let me put this into a picture, to verify the constraints once more.

Imagine a 2D grid with the x-axis increasing from left to right and the y-axis increasing from bottom to top.

Region y is a rectangle in the middle of the grid. Region z is a rectangle to the right and below y (i.e., y is to the NW of z). And region x is a rectangle directly above y (i.e., x is to the N of y). With this setup, region x is to the NW of region z.

Let's check the constraints:
- For y NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y).
- For x N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).

If we combine these, we get:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x).
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z).

These two constraints together define the NW relation between x and z. So, x is NW of z.

I believe the answer is NW.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

I've analyzed the constraints imposed by these relations and checked all possible relations between x and z. Only NW satisfies all the constraints. The key insight is that if x is directly above y, and y is to the northwest of z, then x must be to the northwest of z.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From x N y, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (left alignment)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (right alignment)

From y NW z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x is above z.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is to the left of z.

When a region is both above and to the left of another region, it is in the NW direction relative to that region.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: NW
