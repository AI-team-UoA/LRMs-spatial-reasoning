PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this step by step to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given information:
- x is E of y, which means y is the reference region, and x is to the East of y
- y is B of z, which means z is the reference region, and y is in the Bounding box of z

First, let's recall what these direction relations mean:

x E y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

y B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now I'll determine the possible relationships between x and z by analyzing the coordinates.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's first consider the x-coordinate constraints:
- From x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y B z: supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these, we have: supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z))
Since supx(y) <= infx(x), we know that infx(x) is greater than or equal to supx(y).
And since supx(y) <= supx(z), we know that supx(z) is greater than or equal to supx(y).

But this doesn't fully constrain the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). There are two possibilities:
1. infx(x) <= supx(z): This means x and z could overlap in their x-coordinate projections
2. supx(z) < infx(x): This means x is strictly to the right of z

For the y-coordinate constraints, we have:
- From x E y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y B z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means that the y-range of x is within the y-range of z.

Now, let's enumerate the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. If infx(x) <= supx(z) (x and z overlap in x-coordinates):
   Since infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), x is within the y-range of z.
   This could correspond to several relations:
   - E (if supx(z) < infx(x))
   - B (if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z))
   - NE (if supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x))
   - SE (if supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z))

2. If supx(z) < infx(x) (x is strictly to the right of z):
   This means x must be either E, NE, or SE of z, depending on the y-coordinate relationship.

Let me analyze further:

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's bottom is lower than or equal to x's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is lower than or equal to y's top)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's left is further left than y's left)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right is further left than z's right)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is lower than y's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is lower than z's top)

Combining the x-coordinate constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

This gives us: infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)
Simplifying: infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

This means that at least part of x is to the right of z (since infx(x) >= supx(y)). But we don't know if x is entirely to the right of z (which would require infx(x) > supx(z)).

Actually, we know from y B z that supx(y) <= supx(z).
And from x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x).

Combined, we have supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)).

There are now two subcases:
1. supx(z) < infx(x): In this case, x is strictly to the east of z.
2. infx(x) <= supx(z): In this case, x and z could overlap in their x-projections.

For the y-coordinates:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (combining infy(z) <= infy(y) from y B z and infy(y) <= infy(x) from x E y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (combining supy(x) <= supy(y) from x E y and supy(y) <= supy(z) from y B z)

From the y-coordinate constraints, it's clear that the vertical extent of x falls within the vertical extent of z. This means x cannot be strictly north or south of z.

Let's enumerate the possible cardinal direction relations:

1. If supx(z) < infx(x) (x is strictly to the right of z):
   Since infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), x is within the y-range of z.
   This would correspond to the E (East) relation.

2. If infx(x) <= supx(z) (x and z overlap in x-coordinates):
   There are several possibilities:
   - If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is completely within the x-range of z.
     Combined with infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), this would make x B (Bounding box) relative to z.
   - If infx(x) = supx(z), then x just touches z on the right edge. Given the y-coordinate constraints,
     x would still be E of z.

Alright, let me make this clearer. Let's visualize the constraints with some simple diagrams.

For x E y:
supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the right of y
infy(y) <= infy(x): x doesn't extend below y
supy(x) <= supy(y): x doesn't extend above y

For y B z:
infx(z) <= infx(y): y doesn't extend to the left of z
supx(y) <= supx(z): y doesn't extend to the right of z
infy(z) <= infy(y): y doesn't extend below z
supy(y) <= supy(z): y doesn't extend above z

Combining these, we can infer:
- x is to the right of y, and y is within the x-range of z. This means x is either to the right of z or partially overlaps with z in the x-coordinate.
- y is within the y-range of z, and x is within the y-range of y. This means x is also within the y-range of z.

The possible cardinal direction relations for x relative to z are:
- E (East): If x is strictly to the right of z and within its y-range.
- B (Bounding box): If x falls within both the x-range and y-range of z.

Actually, I missed some possibilities earlier. Let me be more thorough.

Given:
- x E y
- y B z

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's bottom is lower than or equal to x's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is lower than or equal to y's top)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's left is further left than y's left)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right is not beyond z's right)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is lower than y's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is not above z's top)

For the x-coordinates:
Combining supx(y) <= infx(x) from x E y and supx(y) <= supx(z) from y B z,
we get: supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z))

This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). There are two possibilities:
1. infx(x) <= supx(z): This means x and z could overlap in their x-projections.
2. supx(z) < infx(x): This means x is strictly to the right of z.

For the y-coordinates:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (combining constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (combining constraints)

This means the y-range of x is a subset of the y-range of z.

More specifically, this could lead to several possible configurations:
i) If x is to the right of z (supx(z) < infx(x)), then x is E of z.
ii) If x and z overlap in x-projections (infx(x) <= supx(z)), and if x is completely inside z's x-range (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)), then x is B of z.
iii) If x and z overlap in x-projections, but x extends beyond z's right edge (infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) < supx(x)), then x is neither strictly E nor strictly B of z. In this case, we'd need to consider multi-tile directions.

Actually, I'm missing an important consideration. x is E of y means supx(y) <= infx(x), but this doesn't strictly mean supx(y) < infx(x). It could be the case that supx(y) = infx(x), which means x just touches y at y's right edge.

Similarly, y B z means infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but it doesn't mean infx(z) < infx(y) and supx(y) < supx(z). There could be cases where infx(z) = infx(y) (y touches z at z's left edge) or supx(y) = supx(z) (y touches z at z's right edge).

So, if supx(y) = infx(x) (x touches y at y's right edge) and supx(y) = supx(z) (y touches z at z's right edge), then infx(x) = supx(z), which means x touches z at z's right edge. In this case, x is E of z.

But if supx(y) < supx(z), then even though supx(y) <= infx(x), it's possible that infx(x) <= supx(z), which means x could partially overlap with z in the x-coordinate. Depending on the extent of overlap and the y-coordinate relationship, x could be in multiple directions relative to z.

I need to reconsider the problem from the basic definitions to be more precise.

From the given constraints:
- x E y means:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
  - infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is not below y's bottom)
  - supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is not above y's top)

- y B z means:
  - infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left is not to the left of z's left)
  - supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right is not to the right of z's right)
  - infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom is not below z's bottom)
  - supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is not above z's top)

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is not below z's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is not above z's top)

From the given constraints, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

This means supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)). Now, if supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is strictly to the right of z, which means x could be E of z.

But if infx(x) < supx(z), then x and z have overlapping x-projections. Depending on the exact configuration, x could be partly in z, which would give different cardinal directions.

For the y-coordinates, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is not below z's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (x's top is not above z's top)

This means, for the y-coordinates, x is within the y-range of z.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

1. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is strictly to the right of z. Given the y-coordinate constraints, x is E of z.

2. If infx(x) < supx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is completely within the x-range of z. Given the y-coordinate constraints, x is B of z.

3. If infx(x) < supx(z) but it's not the case that both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x and z have overlapping x-projections, but x is not completely within z's x-range. This could correspond to other cardinal directions or combinations.

Let's think about the third case in more detail. There are two subcases:
a) infx(x) < infx(z): This means x extends to the left of z, which doesn't match any of our known constraints. So, this subcase isn't possible.
b) supx(z) < supx(x): This means x extends to the right of z. Given that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), this could correspond to a composite direction like "B:E" or just "E". But in the defined cardinal direction system, a region can't be in more than one of the nine tiles simultaneously.

Actually, I see the confusion. Let me be more precise. With regions, a region can intersect multiple tiles of the direction relation model. For instance, in the case where x and z have overlapping x-projections and x extends to the right of z, x would intersect both the B (bounding box) tile and the E (east) tile of the direction relation model, resulting in a composite direction "B:E". But the question is about which single cardinal direction relation can hold between x and z.

Let me redefine the problem in a different way. We're given a reference region z, and we want to determine which tile or combination of tiles of z can contain region x, given that x is E of y and y is B of z.

From what we've analyzed so far, region x must satisfy:
- It's vertical extent is within the vertical extent of z: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- It's either strictly to the right of z or partially overlaps with z in the x-coordinate.

Given the constraints, here are the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations:
- E (East): If x is strictly to the right of z.
- B (Bounding box): If x is completely inside the bounds of z.

But if x can be in multiple tiles, it can also be in a composite direction like "B:E". Hmm, why didn't I consider other directions like N,S,W,NE,SE,NW,SW?

Let's remember the definitions of the cardinal directions:

- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

From our analysis, we know that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Given these constraints, x cannot be strictly north or south of z. This rules out N, S, NW, NE, SW, and SE as single-tile relations. Also, since x is to the right of y and y is not beyond the right edge of z, x can't be to the left of z, which rules out W.

But if we're considering composite directions, we need to think differently. x can intersect multiple tiles of z.

Actually, let's be more precise.  When we say "a R b" where R is a cardinal direction, we're precisely saying "a is in the R tile of b". 

Let's draw this out.  The cardinal direction model partitions the space around a reference region b into 9 tiles: the region b itself (B) and 8 surrounding tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).  

Given a region z as the reference, and another region x, the cardinal direction of x relative to z is given by which tiles of z that x intersects. If x intersects only one tile, then the relation is a single-tile cardinal direction. If x intersects multiple tiles, then the relation is a composite cardinal direction.

I understand that in our context, the possible relations should be single-tile relations, not composite ones.  

In the question I'm asked, I'm trying to determine  "which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?".  So, I'm looking for  single-tile relations R such that "x R z" holds based on the given constraints.  Let me re-solve the problem from the beginning.

Given:
- x E y (meaning x is in the E tile of y)
- y B z (meaning y is in the B tile of z)

For x to be in the E tile of y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is not below y's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is not above y's top)

For y to be in the B tile of z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left is not to the left of z's left)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right is not to the right of z's right)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom is not below z's bottom)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is not above z's top)

Now, let's determine which tile of z can x be in.

First, let's consider the E tile of z. For x to be in the E tile of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is not below z's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is not above z's top)

From the given constraints, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

Therefore, we have supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)). 

If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is strictly to the right of z.
Given that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), x would be in the E tile of z.

But if infx(x) <= supx(z), then x and z have overlapping x-projections. In this case, x could be anywhere from partially overlapping with z to being completely inside z. 

Let's check other tiles.

For x to be in the B tile of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left is not to the left of z's left)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right is not to the right of z's right)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is not below z's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is not above z's top)

From the given constraints, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

We have supx(y) <= infx(x) but we don't know the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). 

If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), along with the y-coordinate constraints, x would be in the B tile of z.

Let's check other tiles systematically.

For x to be in the N tile of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left is not to the left of z's left)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right is not to the right of z's right)

But from the given constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). This contradicts the requirement for N. So, x cannot be in the N tile of z.

For x to be in the S tile of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left is not to the left of z's left)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right is not to the right of z's right)

But from the given constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This contradicts the requirement for S. So, x cannot be in the S tile of z.

For x to be in the W tile of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is not below z's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is not above z's top)

But from the given constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z). These imply supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which means it's not necessary that supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x might not be in the W tile of z.

For x to be in the NE tile of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

But we know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts the requirement for NE. So, x cannot be in the NE tile of z.

For x to be in the NW tile of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

But as discussed for W and NE, these conditions can't be met given the constraints. So, x cannot be in the NW tile of z.

For x to be in the SE tile of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

But we know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement for SE. So, x cannot be in the SE tile of z.

For x to be in the SW tile of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

But as discussed for W and SE, these conditions can't be met given the constraints. So, x cannot be in the SW tile of z.

To summarize, based on the given constraints, x can be in either the E tile of z or the B tile of z, depending on the specific coordinates.

Actually, I have an issue. My understanding of the question was: given the constraints, which tiles could x occupy?

But, the more correct understanding might be: given the constraints, for which cardinal direction relations R is "x R z" satisfied?

So, let me try again. We're trying to find the possible cardinal direction relations R such that "x R z" holds, based on the given constraints.

From the analysis, we've established that:
1. If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is in the E tile of z, so "x E z" holds.
2. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), along with the y-coordinate constraints, x is in the B tile of z, so "x B z" holds.

These are the possible single-tile relations between x and z given the constraints.

But wait, let me go back to the original question. "If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" My task is to determine the possible single-tile cardinal directions that can describe the relation between x and z.

I misunderstood when I said "x can be in the E tile of z or the B tile of z". In the cardinal direction framework, the relations are denoted like "x R z", where x is the primary region and z is the reference region. So, I should be saying "x can be E of z" or "x can be B of z".

Let me now focus on the question. Given that "x is E of y" and "y is B of z", we want to find the possible relations between x and z.

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is not below z's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is not above z's top)

Our analysis has shown that, under the given constraints, it's possible for x to be E of z.

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left is not to the left of z's left)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right is not to the right of z's right)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is not below z's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is not above z's top)

We've also shown that, under certain conditions within the constraints, x can be B of z.

I've already established that x cannot be N, S, W, NE, SE, NW, or SW of z.

So, the  possible relationships between x and z, given that x is E of y and y is B of z, are:
- E: x is East of z
- B: x is in the Bounding box of z

Actually, let's consider one more case I missed, and this is a composition of both. So far I've found the cases where x is either fully in the E tile of z or fully in the B tile of z. But, it's also possible for x to be partially in both tiles, resulting in the composite direction "B:E". In the language of the problem, the the cardinal direction relation given by "x (B:E) z".

Actually, I'm not sure I'm on the right track. Let's completely start over.

In my understanding, we need to determine which of the 9 possible basic relationships mentioned in the problem (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) can hold between x and z. This means we're looking for which of these binary relations, denoted x R z (where R is one of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B), can be satisfied given the constraints x E y and y B z.

Let me be more formal in my approach.

From the definitions:
- "x E y" means supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y), infy(y) <= infy(x) (x doesn't extend below y), and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x doesn't extend above y).
- "y B z" means infx(z) <= infx(y) (y doesn't extend to the left of z), supx(y) <= supx(z) (y doesn't extend to the right of z), infy(z) <= infy(y) (y doesn't extend below z), and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y doesn't extend above z).

From these, we can derive the constraints on x in relation to z.

For the x coordinates:
- From supx(y) <= infx(x) (given x E y), we know x is to the right of y.
- From infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (given y B z), we know y is within the x-range of z.

Combining these, we can infer:
- x is to the right of y, and y is within the x-range of z.
- This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z in the x-dimension. x could be to the right of z, or it could overlap with z in the x-dimension.

For the y coordinates:
- From infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (given x E y), we know x is within the y-range of y.
- From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (given y B z), we know y is within the y-range of z.

Combining these, we can infer:
- x is within the y-range of y, and y is within the y-range of z.
- This means x is also within the y-range of z.

Now, let's check each possible cardinal direction relation to see if it's possible for x R z to hold, given our constraints.

For x N z to hold, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But we've established that supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

For x S z to hold, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But we've established that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(x) >= infy(z). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

For x W z to hold, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But we've established that supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). Given the transitivity of <= and the fact that infx(y) < supx(y) (since y is assumed to be a proper region), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) < infx(x), which doesn't ensure supx(x) <= infx(z). In fact, if infx(x) < supx(x) (which is the case for a proper region x), then it's not possible for supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true. Hence, x cannot be W of z.

For x NW z to hold, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've already established that x cannot be W of z, so it also cannot be NW of z.

For x SW z to hold, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've already established that x cannot be W of z and cannot be S of z, so it also cannot be SW of z.

For x NE z to hold, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've already established that x cannot be N of z, so it also cannot be NE of z.

For x SE z to hold, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've already established that x cannot be S of z, so it also cannot be SE of z.

For x E z to hold, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) is not directly given or derivable from the given constraints. It could be the case that supx(z) <= infx(x) (which would make x E of z), or it could be that infx(x) < supx(z) (which would mean x's x-range overlaps with z's). So, it's possible for x to be E of z, but it's not guaranteed.

For x B z to hold, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But the constraints infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are not directly given or derivable from the given constraints. It could be the case that both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) hold (which would make x B of z), or it could be that one or both of these conditions don't hold.

To summarize, based on the constraints given, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- E: If supx(z) <= infx(x).
- B: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, the answer to the question "If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is that x could be either E of z or B of z, depending on the specific coordinates.

Actually, let's think again about that. So far, I have reasoned that the only possible relations are B and E. But is that really the case, or are there other possibilities?

Let's review my earlier constraints. From our analysis, we've established that:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), meaning x is within the y-range of z.
- x is to the right of y, and y is within the x-range of z.

For the relationship between x and z in the x-dimension, there are several possibilities:
1. supx(z) < infx(x): x is strictly to the right of z.
2. infx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): x is completely within the x-range of z.
3. infx(x) <= supx(z) and (infx(x) < infx(z) or supx(z) < supx(x)): x and z have overlapping x-ranges, but x is not completely within the x-range of z.

In case 1, given the y-coordinate constraints, x would be E of z.
In case 2, given the y-coordinate constraints, x would be B of z.
In case 3, x would be in multiple tiles of z, resulting in a composite direction.

but wait, we've argued that
infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)

so actually, infx(z) <= infx(x) is guaranteed to hold and infx(x) < infx(z) (in option 3) is not possible.  This means option 3 simplifies to 

3. infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) < supx(x): x spans the right edge of z.

Hmm, what happens in case 3? Here, x spans the right edge of z. Given the y-coordinate constraints, x would be in both the B tile and the E tile of z. I'm not sure if we can simply say "x is B of z" or "x is E of z" in this case. The correct way to describe this relation might be "x is (B:E) of z", where (B:E) is a composite direction.

Actually, I'm not clear if the question is asking for the basic tile that x can be in, or if it's asking for the composite direction relations as well. Let me reread the problem statement to be clear.

Based on the problem statement, the cardinal direction relation is an expression in the form "R1: … : Rk" where each Ri is a single-tile direction. So, in the context of the question, I believe we need to determine all possible single-tile or composite directions that can describe the relation between x and z.

I'll first list the potential single-tile directions:
- E: When supx(z) < infx(x)
- B: When infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Now, for the potential composite directions. As we've discussed, if infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) < supx(x), then x spans both the B and E tiles. This would be denoted as "x (B:E) z".

But, wait. Is this the way I'm asked to express my answer? Let's revisit the problem statement again.

The problem statement says:

"The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B."

So it seems I'm only expected to provide the basic single-tile directions, not composite ones. And based on my reasoning, the possible single-tile directions are E and B.

Actually, what the problem means is I should select from the list "N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B".  It could be some of those, not a composite answer like "B:E".  From what I've reasoned, I'll select the answers E and B.

Let's double-check once more.  I explored the constraints as follows.

For the x coordinates:
- From x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

These do not strictly determine the relationship between x and z in the x-dimension. x could be to the right of z (supx(z) < infx(x)), or it could be within the x-range of z (infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)), or it could span the right edge of z (infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) < supx(x)).

For the y coordinates:
- From x E y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y B z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means x is within the y-range of z.

Given these constraints, the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- E: If supx(z) < infx(x)
- B: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

It's also worth noting that, in some cases, x could span both the B and E tiles, resulting in a composite direction. But as per the question, I'm focused on the basic single-tile directions.

So based on the constraints given, the answer is that region x can be related to region z by either the E (East) direction or the B (Bounding box) direction, depending on the specific coordinates.

So, to summarize: the possible relations between region x and region z, given that region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, are E and B.

Actually, I think I'm missing something. I've been too rigid in my approach. Let's take a step back.

So we're given that
- x E y
- y B z

Let me think about the problem more intuitively. The fact that x is to the East of y means that x is located to the right of y. And y is within the bounding box of z, meaning y is inside z.

If y is inside z, and x is to the right of y, then x would be either inside z (in which case x B z) or to the right of z (in which case x E z). But, if z is a complex shape or if x is a large region, x might not neatly fit into either the B tile or the E tile. x could partially overlap with z or be to the right of z in a way that it spans multiple tiles.

But, since the problem is specifically asking about the possible relations (from the list of N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B), I'd say the possible relations for region x to region z are E and B.

I've been thinking more about this, and I'm convinced that with the constraints "x E y" and "y B z", the possible relations between x and z are just E and B.

When x E y, it means x is to the East of y. And when y B z, it means y is inside the bounding box of z. Intuitively, if y is inside z and x is to the East of y, then x is either inside z (B) or to the East of z (E). The fact that y is strictly within the bound of z, and x is strictly to the East of y, doesn't allow for x to be in any of the other single-tile directions.

The answer to the question is: The possible relations between region x and region z are E (East) and B (Bounding box).

Actually, take one more careful look at the problem statement. It says:

Let me revisit the problem statement. Here's the question: "If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

And the problem statement indicates:
"The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B."

So, we're being asked to pick from this list which direction relations can hold between x and z. Based on my analysis, the possible relations are E and B.

With more clarity, let me be completely certain I haven't missed anything.

Given "x E y" and "y B z", I'll examine whether each of the listed directions can be a possible relation between x and z.

For x N z: I've established that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But this contradicts the above. Hence, x cannot be N of z.

For x NE z: The conditions are supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first might hold, but the second contradicts our earlier findings. Hence, x cannot be NE of z.

For x E z: The conditions are supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two hold from our constraints, and the first might hold depending on the specific regions. Hence, x can be E of z.

For x SE z: The conditions are supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). While the first might hold, the second contradicts our finding that infy(z) <= infy(x). Hence, x cannot be SE of z.

For x S z: The conditions are supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The second might hold, but the first contradicts our finding that infy(z) <= infy(x). Hence, x cannot be S of z.

For x SW z: The conditions are supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first contradicts our finding that supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which together imply infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) (meaning infx(z) < infx(x), which assuming x has non-zero width, makes it impossible for supx(x) <= infx(z)). And the second contradicts our finding that infy(z) <= infy(x). Hence, x cannot be SW of z.

For x W z: The conditions are supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two hold, but the first contradicts our findings. Hence, x cannot be W of z.

For x NW z: The conditions are supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these contradict our findings. Hence, x cannot be NW of z.

For x B z: The conditions are infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two hold, and the first two might hold depending on the specific regions. Hence, x can be B of z.

To summarize, based on the constraints from "x E y" and "y B z", the possible relations between x and z are E and B.

Let's double-check this once more. I've deduced that:
- For the y-coordinates, x is guaranteed to be within the y-range of z: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- For the x-coordinates, there are multiple possibilities, but mainly: x can be either to the right of z or within the x-range of z.

Given these, and the definitions of the cardinal directions, the only directions from the list that could be possible for x in relation to z are E and B. All other directions (N, NE, SE, S, SW, W, NW) are ruled out based on the constraints.

So, the final answer is: The possible relations between region x and region z are E (East) and B (Bounding box).

ANSWER:

The question requires me to determine which cardinal direction relations could hold between region x and region z, given that:
- region x is E of region y
- region y is B of region z

Let me analyze what these given relations tell us:

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x doesn't extend below y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x doesn't extend above y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y doesn't extend left of z)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y doesn't extend right of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y doesn't extend below z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend above z)

Combining these constraints:
- For y-coordinates: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
  This means x is within the y-range of z.
- For x-coordinates: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
  This means x is to the right of y, and y is within the x-range of z.

Based on these constraints, there are two possible relations between x and z:

1. E (East): When supx(z) < infx(x)
   In this case, x is strictly to the right of z.

2. B (Bounding box): When infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   In this case, x is completely within the bounds of z.

All other cardinal directions (N, NE, SE, S, SW, W, NW) are ruled out by our constraints.
