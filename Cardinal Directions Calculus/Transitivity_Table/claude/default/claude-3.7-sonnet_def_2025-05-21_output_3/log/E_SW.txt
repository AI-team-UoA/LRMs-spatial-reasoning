PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let me recall the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now, let's apply these definitions to our scenario:

1. x E y means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. y SW z means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's see if we can determine the relationship between x and z based on these constraints.

From x E y, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x). 
From y SW z, we know that supx(y) <= infx(z).

So, we have: 
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z)

This doesn't directly give us a relation between infx(x) and infx(z). x could be to the east, northeast, southeast, or other directions relative to z.

Let's look at the y-coordinate constraints:

From x E y, we know that:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y SW z, we know that:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z)

So, we have:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This tells us that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z in terms of the y-coordinate.

Now, using these constraints, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

From supy(x) <= infy(z), we know that x is in one of the southern relations relative to z: S, SW, or SE.

Since we don't have a definitive relation between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z), x could be to the east, west, or within the x-projection of z.

Let's analyze the possible relations:

1. If infx(x) >= supx(z), then x is to the east of z (in terms of the x-coordinate). Since we know x is below z (in terms of the y-coordinate), the relation would be SE.

2. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the west of z (in terms of the x-coordinate). Since we know x is below z, the relation would be SW.

3. If there's an overlap in the x-projections (i.e., infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(x) or infx(x) <= supx(z) <= supx(x)), then x could be directly below z, and the relation would be S.

I need to actually look more carefully at the constraints. So far:

From x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right/east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is at or above y's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left/west of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, from "supx(y) <= infx(x)" and "supx(y) <= infx(z)", we can't directly determine the relation between infx(x) and infx(z). Both x and z are to the right of y, but we don't know their relative positions in the x-axis.

However, from "supy(x) <= supy(y)" and "supy(y) <= infy(z)", we get "supy(x) <= infy(z)". This means x is below z, so x can't be N, NE, or NW of z.

Now, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z based on the x-axis:

1. If infx(x) >= supx(z), then x is to the right/east of z. Combined with the fact that x is below z, the relation would be SE.

2. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the left/west of z. Combined with the fact that x is below z, the relation would be SW.

3. If there's an overlap in the x-projections, then x could be directly below z, and the relation would be S.

However, we need to be careful. From the given constraints, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y SW z)

This doesn't tell us the relation between infx(x) and infx(z). Both x and z are to the right of y in terms of the x-coordinate, but we don't know their relative positions.

Similarly, the relation between supx(x) and infx(z) is unknown.

Let's see if there are any indirect constraints.

From x E y, we know that infx(x) >= supx(y).
From y SW z, we know that infx(z) >= supx(y).

But this doesn't give us a direct relation between infx(x) and infx(z).

Without additional information, I can't definitively place x to the east, west, or in-line with z in terms of the x-coordinate.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z based on the given constraints are:
- S (if there's an overlap in the x-projections)
- SW (if x is to the left/west of z)
- SE (if x is to the right/east of z)

Actually, let me reason more carefully. Maybe I was too restrictive. Let's derive what we can from the original constraints.

From x E y, we get:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right/east of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is at or above y's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)

From y SW z, we get:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left/west of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Here are constraints on the x-coordinate relations:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (z is to the right of y)

This doesn't tell us the relation between x and z in terms of the x-coordinate.

For the y-coordinate relations:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is at or above y's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we get supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z.

But there's another constraint: infy(y) <= infy(x). 

Combining the constraints, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is at or above y's bottom)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From supy(x) <= infy(z), we know x is in one of the southern relations relative to z: S, SW, or SE.

But we also know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (z is to the right of y)

Both x and z are to the right of y, but we don't know their relative positions. x could be to the right of z, to the left of z, or overlap with z in the x-coordinate.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (if there's an overlap in the x-projections)
- SW (if x is to the left/west of z)
- SE (if x is to the right/east of z)

Let me be very careful and double-check this answer.

So we have:
* x is E of y
* y is SW of z

Working with the x-axis:
From x E y, we get supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
From y SW z, we get supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

These constraints don't give us a direct relation between infx(x) and infx(z), or between supx(x) and supx(z).

Working with the y-axis:
From x E y, we get infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
From y SW z, we get supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z.

Given these constraints, here are the possible relations between x and z:

1. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is directly below z, and the relation would be S.

2. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the left/west of z. Combined with the fact that x is below z, the relation would be SW.

3. If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is to the right/east of z. Combined with the fact that x is below z, the relation would be SE.

But since we don't have enough information to determine the exact x-coordinate relations between x and z, all three of these relations are possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: S, SW, and SE.

Actually, let me think more broadly. Could there be any other possible relations between x and z? 

The main constraint we have is supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z in terms of the y-coordinate.

This rules out the following relations: N, NE, NW.

Now, let's consider the constraints in the x-axis. 

From the original constraints, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (z is to the right of y)

This doesn't tell us much about the relation between x and z in terms of the x-coordinate.

Let's consider all possible relations and see if any can be ruled out:

1. x N z: Ruled out because x is below z.
2. x NE z: Ruled out because x is below z.
3. x E z: To have x E z, we need supy(x) ≤ supy(z), but we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ supy(z). And, we also need infy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we don't know if this holds. Actually I guess we can reason further. We know infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). From these, we can't determine the relation between infy(x) and infy(z).

Actually, I think I'm being too restrictive. Let's look at the exact definitions again.

a E b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

For x E z, we would need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

But from our constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is completely below z in terms of the y-coordinate. This contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) required for x E z.

So, x E z is ruled out.

4. x SE z: To have x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We already know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we don't know the relation between supx(z) and infx(x). So, x SE z is possible.

5. x S z: To have x S z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we don't know the relations between infx(z) and infx(x), or between supx(x) and supx(z). So, x S z is possible.

6. x SW z: To have x SW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We already know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we don't know the relation between supx(x) and infx(z). So, x SW z is possible.

7. x W z: To have x W z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) required for x W z. So, x W z is ruled out.

8. x NW z: Ruled out because x is below z.

9. x B z: To have x B z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) required for x B z. So, x B z is ruled out.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, S, and SW.

Let me double-check my reasoning:

From x E y and y SW z, we derived the constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is completely below z in terms of the y-coordinate. This rules out all relations where x would be above, at the same level, or overlapping with z in the y-coordinate.

The only possible relations are those where x is below z: SE, S, or SW, depending on the relative positions of x and z in the x-coordinate, which can't be determined from the given constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, S, and SW.

Actually, wait. Let me check this a bit more. I've been assuming that we know x is completely below z in the y-coordinate because of the constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which implies x is in one of the S, SE, or SW relations with z). But I should double-check that I've derived that constraint correctly. 

From x E y, we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
From y SW z, we get supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

By transitivity, we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is completely below z in the y-coordinate.

But let me be even more careful. Let's recall the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Given x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

Given y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), meaning x is completely below z in the y-coordinate.

Now, let's check the relative positions of x and z in the x-coordinate:

From x E y, we get supx(y) <= infx(x).
From y SW z, we get supx(y) <= infx(z).

But we can't deduce a clear relation between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z). Both x and z are to the right of y, but we don't know their relative positions.

So, depending on the relative positions of x and z in the x-coordinate, the relation could be SE, S, or SW.

For the relation to be SE, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've established supy(x) <= infy(z), but we haven't established supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the relation to be S, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've established supy(x) <= infy(z), but we haven't established the other conditions.

For the relation to be SW, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've established supy(x) <= infy(z), but we haven't established supx(x) <= infx(z).

Given that we've only established one of the conditions for each of SE, S, and SW, and we don't have enough information to determine the x-coordinate relations, all three of these relations are possible.

Now, I'll check if any other relations are possible.

For the relation to be E, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've established supy(x) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) < infy(z) <= supy(z) (since any region has infy <= supy). However, the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) required for x E z, since that would mean infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), implying supy(x) <= infy(x), which is impossible. So, x E z is ruled out.

Similarly, we can rule out W, NW, N, NE, and B using the same reasoning.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, S, and SW.

Actually, let's think about it differently. Let me look at concrete examples.

Say y is at the origin, and y is SW of z. Let's place z at (1, 1) to satisfy y SW z. So we have:
- y at (0, 0)
- z at (1, 1)

Now, x is E of y. Let's place x at (1, 0) to satisfy x E y. So we have:
- y at (0, 0)
- z at (1, 1)
- x at (1, 0)

What is the relation between x and z? x is at (1, 0) and z is at (1, 1). In this case, x is S of z.

Let's try another example. Say y is at the origin and z is at (1, 1). But x is at (2, 0). Now what is the relation between x and z? x is SE of z.

Or what if y is again at the origin and z is at (1, 1), but x is at (0.5, 0)? The relation between x and z would be SW.

These examples confirm our analysis: the possible relations between x and z are SE, S, and SW.

Are there other examples that would give different relations? Let's try.

If y is at the origin, z is at (1, 1), and x is at (1, 0.5), what is the relation between x and z? x is S of z.

If y is at the origin, z is at (1, 1), and x is at (1.5, 0.5), what is the relation between x and z? x is SE of z.

If y is at the origin, z is at (1, 1), and x is at (0.5, 0.5), what is the relation between x and z? x is SW of z.

I'm confident in our conclusion: given the constraints x E y and y SW z, the possible relations between x and z are SE, S, and SW.

Let me double-check this answer one more time:

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is completely below z in the y-coordinate.

But we cannot deduce a clear relation between x and z in the x-coordinate. Both x and z are to the right of y, but we don't know their relative positions.

Given that x is completely below z in the y-coordinate, the only possible relations are SE, S, and SW, depending on their relative positions in the x-coordinate. Since we don't have enough information to determine this, all three relations are possible.

So our final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are: SE, S, and SW.

Actually, before I give my final answer, let me try to think about another edge case.

Let's look at the definitions one more time:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now, let's think about a case:

If y has a y-dimension, e.g. it spans from y=0 to y=1 (so actually, it can't be a point in our examples):
- y at rectangle (0, 0) to (0.5, 1)
- z at rectangle (1, 2) to (2, 3)
- x at rectangle (2, 0.5) to (3, 0.8)

In this case, is x E of y? 
- supx(y) = 0.5 ≤ infx(x) = 2 (true)
- infy(y) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 0.5 (true)
- supy(x) = 0.8 ≤ supy(y) = 1 (true)
Yes, x E y.

Is y SW of z?
- supx(y) = 0.5 ≤ infx(z) = 1 (true)
- supy(y) = 1 ≤ infy(z) = 2 (true)
Yes, y SW z.

What is the relation between x and z?
Let's check the y-coordinate constraint:
- supy(x) = 0.8 ≤ infy(z) = 2 (true)
So, x is below z.

Now, let's check the x-coordinate relation:
- supx(z) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 2 (true, but it's a boundary case)
So, x is to the right of z.

With supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x), the relation between x and z is SE.

But you know what's funny? In this case, the x-bounds barely touch, which is a valid case for SE, since supx(z) = 2 = infx(x). Can we find a case where a different relation holds?

Let's modify the example:
- y at rectangle (0, 0) to (0.5, 1)
- z at rectangle (1, 2) to (3, 3)
- x at rectangle (0.8, 0.5) to (2, 0.8)

Is x E of y?
- supx(y) = 0.5 ≤ infx(x) = 0.8 (true)
- infy(y) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 0.5 (true)
- supy(x) = 0.8 ≤ supy(y) = 1 (true)
Yes, x E y.

Is y SW of z?
- supx(y) = 0.5 ≤ infx(z) = 1 (true)
- supy(y) = 1 ≤ infy(z) = 2 (true)
Yes, y SW z.

What is the relation between x and z?
Let's check the y-coordinate constraint:
- supy(x) = 0.8 ≤ infy(z) = 2 (true)
So, x is below z.

Now, let's check the x-coordinate relation:
- infx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 0.8? No, this is false.
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 1? No, this is false.
- supx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(x) = 0.8? No, this is false.

In this case, there's an overlap in the x-projections of x and z. Specifically, x spans from x=0.8 to x=2, and z spans from x=1 to x=3. The interval [1, 2] is the overlap.

Given that x is below z and there's an overlap in the x-projections, the relation between x and z is S.

Let me ensure this:

x S z requires:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (true)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (false)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (true)

Ok, so it's not quite S.

Let's clarify this:

For region a to be related S to region b, all of the following must hold:
1. supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is below b)
2. infx(b) <= infx(a) (a's left boundary is to the right of or at b's left boundary)
3. supx(a) <= supx(b) (a's right boundary is to the left of or at b's right boundary)

In our case, we have x and z, and the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) is not satisfied.

Let me reformulate:

x S z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (true)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (false, since 1 ≤ 0.8 is false)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (true, since 2 ≤ 3 is true)

Since not all conditions are met, the relation is not S.

Let me clarify again.

S: If region a is S (south) of region b, it means a is below b, and the x-projection of a is within the x-projection of b.
SW: If region a is SW (southwest) of region b, it means a is to the left and below b.
SE: If region a is SE (southeast) of region b, it means a is to the right and below b.

In our example, x spans from x=0.8 to x=2, and z spans from x=1 to x=3. The x-projection of x is not entirely to the left or right of the x-projection of z, and it's not entirely within the x-projection of z. This makes the relation unclear.

Ah, I got confused. Let's be precise once more about the definition of S relation:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For x S z, we need:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z) (true)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (false, since 1 > 0.8)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z) (true, since 2 < 3)

Since condition 2 is not satisfied, x is not S of z.

Now, let's check for SE:

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x SE z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (false, since 3 > 0.8)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) (true)

Since condition 1 is not satisfied, x is not SE of z.

Let's check for SW:

a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (false, since 2 > 1)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) (true)

Since condition 1 is not satisfied, x is not SW of z.

This is confusing. Let me try to think about it differently. 

Given the set up:
- y at rectangle (0, 0) to (0.5, 1)
- z at rectangle (1, 2) to (3, 3)
- x at rectangle (0.8, 0.5) to (2, 0.8)

This means:
infx(y) = 0, supx(y) = 0.5, infy(y) = 0, supy(y) = 1
infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 3
infx(x) = 0.8, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 0.5, supy(x) = 0.8

Is it possible that the relation betwen x and z is a multi-tile relation? Actually, I'm still not thinking about this correctly. Let's start over.

Given:
- y at rectangle (0, 0) to (0.5, 1)
- z at rectangle (1, 2) to (3, 3)
- x at rectangle (0.8, 0.5) to (2, 0.8)

We want to find the relation between x and z.

Let's use our understanding of axis projections. We can visualize the x-axis projection of both regions:

x-axis: 0.8 ______ 2 (region x)
z-axis: 1 __________ 3 (region z)

There's an overlap, so the relation can't be solely E or W.

Now, the y-axis projection:

x-axis: 0.5 __ 0.8 (region x)
z-axis: 2 __ 3 (region z)

There's no overlap in the y-direction. Region x is entirely below region z.

Given these, the relation between x and z is not a single-tile relation. It's a multi-tile relation.

Actually, I'm making this way too complicated.

Let's be clear about the definitions of the single-tile relations:

- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now, let's check if any of these relations hold for x relative to z in our example:

B: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The third condition is false (2 ≰ 0.5).
S: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The second condition is false (1 ≰ 0.8).
SW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition is false (2 ≰ 1).
W: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is false (2 ≰ 1) and the second condition is false (2 ≰ 0.5).
NW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both conditions are false.
N: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The first condition is false (3 ≰ 0.5).
NE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both conditions are false.
E: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is false (3 ≰ 0.8) and the second condition is false (2 ≰ 0.5).
SE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition is false (3 ≰ 0.8).

None of the single-tile relations hold. But the key is "A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

So, a region can be in multiple single-tile relations with respect to another region. In such cases, the relation is a multi-tile relation.

But in our context, the question is about the possible singular relations. Given x E y and y SW z, what are the possible singular relations between x and z?

We established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z in the y-coordinate. But the relationship in the x-coordinate is ambiguous. Depending on the specific positions, x can be to the left, to the right, directly below, or in some combination of these positions relative to z.

If x is to the left of z in the x-coordinate, the relation would be SW. If x is to the right of z, the relation would be SE. If x overlaps with z in the x-coordinate, the relation would be more complex. Let's actually assume we're referring only to single-tile relations.

So based on our analysis and the given constraints, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are: SE, S, and SW.

Actually, let's be even more careful. Let me enumerate the scenarios that work.

Scenario 1: 
- y at (0, 0)
- z at (1, 1)
- x at (0.5, 0)

Is x E of y? Yes:
- supx(y) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 0.5 (true)
- infy(y) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 0 (true)
- supy(x) = 0 ≤ supy(y) = 0 (true)

Is y SW of z? Yes:
- supx(y) = 0 ≤ infx(z) = 1 (true)
- supy(y) = 0 ≤ infy(z) = 1 (true)

What is the relation between x and z? 
- supx(x) = 0.5 ≤ infx(z) = 1 (true)
- supy(x) = 0 ≤ infy(z) = 1 (true)

This is x SW z.

Scenario 2:
- y at (0, 0)
- z at (1, 1)
- x at (1, 0)

Is x E of y? Yes.
Is y SW of z? Yes.
x is S of z.

Scenario 3:
- y at (0, 0)
- z at (1, 1)
- x at (2, 0)

Is x E of y? Yes.
Is y SW of z? Yes.
x is SE of z.

So the possible single-tile relations between x and z are: SE, S, and SW.

Ok, so our final answer is: S, SE, SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means region x is completely below region z in the y-coordinate. However, I cannot determine a definitive relation between x and z in the x-coordinate.

Given that x is completely below z, and considering all possible x-coordinate relationships, the possible relations between x and z are:

S, SE, SW
