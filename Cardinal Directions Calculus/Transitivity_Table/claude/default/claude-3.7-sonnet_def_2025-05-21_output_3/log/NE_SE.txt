PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to find all possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, when we're given that:
- x is NE of y
- y is SE of z

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- x is NE of y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is SE of z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, let's analyze what we can deduce about x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
From x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
From y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y)

Combining these: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
So we can conclude: supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means that x is strictly to the east of z in terms of x-coordinates. This narrows down the possible relations to: NE, E, or SE.

For the y-coordinates:
From x NE y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
From y SE z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
So we can conclude: supy(z) <= infy(x)

This means that x is strictly to the north of z in terms of y-coordinates. This narrows down the possible relations to: NW, N, or NE.

The only relation that satisfies both conditions (east in x-coordinates and north in y-coordinates) is NE.

So, the relation between x and z must be NE.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. What I've shown is that the bounding boxes of x and z satisfy the conditions for NE, but there are other possible configurations depending on the exact shapes of the regions.

Let's think through this more carefully by considering the bounding boxes of x, y, and z.

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is SE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's establish coordinate constraints:
- For x NE y: x is strictly to the east and north of y
  - x-coordinates: supx(y) <= infx(x)
  - y-coordinates: supy(y) <= infy(x)

- For y SE z: y is strictly to the east and south of z
  - x-coordinates: supx(z) <= infx(y)
  - y-coordinates: supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can deduce:
- x-coordinates: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
  Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is east of z
- y-coordinates: We know supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x)

Let's visualize a scenario:

z is positioned in the northwest
y is positioned in the southeast of z
x is positioned in the northeast of y

In this scenario, x could be:
- NE of z (if x is directly northeast of z)
- E of z (if x is directly east of z)
- SE of z (if x is southeast of z)

Let me try to draw this to clarify:

```
    N
  W + E
    S

 z
    y
        x
```

In this arrangement, x would be east of z, but the north-south relationship isn't constrained.

Actually, let's be more precise and use a coordinate system:

```
  ^ y-axis
  |
  |   z
  |
  |      y
  |
  |         x
  |
  +------------> x-axis
```

From the constraints, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is east of z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is south of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)

So, x is definitely east of z (because supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)).

But the north-south relationship between x and z can vary:
- If infy(x) > supy(z), then x would be north of z
- If infy(x) <= supy(z), then x can overlap with z in the north-south direction

Wait, there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let's clarify the cardinal directions again:

- x is NE of y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is SE of z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Note the y-coordinate condition for y SE z: supy(y) <= infy(z). This means y is south of z, not z south of y.

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is SE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we deduce:
- x-coordinates: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
  Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is east of z.
- y-coordinates: We know supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  But we can't directly determine the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).

This means x is definitely east of z, but the north-south relationship can vary.

Actually, there's an inconsistency in my definition of SE. Let me revisit the definitions:

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So, if y is SE of z, then supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is SE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we deduce for the x-coordinates:
supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). 
This indicates that x is east of z.

For the y-coordinates:
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

I can't directly determine the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) from these. So, the north-south relationship between x and z remains undetermined from the given constraints.

Looking at this from another angle, let's try to visualize the regions in a coordinate system:

```
  ^ y-axis
  |
  |   z
  |
  |      y
  |
  |         x
  |
  +------------> x-axis
```

We know:
- y is SE of z, so y is southeast of z.
- x is NE of y, so x is northeast of y.

Given that y is southeast of z and x is northeast of y, x could be:
- NE of z (if x is sufficiently north)
- E of z (if x is roughly at the same latitude as z)
- SE of z (if x is sufficiently south)

Let me derive this more rigorously.

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is SE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For the x-coordinates, we've established that x is east of z: supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the y-coordinates, we know:
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

From these, we can't directly determine if infy(x) is greater than, equal to, or less than infy(z). It depends on the specific regions. Consequently, x can be either north of, at the same latitude as, or south of z.

Given that x is east of z, and can have varying north-south relationships with z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- NE (if x is northeast of z)
- E (if x is directly east of z)
- SE (if x is southeast of z)

But I'm still not clear if I have defined the SE relation correctly. Let me go back to the problem statement. The definition of SE is:

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

This means a is to the east of b and a is to the south of b.

Now, let's redefine the constraints:
- x is NE of y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This means x is to the east of y and x is to the north of y.
- y is SE of z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z). This means y is to the east of z and y is to the south of z.

With these clear definitions, let's deduce the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
Combining, we get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinates:
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

I can't derive the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) directly from the constraints. This means the north-south relationship between x and z can vary.

Since x is to the east of z, and the north-south relationship can vary, x can be NE, E, or SE of z.

Actually, once more, I want to make sure I'm interpretting SE correctly.

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Looking at the given definitions:
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

For a SE b:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) means a is to the east of b
- supy(a) <= infy(b) means a is to the south of b

So, y SE z means y is southeast of z, which is consistent with my earlier interpretation.

Given:
- x NE y
- y SE z

I've established that x is east of z. The north-south relationship between x and z can vary depending on the exact positions of the regions.

To exhaustively determine the possible cardinal direction relations, let me consider the possible cases:

1. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is north of z. Combined with x being east of z, x can be NE of z.

2. If infy(x) = supy(z), then the northmost point of z aligns with the southmost point of x. In this case, it's a complex relation, but in general, x can be E of z.

3. If infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) > infy(z), then x and z overlap in their y-projection. In this case, x can be E of z.

4. If supy(x) = infy(z), then the southmost point of z aligns with the northmost point of x. Again, this is a complex relation, but generally, x can be E of z or SE of z depending on the exact shapes and positions.

5. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is south of z. Combined with x being east of z, x can be SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE
- E
- SE

But wait, in all cases I'm assuming x and z are separate regions. However, their bounding boxes might overlap, allowing for more complex relations. Let's consider these cases too.

Given:
- x NE y
- y SE z

If the bounding boxes of x and y are separate, and the bounding boxes of y and z are separate, then x and z can still have overlapping bounding boxes.

For the x-coordinate, I've established: supx(z) <= infx(x). This ensures that x is east of z in terms of bounding boxes.

For the y-coordinate, as I've shown, the relationship can vary. Without additional constraints, x can be north of, at the same latitude as, or south of z.

Given the definitions:
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which I've established)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which can be true for certain positions)

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which I've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which can be true for certain positions)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which can be true for certain positions)

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which I've established)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which can be true for certain positions)

Without further constraints, all three relations (NE, E, SE) between x and z are possible.

I want to try once more time to be thorough. 

First, I'll try to determine the precise range of possible y-coordinates for x, y, and z.

Given:
- x is NE of y, which means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is SE of z, which means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now let me assume specific values for the bounding boxes of these regions to check the possible relationships:

Let's say the bounding box of z is [1, 3] x [7, 9]:
- infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3
- infy(z) = 7, supy(z) = 9

Then from y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y), which means 3 <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(y) <= 7

Let's say the bounding box of y is [4, 6] x [5, 7]:
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6
- infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 7

From x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x), which means 6 <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x), which means 7 <= infy(x)

Let's say the bounding box of x is [7, 9] x [8, 10]:
- infx(x) = 7, supx(x) = 9
- infy(x) = 8, supy(x) = 10

Given these specific values, let's check the relationship between x and z.

For the x-coordinate:
infx(x) = 7, supx(z) = 3
Since 3 < 7, we have supx(z) < infx(x), which means x is east of z.

For the y-coordinate:
infy(x) = 8, supy(z) = 9
Since 8 < 9, we don't have supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is not north of z. In fact, because the y ranges [8, 10] and [7, 9] overlap, x is neither north nor south of z.

For E relation, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), which is True (3 <= 7)
- infy(z) <= infy(x), which is True (7 <= 8)
- supy(x) <= supy(z), which is False (10 > 9)

So, in this specific example, x is not E of z. Let me try to understand what relation it is.

Actually, the regions can have a more complex relation than just NE, E, or SE. Let's denote the regions as a collection of cardinal directions. For example, x can be both NE and E of z.

From our example, x is east of z, and it partially overlaps with z in the y-direction. This doesn't fit neatly into one of the nine basic cardinal directions. In general, if the bounding boxes of x and z overlap in the y-direction, the relation can be a combination of the cardinal directions.

But actually taking a step back, given the constraints from x NE y and y SE z, the possible basic cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- NE
- E
- SE

I think this is due to what I had deduced: x is east of z, and the north-south relationship can vary.

Given:
- x NE y
- y SE z

We know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
Combining: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This means supx(z) <= infx(x), which indicates x is east of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

From these, I can't directly determine the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). Similarly, I can't directly determine the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

With x definitely east of z and the north-south relationship undetermined, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- NE (if x is east of and north of z)
- E (if x is east of and overlaps with z in the y-direction)
- SE (if x is east of and south of z)

Actually wait. I need to be more careful about when a relation belongs to one of the 9 basic cardinal directions. Let me explicitly compute all 9 basic cardinal directions to be sure.

For B:
- x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Given that x is east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), we can say infx(x) > infx(z) (assuming distinct regions), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). Therefore, x B z is not possible.

For S:
- x S z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Given that x is east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), we can say infx(x) > supx(z) (assuming distinct regions), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Therefore, x S z is not possible.

For SW:
- x SW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Given that x is east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), we can say infx(x) > supx(z) (assuming distinct regions), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, x SW z is not possible.

For W:
- x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Given that x is east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), we can say infx(x) > supx(z) (assuming distinct regions), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, x W z is not possible.

For NW:
- x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
  Given that x is east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), we can say infx(x) > supx(z) (assuming distinct regions), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, x NW z is not possible.

For N:
- x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Given that x is east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), we can say infx(x) > supx(z) (assuming distinct regions), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Therefore, x N z is not possible.

For NE:
- x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
  We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x). The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) can be true or false depending on the exact positions. So, x NE z is possible.

For E:
- x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x). The conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) can be true or false depending on the exact positions. So, x E z is possible.

For SE:
- x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
  We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x). The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) can be true or false depending on the exact positions. So, x SE z is possible.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- NE
- E
- SE

I've ruled out all other possibilities by checking the definitions of each cardinal direction relation.

Actually, I think we need to check more carefully when a region can be in relation E with another region. Let me re-read the definitions:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which I've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which can be true or false depending on the exact positions)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which can be true or false depending on the exact positions)

So, x E z is possible if both infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are satisfied. This means z's y-range should encompass or be equal to x's y-range.

Given:
- x NE y
- y SE z

We know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

From these, I can't directly determine if infy(z) <= infy(x) or if supy(x) <= supy(z). So, the E relation remains a possibility.

In conclusion, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- NE
- E
- SE

Actually, wait, I think I still need to look into this a bit more. 

Given that x is NE of y, this means x is to the northeast of y, or:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

Given that y is SE of z, this means y is to the southeast of z, or:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

For the x-coordinate, we can deduce:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is east of z in terms of the x-coordinate.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Let's restate this: y is to the south of z and x is to the north of y.

There are three possibilities:
1. x is to the north of z. This corresponds to the NE relation.
2. x and z have overlapping y-ranges. This corresponds to the E relation.
3. x is to the south of z. This corresponds to the SE relation.

But hang on, let's see if I can find any constraints on the y-coordinates that would rule out any of these possibilities.

We know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

From these, I can't directly determine the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). Similarly, I can't directly determine the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Let's create a couple of examples to demonstrate the possibilities:

Example 1 (NE):
- z has y-range [10, 15]
- y has y-range [5, 10]
- x has y-range [15, 20]
Here, supy(y) = 10 <= infy(x) = 15, which satisfies the constraint from x NE y. Also, supy(y) = 10 <= infy(z) = 10, which satisfies the constraint from y SE z. In this case, x is NE of z.

Example 2 (E):
- z has y-range [10, 20]
- y has y-range [5, 10]
- x has y-range [15, 18]
Here, supy(y) = 10 <= infy(x) = 15, which satisfies the constraint from x NE y. Also, supy(y) = 10 <= infy(z) = 10, which satisfies the constraint from y SE z. In this case, x is E of z.

Example 3 (SE):
- z has y-range [15, 20]
- y has y-range [5, 10]
- x has y-range [10, 15]
Here, supy(y) = 10 <= infy(x) = 10, which satisfies the constraint from x NE y. Also, supy(y) = 10 <= infy(z) = 15, which satisfies the constraint from y SE z. In this case, x is SE of z.

These examples show that all three relations (NE, E, SE) between x and z are possible. Through a systematic check of the constraint, I've confirned that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- NE
- E
- SE

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

NE, E, SE

To determine this, I analyzed what we know:
- x is NE of y, so: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SE of z, so: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For the x-coordinates:
From these constraints, we get: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
Therefore: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
This means x is definitely east of z.

For the y-coordinates:
We know: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
From these, we cannot directly determine whether x is north of, south of, or at the same latitude as z.

Since x is definitely east of z, but can have varying north-south relationships with z, the possible cardinal direction relations are NE, E, and SE.
