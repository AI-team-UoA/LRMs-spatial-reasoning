PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Alright, so we need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z, given that x is N of y and y is SE of z.

Let me think about the constraints systematically. I'll use the definitions provided in the problem:

1. x is N of y, which means supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
2. y is SE of z, which means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Now, let's try to derive constraints between x and z:

From constraint 1, we know that supy(y) <= infy(x).
From constraint 2, we know that supy(y) <= infy(z).

From constraint 1, we also know that infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
From constraint 2, we know that supx(z) <= infx(y).

So, we can derive that supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x).

But we don't have clear constraints on the y-coordinates of x and z. We know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), but this doesn't directly give us a relation between infy(x) and infy(z).

Let's think of some possible scenarios:

1. If infy(x) > infy(z), then x could be NE of z, since we already know that supx(z) <= infx(x).
2. If infy(x) < infy(z), then x could be E of z, since we already know that supx(z) <= infx(x), and this would satisfy infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
3. If infy(x) = infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x could also be E of z.

Wait, actually I think I'm getting confused and making some mistakes in my reasoning. Let me review the definitions again and ensure I'm applying them correctly.

Oops, I made a mistake when interpreting the constraints for y being SE of z. Let me correct:

y is SE of z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

So, given that:
1. x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
2. y is SE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Let's establish the relationship between x and z.

From 1 and 2, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

The first constraint tells us that x is either NE, E, or SE of z.

Let's consider the y-coordinates:
We know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z). But we don't have a direct constraint between infy(x) and infy(z). 

Oh, I see. I've been misapplying the constraint. Let's correct this:

If y is SE of z, it means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

And if x is N of y, it means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection)

Now, combining these constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x is to the east of z.
- supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

Let's think about the y-coordinates further. We know that supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x), so both x and z are to the north of y. But we still don't have a direct constraint between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z).

Given the constraints we have, x could be:
- NE of z: if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- E of z: if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- SE of z: if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

But wait, we know that supy(y) <= infy(z), and since supy(y) <= infy(x), it's possible for infy(x) <= infy(z) or infy(x) >= infy(z). This means x could be NE, E, or SE of z based on the relative position of infy(x) and infy(z).

Actually, no, that's still not right. Let me approach the problem visually. Let's place region y in the plane, and then place regions x and z based on the given constraints:

- Since x is N of y, x is entirely above y, and its x-projection is contained within y's x-projection.
- Since y is SE of z, y is to the southeast of z, meaning y is both to the east and to the south of z.

Now, given this configuration, where could x be in relation to z?

x is above y, and y is to the southeast of z. This means x is to the north and somewhere in the east of y, and y is to the southeast of z. So x is to the north and east of z.

But the exact cardinal direction relation between x and z depends on the specific positions of the regions. Let's enumerate the possibilities:

1. If x is directly above y and y is directly southeast of z, then x would be NE of z.
2. If x's position is shifted a bit to the east within the constraints, it could still be NE of z.
3. If x's position is shifted a bit to the west (but still above y and within the constraints), it could potentially be N of z or still NE of z, depending on how far west it is shifted.

But I'm not sure. Let me clarify by using the explicit constraints:

1. x is N of y: 
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection)

2. y is SE of z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Based on these, we derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x is to the east of z.
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y).

Now, to determine if x is to the north of z, we need to compare infy(x) and infy(z). But from the given constraints, we don't know the exact relationship. We only know that both infy(x) and infy(z) are greater than supy(y).

Let me think of a concrete example to see if it helps. Consider:
- z's bounding box is [0, 1] x [2, 3],
- y's bounding box is [2, 3] x [0, 1],
- x's bounding box is [2, 3] x [2, 3].

In this example, x is N of y, and y is SE of z. The relation between x and z is that x is NE of z.

Let's try another example:
- z's bounding box is [0, 3] x [2, 3],
- y's bounding box is [2, 5] x [0, 1],
- x's bounding box is [2, 5] x [2, 3].

Here, x is N of y, and y is SE of z. The relation between x and z is that x is E of z.

Hmm, but I think I'm still missing something. In the second example, x doesn't seem to be E of z according to the definition. Let me check again.

E means: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

In the second example, supx(z) = 3, infx(x) = 2, infy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3, and supy(z) = 3. So, supx(z) is not <= infx(x), which means x is not E of z.

Let me draw out diagrams carefully and reconsider. Let's revise the second example:
- z's bounding box is [0, 1] x [2, 4],
- y's bounding box is [2, 3] x [0, 1],
- x's bounding box is [2, 3] x [2, 3].

In this case:
- For the relation between x and y: supy(y) = 1, infy(x) = 2 (1 <= 2 ✓), infx(y) = 2, infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, supx(y) = 3 (2 <= 2 and 3 <= 3 ✓), so x is indeed N of y.
- For the relation between y and z: supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2 (1 <= 2 ✓), supy(y) = 1, infy(z) = 2 (1 <= 2 ✓), so y is indeed SE of z.
- For the relation between x and z: supx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 2 (1 <= 2 ✓), supy(z) = 4, infy(x) = 2 (3 <= 2 ✗ and 4 <= 2 ✗). So, x is not NE of z.

Wait, I messed up the check. Let's try again. I'm looking at the NE relation correctly, right?

NE means: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

In the provided example:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 2 (1 <= 2 ✓)
- supy(z) = 4, infy(x) = 2 (4 <= 2 ✗)

So, x is not NE of z.

Let's think of other possible relations. Is x E of z?

E means: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

In the example:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 2 (1 <= 2 ✓)
- infy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 2 (2 <= 2 ✓)
- supy(x) = 3, supy(z) = 4 (3 <= 4 ✓)

So, x is E of z in this example.

OK I think I got a bit sidetracked. Let me approach the problem abstractly again.

I would like to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is N of y and y is SE of z.

From the definitions:
- x is N of y means:
  * supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
  * infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection)

- y is SE of z means:
  * supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
  * supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x is to the east of z.

To determine if x is also to the north, south, or neither (i.e., aligned) with z, we need to compare the y-coordinates.

We know that supy(y) <= infy(x), and we also know supy(y) <= infy(z). This means both x and z are to the north of y. But without direct information about the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), or between supy(x) and supy(z), we can't definitively say whether x is to the north, south, or aligned with z.

Therefore, based on the given constraints, x could be related to z in one of the following ways:
- NE (if x is to the northeast of z)
- E (if x is directly to the east of z)
- SE (if x is to the southeast of z)

Wait, actually I need to think about this more carefully. Let's say region y is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, region x is to the north of it, so x contains points with coordinates (x, y) where y > 0. Also, x's x-coordinates must lie within the range of y's x-coordinates. So x has points with coordinates (x, y) where x is within the range of y's x-coordinates and y > 0.

And region z is such that region y is to the southeast of it. This means z contains points with coordinates (x, y) where x < the x-coordinates of y and y > the y-coordinates of y. So, z has points with coordinates (x, y) where x < the x-coordinates of y and y > 0.

Given this, region x and region z both have points with y-coordinates greater than 0. But, region x's x-coordinates lie within the range of y's x-coordinates, while region z's x-coordinates are less than y's x-coordinates. This means x and z can be positioned in various ways based on their exact dimensions and positions, leading to different cardinal direction relations between them.

Hmm, I feel like I'm being too vague again. Let me try to simplify. Given the constraints that the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y, and y is to the east of z, we can say that x is to the east of z. But the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z could vary, giving rise to different cardinal direction relations.

OK let me try a slightly different approach. We have:

* x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
* y is SE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Let's denote the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the minimum bounding boxes for x, y, and z as follows:
- For region x: [infx(x), supx(x)] × [infy(x), supy(x)].
- For region y: [infx(y), supx(y)] × [infy(y), supy(y)].
- For region z: [infx(z), supx(z)] × [infy(z), supy(z)].

First we can determine the constraint on the x-coordinates:
- We know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), so the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y.
- supx(z) <= infx(y)

Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). This tells us that the x-coordinates of x are strictly to the east of z.

Now, for the constraints on the y-coordinates, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

But these constraints do not give us a direct relationship between the y-coordinates of regions x and z.

Let's consider some cases:

1. If infy(x) < infy(z): In this case, a part of x could be below z, which means x could be to the southeast of z. Given the constraint that x is to the east of z, the relation would be SE.

2. If infy(x) = infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z): Here, x is aligned with z and fits within the y-projection of z. Given the constraint that x is to the east of z, the relation would be E.

3. If infy(x) = infy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z): Here, x is aligned with z but extends beyond its upper boundary. This could be a combination of E and NE, but given the definition, it would not fit strictly into either one. But let's go with the definitions and check which one applies.
    * For E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've given that the last condition doesn't hold.
    * For NE: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). There's a contradiction with infy(x) = infy(z).
    So, this case doesn't match the provided definitions, and I might need to reconsider.

4. If infy(x) > infy(z): Here, x is entirely above z. Given the constraint that x is to the east of z, the relation would be NE.

Hmm, in case 3, I'm making an error. Let me redo.

If infy(x) = infy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z):
* For E: We need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established that the last condition doesn't hold, so x is not E of z.
* For NE: We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition holds, but the second doesn't (since infy(x) = infy(z), not supy(z) <= infy(x)).

So, in case 3, x is neither E nor NE of z based on the provided definitions. I'm trying to think of what the relation could be.

Actually, given the definitions and the above conditions, case 3 might not be valid. Since x is N of y and y is SE of z, there might be an inherent contradiction in having infy(x) = infy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z).

Ok, I think this is a complex problem that I need to think about step-by-step. Let me go through it again.

Given that x is N of y and y is SE of z, we need to find the possible relations between x and z. When placing these regions in a 2D plane, we have:
- x is above y, and the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y.
- y is to the southeast of z, which means y is both to the east and to the south of z.

Since y is to the east of z and the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of y, x is also to the east of z. This means that the possible relations between x and z are:

(a) NE (if x is to the northeast of z)
(b) E (if x is directly to the east of z)
(c) SE (if x is to the southeast of z)

But let's check if all of these are truly possible. We have:
* x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
* y is SE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

From these, we've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z. But to determine whether x is to the north, aligned, or to the south of z, we need to compare infy(x) with infy(z) and perhaps also supy(x) with supy(z).

Given that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), both x and z are above y. But this doesn't give us the direct relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z.

Let's consider the different cases in detail:

Case 1: x is NE of z
For this to hold, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x). For the second condition, we know supy(y) <= infy(x), but we don't have a direct relation between supy(z) and supy(y). If supy(z) <= supy(y), then supy(z) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which would make x NE of z. But if supy(z) > supy(y), we can't directly conclude that supy(z) <= infy(x).

Wait, I think the problem doesn't have constraints on the type of regions, so for supy(z) we need to find a constraint differently.

Let's continue from another angle. We know that y is SE of z, which means supy(y) <= infy(z). This, along with supy(y) <= infy(x), doesn't directly give us the relation between infy(x) and infy(z).

Let's think of specific arrangements:

What about infy(x) < infy(z)? This seems valid. x is to the north of y, and y is to the southeast of z. So, x and z could be at different heights, with x below z.

What about infy(x) = infy(z)? This seems valid too. x and z could be at the same base level.

What about infy(x) > infy(z)? This also seems valid. x could be higher up than z.

Similarly, we can think of the relative top positions:

What about supy(x) < supy(z)? This means the top boundary of x is below the top boundary of z. This is valid if the entire region x fits below the top of z.

What about supy(x) = supy(z)? This means x and z have the same top boundary. This is valid too.

What about supy(x) > supy(z)? This means the top boundary of x is above the top boundary of z. This is valid as well.

So, it seems like all relative positions of the y-coordinates of x and z could be valid, which would make all three relations (NE, E, and SE) possible.

Let's verify this with some examples:

For x is NE of z:
z's bounding box is [0, 1] × [2, 4],
y's bounding box is [2, 3] × [0, 1],
x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [5, 6].
Here, supy(z) = 4, infy(x) = 5, which gives supy(z) <= infy(x).

For x is E of z:
z's bounding box is [0, 1] × [2, 5],
y's bounding box is [2, 3] × [0, 1],
x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [2, 4].
Here, infy(z) = 2, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4, supy(z) = 5, which gives infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

For x is SE of z:
z's bounding box is [0, 1] × [3, 5],
y's bounding box is [2, 3] × [0, 1],
x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [2, 2.5].
Here, supy(x) = 2.5, infy(z) = 3, which gives supy(x) <= infy(z).

Actually, I'm pretty sure all of NE, E, SE are possible.

But let me just have another sanity check. I'm not going to spell out the full constraints, just think through the examples.

For x is NE of z:
z's bounding box is [0, 1] × [3, 5],
y's bounding box is [2, 3] × [0, 2],
x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [6, 7].
- Is x N of y? Yes, x is above y.
- Is y SE of z? Yes, y is to the southeast of z.
- Is x NE of z? Yes, x is to the northeast of z.

For x is E of z:
z's bounding box is [0, 1] × [3, 6],
y's bounding box is [2, 3] × [0, 2],
x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [3, 5].
- Is x N of y? Yes, x is above y.
- Is y SE of z? Yes, y is to the southeast of z.
- Is x E of z? Yes, x is directly to the east of z.

For x is SE of z:
z's bounding box is [0, 1] × [5, 8],
y's bounding box is [2, 3] × [0, 2],
x's bounding box is [2, 3] × [3, 4].
- Is x N of y? Yes, x is above y.
- Is y SE of z? Yes, y is to the southeast of z.
- Is x SE of z? Yes, x is to the southeast of z.

OK, so it does look like all three relations (NE, E, SE) are possible.

Let me also check the single-tile (basic) cardinal directions definitions to convince myself further, and ensure I'm not missing anything.

1. NE relation: a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
2. E relation: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
3. SE relation: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Oh wait, I'm getting confused with the a's and b's. To clarify, in our problem we're asking whether x NE z, x E z, or x SE z. So we're asking if:

1. NE relation: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
2. E relation: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
3. SE relation: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x) from our prior reasoning. So, NE, E, and SE are all possible if the respective additional constraints are met. And as I've shown with the examples, all three are possible.

Let me double-check our reasoning for the E relation:

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): We've established this already.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): This means the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): This means the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z.

From the second constraint, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y): y is to the east of z.
- supy(y) <= infy(z): y is to the south of z.

Combining supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) gives us no direct information about infy(z) relative to infy(x).

Actually, I think my approach is getting overly complex. Let me try a cleaner approach.

**Approach**:
We are given:
* x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
* y is SE of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

From these, we've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.

Now, we need to see where x is positioned in relation to the y-coordinates of z.

Northness in the cardinal direction is captured by supy(z) <= infy(x). From the given constraints, we don't have direct implications on supy(z) in relation to infy(x).

Directness in the E direction is captured by infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). From the given constraints, we don't have direct implications on these relations.

Southerness is captured by supy(x) <= infy(z). From the given constraints, we don't have direct implications on supy(x) in relation to infy(z).

So, without additional constraints, all relations where x is to the east of z are possible. These are NE, E, and SE. I've provided examples for each to show they're all valid.

Additional consideration: Could x be related to z in any other ways, such as B, S, SW, W, NW, or N?

Let's check:
- B: For x B z, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But from the constraints, we've shown that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the necessary condition for B. Hence, x B z is impossible.

- S: For x S z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). From the constraints, we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z) for S. Hence, x S z is impossible.

- SW: For x SW z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But supx(z) <= infx(x) implies infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) for SW. Hence, x SW z is impossible.

- W: For x W z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Similar to the reasoning for SW, we have a contradiction due to supx(z) <= infx(x). Hence, x W z is impossible.

- NW: For x NW z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Similarly, there's a contradiction due to supx(z) <= infx(x). Hence, x NW z is impossible.

- N: For x N z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But once again, the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z) for N. Hence, x N z is impossible.

Summarizing, the only possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE.

Alright, so the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is N of y and y is SE of z, are:
1. NE (Northeast): If x is to the northeast of z.
2. E (East): If x is directly to the east of z.
3. SE (Southeast): If x is to the southeast of z.

Actually, I'm still having a doubt about whether the SE relation is possible. Let's trace through an example again.

Suppose z is at the origin (0, 0) and extends to (1, 4). Also, let y be at (2, 0) and extend to (3, 1). Then, if x is at (2, 2) and extends to (3, 3), then x is N of y, and y is SE of z.

Let's check the relations:
- z is at (0, 0) to (1, 4), so infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 4.
- y is at (2, 0) to (3, 1), so infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 0, supy(y) = 1.
- x is at (2, 2) to (3, 3), so infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3.

Is x N of y? Yes, supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, and infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2, and supx(x) = 3 <= supx(y) = 3.
Is y SE of z? Yes, supx(z) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2, and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(z) = 0 (wait, this is wrong). Hold on, for y to be SE of z, we need supy(y) <= infy(z), which would mean 1 <= 0, which is false. So this breaks our example. Let me retry.

Suppose z is at (0, 4) and extends to (1, 5). Also, let y be at (2, 0) and extend to (3, 1). Then, if x is at (2, 2) and extends to (3, 3), Is y SE of z? We have supy(y) = 1, infy(z) = 4. Now supy(y) <= infy(z) since 1 <= 4. So, y is SE of z.

Now, is x SE of z? For this to be true, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), which is 1 <= 2, so that's fine. And also, supy(x) <= infy(z), which is 3 <= 4, so this also checks out. So, x is SE of z in this example.

But wait, do these regions satisfy our original constraints? Let's double-check.

Is x N of y? Yes, supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, and infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2, and supx(x) = 3 <= supx(y) = 3.
Is y SE of z? Yes, supx(z) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2, and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(z) = 4.

So both constraints hold, and x is SE of z. So the SE relation is possible as well.

In conclusion, the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is N of y and y is SE of z, are:
1. NE (Northeast): If x is to the northeast of z.
2. E (East): If x is directly to the east of z.
3. SE (Southeast): If x is to the southeast of z.

ANSWER:

Based on the constraints that region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y, meaning: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is SE of z, meaning: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, I can derive that:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x is always to the east of z

The y-coordinate relationship between x and z can vary:
1. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x): x is NE of z
2. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z): x is E of z
3. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is SE of z

All three scenarios are possible while maintaining the original constraints.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, SE
