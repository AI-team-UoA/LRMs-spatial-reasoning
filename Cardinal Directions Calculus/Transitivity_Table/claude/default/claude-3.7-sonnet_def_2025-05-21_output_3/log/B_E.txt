PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the situation:
- Region x is B of region y, meaning x is inside the bounding box of y.
- Region y is E of region z, meaning y is to the east of z.

We need to find all possible relations between regions x and z.

When x is B of y, that means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

When y is E of z, that means:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z using these constraints.

From x B y and y E z, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), so supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x). This means x is strictly to the east of z, which means x could be E, NE, or SE of z.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z, which is consistent with E relationship.

Let's check each of the potential relationships:

1. x E z? 
   For x to be E of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Already established)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (Already established)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (Already established)
   So, x could be E of z.

2. x NE z?
   For x to be NE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Already established)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   This is not guaranteed by our given constraints. In fact, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), but we don't know where supy(z) is in relation to infy(x).
   So, x could potentially be NE of z, but we need to check if this is consistent with all constraints.

3. x SE z?
   For x to be SE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Already established)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   This is not consistent with our established constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x). If infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then it's not possible for supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (as a region's infy is always less than or equal to its supy).
   So, x cannot be SE of z.

4. x N z?
   For x to be N of z, we need:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x is strictly to the east of z. This contradicts the condition for x to be N of z, which requires x to be aligned with z in the x-direction.
   So, x cannot be N of z.

5. x S z?
   Similarly to N, this requires alignment in the x-direction, which is contradicted by our established constraint.
   So, x cannot be S of z.

6. x W z?
   This contradicts our established constraint that x is to the east of z.
   So, x cannot be W of z.

7. x NW z?
   This contradicts our established constraint that x is to the east of z.
   So, x cannot be NW of z.

8. x SW z?
   This contradicts our established constraint that x is to the east of z.
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

9. x B z?
   For x to be B of z, we need:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   We've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) for x to be B of z.
   So, x cannot be B of z.

Wait, let's rethink the NE and E cases again. We know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Satisfied)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (Not guaranteed)

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (Satisfied)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (Satisfied)

So, from our constraints, we can say for sure that x can be E of z. However, for x to be NE of z, we need an additional constraint: supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Hmm, actually, I think I might have been making a mistake in my analysis of the NE case. Let's reconsider. For x to be NE of z, there must be no overlap in either the x or y projections. The constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ensures there's no overlap in the y-projection. Given that we've established supx(z) ≤ infx(x), there's no overlap in the x-projection.

Our established constraints tell us:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These suggest that the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z, which contradicts the constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) needed for x to be NE of z.

So, from our given constraints, x can only be E of z.

Wait, let me make sure I'm correctly interpreting the constraint y E z. According to the problem definition:

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

So, if y E z, then:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let's revisit our constraints:
- From x B y:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

- From y E z:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
  - supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x is strictly to the east of z.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means the bottom edge of x is above the bottom edge of z.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means the top edge of x is below the top edge of z.

The last two constraints suggest that the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z, which is consistent with the E relationship and inconsistent with the NE or SE relationships.

So, based on our constraints, I'm confident that x can only be E of z.

Actually, we have to be more careful. The constraints I listed don't guarantee that y is E of z or x is B of y. They only provide necessary conditions.

For y to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These are the constraints that must be satisfied, but there are other configurations where these constraints are met but y is not strictly E of z (because, for example, y might also extend northward or southward beyond the y-projection of z).

Similarly, for x to be B of y, the constraints must be satisfied, but there are other configurations where x is not strictly contained within the bounding box of y (because, for example, x might be exactly the same shape and size as y).

Given that, I should reconsider the possible relationships between x and z based on the constraints, not just the idealized E and B relationships.

Let's go back to the constraints:
- From x B y:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

- From y E z:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
  - supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x is strictly to the east of z.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From the second and third combined constraints, I just know that the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z, and the top edge of x is below or at the same level as the top edge of z. This means the y-projection of x might be fully contained within the y-projection of z (consistent with E), might be above the y-projection of z (consistent with NE), or might be below the y-projection of z (consistent with SE).

Actually, can x be above z? That is, could it be true that x NE z? For this to happen, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But from our combined constraints we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

So we have infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is the opposite of what we need for x to be above z. The constraints infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) suggest that either x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection, or they overlap partially.

Similarly, can x be below z? That is, could x SE z? For this to happen, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But from our constraints, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x). This means infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z), given that infy(x) ≤ supy(x) for any region x.

So, I think x can't be NE or SE of z given our constraints.

Let me recheck the constraints for x to be E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Satisfied from our combined constraints)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (Satisfied from our combined constraints)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (Satisfied from our combined constraints)

So, based on our combined constraints, I believe x can be E of z.

Wait, let me check one thing more carefully: The constraint on y is "y E z". And the constraint on x is "x B y". These are single-tile relations. So each of x and y must be in exactly one of the nine tiles relative to the other region, not spread across multiple tiles. This means that y is strictly E of z, and x is strictly B of y.

Given these constraints, I now need to determine, where x is in the 9 tiles relative to z. From the constraints, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

The first constraint definitely places x to the east of z. The second and third constraints do not fully determine the north-south relationship between x and z. Let's consider the possibilities:

1. x E z: For this, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Satisfied)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (Satisfied)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (Satisfied)
   The constraints we've derived from the problem satisfy all the requirements for x to be E of z. So, x can be E of z.

2. x NE z: For this, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Satisfied)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   Our derived constraints include infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). These don't guarantee supy(z) ≤ infy(x). In fact, they're compatible with situations where the y-projections of x and z overlap, which would mean x is not NE of z.
   
   But, the constraints are also compatible with supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would make x NE of z. So, x can be NE of z.

3. x SE z: For this, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Satisfied)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   Our derived constraints include infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(z) ≤ infy(x). For any region, infy(region) ≤ supy(region). This means infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) ≤ infy(z) for x to be SE of z.
   So, x cannot be SE of z.

Given the constraints we've established, and considering all possible single-tile relations, I think x can be E or NE of z.

Actually, let me ensure this is correct by thinking through it differently.

Given:
- x B y: x is inside the bounding box of y.
- y E z: y is to the east of z.

If y is E of z, then y is strictly to the east of z, not overlapping in the x-direction. Now, x, being B of y, is inside the bounding box of y. This means x is within the x and y extents of y, but it doesn't mean x is strictly smaller than y in both dimensions; they could share boundaries.

Given that y is strictly to the east of z, and x is within the bounding box of y, the leftmost point of x is to the east of z (because the leftmost point of y is to the east of z). So, x is also to the east of z (in the sense that it's strictly to the east, not overlapping in the x-direction).

Now, for the north-south relationship, since y E z, the y-projection of y is contained within the y-projection of z. And since x B y, the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y. This means the y-projection of x is also contained within the y-projection of z.

So, from the constraints, I can deduce that x is strictly to the east of z, and the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z. This perfectly aligns with the E relation. So, x E z.

But wait, I think I'm being too strict and forgetting about the possibility of variations.

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From these, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (Satisfied)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (Satisfied)

So, x can be E of z. Can x be in any other relation to z?

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Satisfied)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The constraints we've derived don't impose any condition on the relation between supy(z) and infy(x). So, it's possible for supy(z) to be less than or equal to infy(x).

However, we do know that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If infy(x) > supy(z), it means infy(y) > supy(z) as well. But then, supy(y) ≤ supy(z) implies supy(y) < infy(y), which is impossible for a valid region.

I now realize that the NE relation is not possible because of this contradiction. If we try to place x such that its y-projection is above z, it would imply y's y-projection is also above z, which contradicts the condition for y E z.

Similarly, for x to be SE of z, we'd need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Hmm, I think the issue in my previous analysis is that I was not properly accounting for the constraints implied by the spatial relationships. Let me approach this again, taking into account the fact that regions must be valid (i.e., infy(region) ≤ supy(region)).

Let's see. From x B y and y E z, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). If this were the case, then supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) would imply supy(x) ≤ infy(x), which is impossible for a valid region x.

So, x cannot be NE of z.

Similarly, for x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But we have infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and infy(x) ≤ supy(x) (for any valid region), which means infy(z) ≤ supy(x), contradicting the requirement for SE.

So, x cannot be SE of z.

I've verified that my original conclusion is correct: x can only be E of z.

Wait, I might have been too restrictive with my constraints. Let me go back to the definitions.

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Let me be a bit more careful this time. Suppose that we want to have x NE z. Now, for that to be true we'd need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

We know from x B y and y E z that:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (So this is satisifed)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (This just tells us that the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (This tells us that the top edge of x is below or at the same level as the top edge of z)

In order for x NE z, we also need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Hmm, but we have supy(x) ≤ supy(z), and in any valid region infy(x) ≤ supy(x). So we have infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which gives infy(x) ≤ supy(z), which is the opposite of what we want.

So we can rule out the possibility of x NE z. 

Using a similar logic, for x to be SE z, we would need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

We know the first is satisfied. For the second, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(z) ≤ infy(x). For any valid region, infy(x) ≤ supy(x). So, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

So we can rule out the possibility of x SE z.

I'll think about the possibility of x NE z one more time. For this to be true, we'd need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (Satisfied from our combined constraints)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our combined constraints, we know:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

To have x NE z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). That's not directly implied by our constraints. Let's see, we have infy(x) ≥ infy(y) ≥ infy(z) and supy(z) ≥ supy(y) ≥ supy(x). For a valid region, infy(x) ≤ supy(x). So, infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which implies infy(x) ≤ supy(z). This is the opposite of what we need for x NE z.

So, x NE z is ruled out.

Similarly, for x SE z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But from our constraints, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

OK, so the possibilities for x in relation to z are restricted to E.

Wait a minute. Let me carefully go through the exercises one last time. We know that: 

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Let me try a slightly different approach. I'll be a bit more careful and I'll restate the constraints differently to make sure I get a consistent picture. From x B y and y E z, we get:

1. From y E z, we know y is strictly to the east of z. From x B y, we know x is contained within the bounding box of y. This means x must also be to the east of z. So, x is east of z (in the x-direction).

2. From y E z, we know the y-projection of y is contained within the y-projection of z. From x B y, we know the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y. This means the y-projection of x is also contained within the y-projection of z. So, x is aligned with z (in the y-direction).

Given that x is east of z (in the x-direction) and aligned with z (in the y-direction), the only possible relation is x E z.

I think that's a simpler way to check the result. And the answer is the same as what I concluded earlier.

Actually, I'm worried I'm not being careful enough. Let me revisit the meaning of the two relations given x B y and y E z:

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x). This means that x is strictly to the east of z, so x has to be in one of the eastern regions. However, the exact easter region (E, NE, SE) depends on the north-south relation.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x). This means that the bottom edge of x is above the bottom edge of z.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means that the top edge of x is below the top edge of z.

Combining the constraints, the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z. This, along with x being strictly to the east of z, means x E z.

But I'm now realizing that there's another possibility. First, I should note how the nine tiles are defined. I got a bit confused earlier. Let me make sure I'm clear.

Consider the minimum bounding box of a region b, and divide it into 9 (potentially 8 after removing the internal tile, which is labeled B for "bounding box") areas using horizontal and vertical lines through the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of b. This divides the plane into 9 areas, labeled NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE. I understand.

A single-tile cardinal direction relation like "S" means that a region a is entirely in the "S" area of region b.

Ok, now, let's restate:
For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is strictly to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (The bottom edge of y is above the bottom edge of z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (The top edge of y is below the top edge of z)

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (The left edge of x is to the right of the left edge of y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (The right edge of x is to the left of the right edge of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (The bottom edge of x is above the bottom edge of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (The top edge of x is below the top edge of y)

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (The left edge of x is to the right of the right edge of z, so x is strictly to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (The bottom edge of x is above the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (The top edge of x is below the top edge of z)

The key insights are that x is strictly to the east of z, the bottom edge of x is above the bottom edge of z, and the top edge of x is below the top edge of z. This means the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z, which is the y-condition for the E relation. Combined with the fact that x is strictly to the east of z, we have x E z.

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating things. Let's simplify: x B y means x is inside the bounding box of y. y E z means y is to the east of z. So, y is to the east of z, and x is inside the bounding box of y. Since y is to the east of z, its bounding box is also to the east of z. Since x is inside the bounding box of y, x is also to the east of z. To determine the exact relation, we need to check the north-south alignment.

y E z means the y-projection of y is contained within the y-projection of z. x B y means the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y. Therefore, the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z. Since x is strictly to the east of z and the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z, the relation is x E z.

I'm now pretty confident that the answer is E.

Wait, I want to try one more approach to double check. Let's think of specific examples for x, y, and z that satisfy the constraints.

Consider:
- z = {(0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 4), (2, 0)}
- y = {(3, 1), (3, 3), (5, 3), (5, 1)}
- x = {(4, 2), (4, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2)}

z is a rectangle, and y is a rectangle to the east of z. x is a small rectangle inside y. In this case, x is to the east of z.

Now, let's try a slightly different example:
- z = {(0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 4), (2, 0)}
- y = {(3, 0), (3, 4), (5, 4), (5, 0)}
- x = {(4, 0), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 0)}

Here, y's y-projection matches z, and x's right edge matches y's right edge. Again, x is to the east of z.

Let's try another:
- z = {(0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 4), (2, 0)}
- y = {(3, 1), (3, 3), (5, 3), (5, 1)}
- x = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1)}

Here, x's left edge matches y's left edge. Again, x is to the east of z.

It seems, regardless of the specific configuration within the constraints, x is always to the east of z, which aligns with the relation x E z.

OK, so to summarize, I'm pretty confident that the answer is E.

Actually, I want to try a few more test cases, but being now a bit more careful. Let me go back to the conditions again:

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Let's think of what x B y requires:

x B y  <=> x is in the bounding box of y. <=> infx(y) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(y) AND infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y)

What is the weakest instance of x B y? x is the same as y, so x = y. In that case, x has the same shape, size, and position as y. If y is east of z, then x would also be east of z.

Let's try a different instance, where x is smaller and entirely inside y:
- z = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 1)}
- y = {(4, 1.5), (4, 2.5), (6, 2.5), (6, 1.5)}
- x = {(4.5, 1.75), (4.5, 2.25), (5.5, 2.25), (5.5, 1.75)}

In this case:
- infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 1.5, supy(y) = 2.5
- infx(x) = 4.5, supx(x) = 5.5, infy(x) = 1.75, supy(x) = 2.25

Checking the constraints:
- For y E z: 
  - supx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 4 (Satisfied)
  - infy(z) = 1 ≤ infy(y) = 1.5 (Satisfied)
  - supy(y) = 2.5 ≤ supy(z) = 3 (Satisfied)
- For x B y:
  - infx(y) = 4 ≤ infx(x) = 4.5 (Satisfied)
  - supx(x) = 5.5 ≤ supx(y) = 6 (Satisfied)
  - infy(y) = 1.5 ≤ infy(x) = 1.75 (Satisfied)
  - supy(x) = 2.25 ≤ supy(y) = 2.5 (Satisfied)

What's the relation between x and z in this case?
- supx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(x) = 4.5 (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) = 1 ≤ infy(x) = 1.75 (The bottom edge of x is above the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) = 2.25 ≤ supy(z) = 3 (The top edge of x is below the top edge of z)

This aligns with the relation x E z.

Let's try another instance, pushing the constraints to their limits:
- z = {(1, 1), (1, 5), (3, 5), (3, 1)}
- y = {(3, 2), (3, 4), (7, 4), (7, 2)}
- x = {(3, 2), (3, 4), (6, 4), (6, 2)}

In this case:
- infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 5
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 7, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4
- infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 6, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4

Checking the constraints:
- For y E z: 
  - supx(z) = 3 = infx(y) = 3 (Satisfied)
  - infy(z) = 1 ≤ infy(y) = 2 (Satisfied)
  - supy(y) = 4 ≤ supy(z) = 5 (Satisfied)
- For x B y:
  - infx(y) = 3 = infx(x) = 3 (Satisfied)
  - supx(x) = 6 ≤ supx(y) = 7 (Satisfied)
  - infy(y) = 2 = infy(x) = 2 (Satisfied)
  - supy(x) = 4 = supy(y) = 4 (Satisfied)

What's the relation between x and z in this case?
- supx(z) = 3 = infx(x) = 3 (x is to the east of z) (this is at the boundary of the constraint)
- infy(z) = 1 ≤ infy(x) = 2 (The bottom edge of x is above the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) = 4 ≤ supy(z) = 5 (The top edge of x is below the top edge of z)

Again, this aligns with the relation x E z.

I think I need to be a bit more careful about the constraints and how they're defined, since I keep making a mistake somewhere.

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Let's be extra specific about what these mean.

For y E z:
- The greatest x-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the smallest x-coordinate of y. This ensures that y is strictly to the east of z.
- The smallest y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the smallest y-coordinate of y. This ensures that the bottom edge of y is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z.
- The greatest y-coordinate of y is less than or equal to the greatest y-coordinate of z. This ensures that the top edge of y is below or at the same level as the top edge of z.

For x B y:
- The smallest x-coordinate of y is less than or equal to the smallest x-coordinate of x. This ensures that the left edge of x is to the right or at the same level as the left edge of y.
- The greatest x-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the greatest x-coordinate of y. This ensures that the right edge of x is to the left or at the same level as the right edge of y.
- The smallest y-coordinate of y is less than or equal to the smallest y-coordinate of x. This ensures that the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of y.
- The greatest y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the greatest y-coordinate of y. This ensures that the top edge of x is below or at the same level as the top edge of y.

From these, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x). This means the greatest x-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the smallest x-coordinate of x, i.e. x is strictly to the east of z.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x). This means the smallest y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the smallest y-coordinate of x, i.e., the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means the greatest y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the greatest y-coordinate of z, i.e., the top edge of x is below or at the same level as the top edge of z.

These constraints collectively mean that x is strictly to the east of z, and the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z. This is the definition of the E relation.

So I'm confident now: the answer is that x is E of z.

Actually, let me try to be a bit more careful, since I do keep making a mistake. The constraints on the regions x, y, and z are:

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is strictly to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (the bottom edge of y is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (the top edge of y is below or at the same level as the top edge of z)

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the east or at the same level as the left edge of y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the west or at the same level as the right edge of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is to the north or at the same level as the bottom edge of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (the top edge of x is to the south or at the same level as the top edge of y)

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is strictly to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is to the north or at the same level as the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (the top edge of x is to the south or at the same level as the top edge of z)

Let's check if these constraints imply any of the cardinal direction relations:

1. x E z: For this, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is strictly to the east of z) (Satisfied from our combined constraints)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is to the north or at the same level as the bottom edge of z) (Satisfied from our combined constraints)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (the top edge of x is to the south or at the same level as the top edge of z) (Satisfied from our combined constraints)
   So, x can be E of z.

2. x NE z: For this, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is strictly to the east of z) (Satisfied from our combined constraints)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly to the north of z)
   The constraints we've derived don't directly give us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x). We know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), but this doesn't tell us about supy(z) in relation to infy(x).
   So, we can't rule out x NE z, but we need additional constraints. Actually, we can rule it out! We know supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), i.e., supy(x) ≤ supy(z). For any valid region, infy(x) ≤ supy(x). So, infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which means infy(x) ≤ supy(z). This is the opposite of what we need for x NE z, which is supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

3. x SE z: For this, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is strictly to the east of z) (Satisfied from our combined constraints)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is strictly to the south of z)
   From our derived constraints, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(z) ≤ infy(x). For any valid region, infy(x) ≤ supy(x). So, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which means infy(z) ≤ supy(x). This is the opposite of what we need for x SE z, which is supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x cannot be SE of z.

4. x N z: For this, we need:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly to the north of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the east or at the same level as the left edge of z)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the west or at the same level as the right edge of z)
   From our combined constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ supx(z) for x N z. So, x cannot be N of z.

5. x S z: For this, we need:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is strictly to the south of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the east or at the same level as the left edge of z)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the west or at the same level as the right edge of z)
   From our combined constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ supx(z) for x S z. So, x cannot be S of z.

6. x W z: For this, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is strictly to the west of z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is to the north or at the same level as the bottom edge of z)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (the top edge of x is to the south or at the same level as the top edge of z)
   From our combined constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for x W z. So, x cannot be W of z.

7. x NW z: For this, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is strictly to the west of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly to the north of z)
   From our combined constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for x NW z. So, x cannot be NW of z.

8. x SW z: For this, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is strictly to the west of z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is strictly to the south of z)
   From our combined constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for x SW z. So, x cannot be SW of z.

9. x B z: For this, we need:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the east or at the same level as the left edge of z)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the west or at the same level as the right edge of z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is to the north or at the same level as the bottom edge of z)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (the top edge of x is to the south or at the same level as the top edge of z)
   From our combined constraints, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). For any valid region, infx(x) ≤ supx(x). So, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ supx(z) for x B z. So, x cannot be B of z.

After checking all nine cardinal direction relations, I've found that only x E z is consistent with the constraints derived from x B y and y E z. So, the only possible relation between x and z is E.

So my answer is that x E z.

ANSWER:

Given the constraints:
- Region x is B of region y: This means x is inside the bounding box of y.
- Region y is E of region z: This means y is strictly to the east of z.

Let me analyze the possible relations between x and z by examining the constraints:

For x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For y E z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x): This means x is strictly to the east of z
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x): The bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z): The top edge of x is below or at the same level as the top edge of z

This configuration satisfies exactly the definition of the E relation: x is strictly to the east of z, and the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z.

Therefore, E is the only possible relation between region x and region z.
