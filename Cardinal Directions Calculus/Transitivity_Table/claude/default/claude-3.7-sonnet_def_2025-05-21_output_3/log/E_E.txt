PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step. We have:
- x E y: Region x is East of region y
- y E z: Region y is East of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions:
- x E y means: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y E z means: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's consider what these constraints tell us about the possible relation between x and z.

From x E y, we know:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (y extends at least as far south as x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (y extends at least as far north as x)

From y E z, we know:
4. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
5. infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
6. supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Now, to find the relation between x and z, let's see what we can deduce:

From (1) and (4), we get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
This simplifies to: supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z. This satisfies the first condition for x E z, x NE z, or x SE z.

Now, let's check the north-south relationship:

From (2) and (5), we get: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
This means z extends at least as far south as x.

From (3) and (6), we get: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
This means z extends at least as far north as x.

So, combining all these constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends at least as far south as x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as x)

These are exactly the conditions for x E z. So one possible relation is x E z.

But let's check if any other relations are possible. 

For x NE z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which means z is entirely to the south of x)

For this to be true, we would need z to be entirely to the south of x. From our derived constraints, we only know that z extends at least as far south as x and at least as far north as x. It's possible that z extends further north than x (i.e., supy(z) > supy(x)). However, we don't know if z is entirely to the south of x. So, we can't conclusively say if x NE z is a possible relation.

Let me re-analyze this. 

We know:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

For x NE z to be true, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But from our constraints, we know infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x NE z is not a possible relation.

For x SE z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which means x is entirely to the south of z)

For this to be true, we would need x to be entirely to the south of z. From our derived constraints, we know that supy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x). For x SE z to be true, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But this contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). So, x SE z is not a possible relation.

Let's continue checking other relations:

For x B z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which means z extends at least as far west as x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which means z extends at least as far east as x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which means z extends at least as far south as x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which means z extends at least as far north as x)

From our derived constraints, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is entirely to the west of x. This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) for x B z. So, x B z is not a possible relation.

For x S z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which means x is entirely to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which means z extends at least as far west as x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which means z extends at least as far east as x)

From our derived constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x S z is not a possible relation.

For x SW z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which means x is entirely to the west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which means x is entirely to the south of z)

From our derived constraints, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is entirely to the east of z. This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x SW z. So, x SW z is not a possible relation.

For x W z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which means x is entirely to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which means z extends at least as far south as x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which means z extends at least as far north as x)

From our derived constraints, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is entirely to the east of z. This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x W z. So, x W z is not a possible relation.

For x NW z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which means x is entirely to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which means x is entirely to the north of z)

From our derived constraints, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is entirely to the east of z. This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x NW z. So, x NW z is not a possible relation.

For x N z, we would need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which means x is entirely to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which means z extends at least as far west as x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which means z extends at least as far east as x)

From our derived constraints, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is entirely to the east of z. This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) for x N z. So, x N z is not a possible relation.

Actually, I realize I've made a mistake. The fact that supx(z) <= infx(x) only tells us that x is to the east of z to some extent, but doesn't tell us about the entire region. Let me be more careful in my analysis.

From x E y, we know:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (y extends at least as far south as x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (y extends at least as far north as x)

From y E z, we know:
4. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
5. infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
6. supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

From (1) and (4), we get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
This simplifies to: supx(z) <= infx(x).

From (2) and (5), we get: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
This simplifies to: infy(z) <= infy(x).

From (3) and (6), we get: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).
This simplifies to: supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now, let's check if the conditions for each cardinal direction relation are satisfied:

For x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've established)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we've established)

All conditions for x E z are met, so x E z is a possible relation.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which means z is entirely to the south of x)

Given our constraints, we know:
infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends at least as far south as x)
supy(x) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as x)

Let's consider if there's a possible arrangement where supy(z) <= infy(x). Since regions are connected, and for any region r, infy(r) <= supy(r), we know that infy(x) <= supy(x). Combining with our constraints, we get: infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z).

For supy(z) <= infy(x) to be true, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This is only possible if supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z), which is a degenerate case where both x and z are essentially horizontal lines. In most cases, this wouldn't be a valid relation, so x NE z is not a common possible relation based on our constraints.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which means x is entirely to the south of z)

Given our constraints, we know:
infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends at least as far south as x)
supy(x) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as x)

For supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true, and considering infy(z) <= infy(x) (from our constraints), we would need supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies supy(x) <= infy(x). This is not possible for a valid region, as for any region r, infy(r) <= supy(r). So, x SE z is not a possible relation.

For x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which means z extends at least as far west as x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which means z extends at least as far east as x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've established)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we've established)

Given our constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is entirely to the west of x. This contradicts the conditions infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) for x B z. So, x B z is not a possible relation.

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which means x is entirely to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which means z extends at least as far west as x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which means z extends at least as far east as x)

Given our constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is entirely to the west of x. This contradicts the conditions infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) for x S z. So, x S z is not a possible relation.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which means x is entirely to the west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which means x is entirely to the south of z)

Given our constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is entirely to the east of z. This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x SW z. So, x SW z is not a possible relation.

For x W z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which means x is entirely to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've established)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we've established)

Given our constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is entirely to the east of z. This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x W z. So, x W z is not a possible relation.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which means x is entirely to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which means x is entirely to the north of z)

Given our constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is entirely to the east of z. This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for x NW z. So, x NW z is not a possible relation.

For x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which means x is entirely to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which means z extends at least as far west as x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which means z extends at least as far east as x)

Given our constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is entirely to the west of x. This contradicts the conditions infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) for x N z. So, x N z is not a possible relation.

I think I'm still being overly restrictive. Let me analyze this problem more carefully.

Given:
- x E y: Region x is East of region y
- y E z: Region y is East of region z

From the definition of the E relation:
- x E y means: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y E z means: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (from y E z and the transitivity of <=)
   This means z is to the west of x.

2. infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y E z and x E y)
   This means z extends at least as far south as x.

3. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from x E y and y E z)
   This means z extends at least as far north as x.

Now, let's check if the conditions for each cardinal direction relation are satisfied:

For x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (derived from 1)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (derived from 2)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (derived from 3)

All three conditions are met, so x E z is a possible relation.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (derived from 1)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z must be entirely south of x)

From our derived constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends at least as far south as x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as x). For x NE z to be true, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But this contradicts both infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is true for any region) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (from our derived constraints). So, x NE z is not a possible relation unless in degenerate cases.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (derived from 1)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x must be entirely south of z)

From our derived constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends at least as far south as x). For x SE z to be true, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But this contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) (combining the derived constraint with the general property of regions). So, x SE z is not a possible relation unless in degenerate cases.

Actually, I realize I need to think about this more carefully. Our constraints (like infy(z) <= infy(x)) don't mean that z "extends at least as far south as x" unconditionally. They just mean that the infimum (lower bound) of z's y-coordinates is less than or equal to the infimum of x's y-coordinates. This doesn't tell us the full extent of the regions, only the bounds.

Let me represent the regions in a more intuitive way:

Region z: bounded by the box with corners at (infx(z), infy(z)) and (supx(z), supy(z))
Region y: bounded by the box with corners at (infx(y), infy(y)) and (supx(y), supy(y))
Region x: bounded by the box with corners at (infx(x), infy(x)) and (supx(x), supy(x))

Now, given:
- x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We can derive:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (from y E z and the transitivity of <=)
2. infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y E z and x E y)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from x E y and y E z)

Alright, when supx(z) <= infx(x), this means that the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. In other words, the regions x and z are horizontally separated, with z to the west of x. This is one of the conditions for the cardinal directions E, NE, and SE.

Looking at the y-direction, from our derived constraints, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This means that the bottom edge of z is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of x, and the top edge of z is above or at the same level as the top edge of x. In other words, z "contains" x in the y-direction.

Given these constraints, the only cardinal direction relation that satisfies all these conditions is x E z. This is because x E z requires:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (horizontally separated, z to the west of x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (z's bottom edge is below or at the same level as x's bottom edge)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (z's top edge is above or at the same level as x's top edge)

All other cardinal direction relations would contradict one or more of these conditions.

However, I need to be careful because the constraints derived from the given conditions only provide bounds on the regions. The actual regions could have shapes that make other relations possible.

Let's double-check each relation:

For x NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (derived from 1, so this is satisfied)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z must be entirely south of x)

From our derived constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) (since infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region). So, x NE z is not a possible relation.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (derived from 1, so this is satisfied)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x must be entirely south of z)

From our derived constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (since infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region). So, x SE z is not a possible relation.

For x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (z must extend at least as far west as x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (z must extend at least as far east as x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (derived from 2, so this is satisfied)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (derived from 3, so this is satisfied)

From our derived constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts both infx(z) <= infx(x) (z extends at least as far west as x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as x). So, x B z is not a possible relation.

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x must be entirely south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (z must extend at least as far west as x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (z must extend at least as far east as x)

From our derived constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (since infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region). Moreover, since supx(z) <= infx(x), z is entirely to the west of x, which contradicts the conditions for x S z. So, x S z is not a possible relation.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x must be entirely west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x must be entirely south of z)

From our derived constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (since infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region). So, x SW z is not a possible relation.

For x W z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x must be entirely west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (derived from 2, so this is satisfied)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (derived from 3, so this is satisfied)

From our derived constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (since infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region). So, x W z is not a possible relation.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x must be entirely west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z must be entirely south of x)

From our derived constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (since infx(z) <= supx(z) for any region). Moreover, since supy(x) <= supy(z), z's top edge is above or at the same level as x's top edge, which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x NW z is not a possible relation.

For x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z must be entirely south of x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (z must extend at least as far west as x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (z must extend at least as far east as x)

From our derived constraints, we know supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) (since infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region). Moreover, since supx(z) <= infx(x), z is entirely to the west of x, which contradicts the conditions for x N z. So, x N z is not a possible relation.

Upon reviewing all the possible cardinal direction relations, I conclude that based on the given constraints, the only possible relation between region x and region z is x E z (East). This means that if region x is East of region y and region y is East of region z, then region x is East of region z.

This aligns with our intuitive understanding of the East direction: if A is to the east of B, and B is to the east of C, then A is to the east of C. The mathematical formulation confirms this intuition.

Ok, so the possible relation between x and z is:
E

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- x E y (x is East of y)
- y E z (y is East of z)

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relation(s) between x and z.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y extends at least as far south as x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y extends at least as far north as x)

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Combining these constraints:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means z is to the west of x
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means z extends at least as far south as x
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means z extends at least as far north as x

These three conditions precisely match the definition of x E z.

The answer is: E
