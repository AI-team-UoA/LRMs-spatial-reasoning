PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

I need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let me recall the definitions:

x W y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the west of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's south edge is not below y's south edge)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's north edge is not above y's north edge)

y SE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is entirely to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is entirely to the south of z)

Now, let's analyze what these constraints tell us about the relationship between x and z.

From x W y:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y SE z:
4. supx(z) <= infx(y)
5. supy(y) <= infy(z)

First, let's see what we can deduce about the x-coordinates:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from 1)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from 4)

These don't directly give us a constraint between x and z along the x-axis. Both x and z are to the west of y, but they could be in various configurations relative to each other.

Now, let's see what we can deduce about the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from 2)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 3)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from 5)

Combining 3 and 5, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z)

This means that x is entirely to the south of z (vertically, x is below z).

So, we know:
- x could be to the west or southwest or south of z, depending on the x-coordinates

Now, let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z based on this:

1. S (South): If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z)
2. SW (South West): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
3. W (West): If supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's check if each of these is possible:

1. S (South): 
   - We know supy(x) <= infy(z), so the y-condition for S is satisfied.
   - The x-condition (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) is about x being within the x-range of z. Given the constraints, this is possible if x and z overlap in their x-projections.

2. SW (South West):
   - We know supy(x) <= infy(z), so the y-condition for SW is satisfied.
   - The x-condition (supx(x) <= infx(z)) is about x being entirely to the west of z. Given the constraints, this is possible if x is to the west of both y and z.

3. W (West):
   - The y-condition (infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)) requires x's y-range to be within z's y-range.
   - However, we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. This contradicts the y-condition for W. Therefore, W is not a possible relation.

Actually, let me rethink this to be sure. The constraints are:

Given:
- Region x is W of region y (supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y))
- Region y is SE of region z (supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z))

Let's analyze:

From x W y, we know x is to the west of y. From y SE z, we know y is to the southeast of z.

For the east-west relationship:
- x is to the west of y, and y is to the east of z.
- This suggests x can be to the west of z, but it's not a strict constraint.

For the north-south relationship:
- x's vertical extent is within y's vertical extent.
- y is entirely to the south of z.
- This suggests x is to the south of z, but again, it's not a strict constraint.

Actually, I believe I was overcomplicating this. Let's use a more direct approach.

We have the positions of x, y, and z in relation to each other. Let's visualize this:

z is in the NW.
y is in the SE of z.
x is to the W of y.

Given this layout, x must be to the southwest or west or south of z. It cannot be to the north, northeast, east, or southeast of z because x is to the west of y, and y is to the southeast of z. Additionally, x cannot be within the bounding box (B) of z or to the northwest of z due to the given constraints.

Now, to check each possible cardinal direction:

1. W (West): x can be to the west of z, aligning with z in a vertical band.
2. SW (Southwest): x can be to the southwest of z if it's both to the west and south of z.
3. S (South): x can be to the south of z, aligning with z in a horizontal band.
4. NW (Northwest): For x to be to the northwest of z, it needs to be to the north and west of z. But since y is to the southeast of z, and x is to the west of y, x would be to the south of z. So, NW is not possible.

Hmm, let me double-check NW, because I think I might be wrong.
x W y means x is to the west of y and vertically aligned with y (i.e., x's vertical extent is within y's vertical extent).
y SE z means y is to the southeast of z.

If y is at the southeast of z, and x is to the west of y, then x can indeed be to the northwest of z. It depends on how far north x extends compared to z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
W, SW, S, and potentially NW.

Let me double-check once more: I think I'm still confusing myself.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Let's go back to the definitions:

x W y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the west of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's south edge is not below y's south edge)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's north edge is not above y's north edge)

y SE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is entirely to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is entirely to the south of z)

Let's think about the east-west relationship of x and z:
From the constraints, we know that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y). This means both x and z are to the west of y. But, it doesn't give us a direct constraint between x and z along the east-west axis. They can be in various configurations relative to each other.

Now, let's consider the north-south relationship of x and z:
From the constraints, we know that infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). This means x is vertically aligned with y. Additionally, we know supy(y) <= infy(z), which means y is entirely to the south of z.

Combining these, we can say:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely to the south of z.

So, the north-south relationship between x and z is clear: x is to the south of z. However, the east-west relationship is not fixed.

Given this, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW (Southwest): If x is to the west of z.
- S (South): If x and z overlap in their x-projections.
- SE (Southeast): If x is to the east of z.

Now, let's consider the constraints once more to see if any of these can be eliminated.

From x W y and y SE z, we know:
- x is to the west of y.
- y is to the east of z.

This means y is between x and z on the east-west axis. Given this, it seems unlikely that x could be to the east of z. In fact, x must be to the west of z (since x is to the west of y and y is to the east of z).

So, the only possible relation between x and z is SW (Southwest), as x is to the south and west of z.

Actually, let me check this once more.

Let's think about the constraints:
- x is to the west of y, and within y's vertical extent.
- y is to the southeast of z, which means y is to the east and south of z.

Hmm, depending on the exact positions, x could potentially be directly south of z. Let me check if the constraints allow this.

If y is to the southeast of z, and x is to the west of y, then x is to the west and south of y, which is to the east and south of z. This doesn't directly tell us the position of x relative to z.

Let's consider some specific placements:

1. If x and z are aligned on the east-west axis, then x could be to the SW of z.
2. If z is directly north of x, then x could be to the S of z.
3. If z is to the northeast of x, then x could be to the SW of z.

But can x be to the W of z? It would require x to be vertically aligned with z. Given that y is to the southeast of z, and x is to the west of y, x could potentially be to the west of z.

Actually, let's try a concrete example to see if we can decipher the possible relations.

Imagine z is at coordinates (5, 5).
Since y is SE of z, let's place y at, say, (7, 3).
Now, x is W of y, so x could be at, say, (3, 3).

In this example, the relation between x and z would be SW (x is to the southwest of z).

Now, let's try a different placement for x, still ensuring it's W of y:
Let's place x at (3, 4).

In this example, the relation between x and z would also be SW.

But what if x is directly south of z?
If z is at (5, 5) and y is at (7, 3), can x be at (5, 3)?

To be W of y, we need supx(x) <= infx(y), which would be satisfied if x is at (5, 3) and y is at (7, 3). We also need x's vertical extent to be within y's, which is satisfied here. So, it seems possible for x to be directly S of z.

Let's try one more placement to see if x can be to the W of z:
If z is at (5, 5) and y is at (7, 3), can x be at (3, 5)?

For x to be W of y, we need x's vertical extent to be within y's. But if x is at (3, 5) and y is at (7, 3), then x's north edge is above y's, which violates the W relation.

Actually, this is wrong. The second constraint for W says "infy(y) <= infy(x)". This means that the south edge of x should not be below the south edge of y. It doesn't prevent the north edge of x from being above the north edge of y.

Let me revisit this, and apologies for the confusion.

So, for a W relation between x and y, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the west of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's south edge is not above x's south edge)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's north edge is not above y's north edge)

The second constraint means that if y has its south edge at y=3, then x's south edge cannot be below y=3. The third constraint means that if y has its north edge at y=7, then x's north edge cannot be above y=7.

So, if z is at (5, 5) with dimensions 1x1, y is at (7, 3), and x is at (3, 5), let's check if x W y is satisfied:
- supx(x) = 4, infx(y) = 6, so supx(x) <= infx(y) is satisfied.
- infy(y) = 2, infy(x) = 4, so infy(y) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
- supy(x) = 6, supy(y) = 4, so supy(x) <= supy(y) is NOT satisfied. We were wrong, x can't be at (3, 5) if y is at (7, 3).

OK, I don't think I've been careful enough when visualizing these examples. Let's try again, but with explicit bounds instead of just center points.

Suppose:
- Region z has bounds [(4, 4), (6, 6)] (i.e., bottom-left at (4, 4), top-right at (6, 6)).
- Region y is SE of z, so it's entirely to the east and south of z. Let's say y has bounds [(7, 2), (9, 3)].
- Region x is W of y.

For x to be W of y, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(y), meaning x is entirely to the west of y. Given infx(y) = 7, supx(x) <= 7.
- infy(y) <= infy(x), meaning x's south edge is not below y's. Given infy(y) = 2, infy(x) >= 2.
- supy(x) <= supy(y), meaning x's north edge is not above y's. Given supy(y) = 3, supy(x) <= 3.

So, x has bounds [(?, ?), (supx, supy)] where supx <= 7 and 2 <= infy and supy <= 3.

Let's consider a few options for x to determine the relation between x and z:

Case 1: x with bounds [(3, 2), (5, 3)].
This x is W of y (constraints are satisfied). It's also SW of z, because it's to the west and south of z.

Case 2: x with bounds [(5, 2), (6, 3)].
This x is W of y (constraints are satisfied). It's also S of z, because it's directly south of z.

case 3: x with bounds [(6, 2), (7, 3)].
This x is W of y (constraints are satisfied). It's also S of z, because it's directly south of z.

So, SW and S are possible relations between x and z.

Can x be W of z?
For that, x needs to be to the west of z and within z's vertical extent.
Let's try x with bounds [(3, 4), (4, 5)].
This x is to the west of z. It also satisfies the constraints for being W of y. So, W is also a possible relation between x and z.

Can x be NW of z?
For that, x needs to be to the northwest of z.
Let's try x with bounds [(3, 6), (4, 7)].
This x is to the northwest of z. But it doesn't satisfy the constraint supy(x) <= supy(y) for being W of y. So, it seems NW is not a possible relation.

Can x be B (within the bounding box) of z?
For that, x needs to be within z's bounds.
But that would mean x is not to the west of y, which contradicts the given relation x W y. So, B is not a possible relation.

From our examples, it seems that the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW
- S
- W

Let me re-verify this:

Constraints:
- x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z)

For SW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
Given x W y and y SE z, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y). This doesn't directly imply supx(x) <= infx(z).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, the y-condition for SW is satisfied, but the x-condition is not guaranteed. It depends on the specific placements of x and z.

For S, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z).
Given x W y and y SE z, we have:
- The x-conditions (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) are not directly implied.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, the y-condition for S is satisfied, but the x-conditions are not guaranteed.

For W, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
Given x W y and y SE z, we have:
- The x-condition (supx(x) <= infx(z)) is not directly implied.
- For the y-conditions, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). Additionally, supy(y) <= infy(z). But this doesn't directly tell us about the relation between infy(z) and infy(x) or supy(x) and supy(z).

So, the conditions for W are not guaranteed either.

OK, let me just go back to my examples and double check.

- Region z has bounds [(4, 4), (6, 6)].
- Region y has bounds [(7, 2), (9, 3)].

I need to check whether each of S, W, and SW can work. Let's define each region:

Case SW: x with bounds [(3, 2), (4, 3)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 4 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 3. Yes.
Checking x SW z:
- supx(x) = 4 <= infx(z) = 4. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= infy(z) = 4. Yes.
So, SW is possible.

Case S: x with bounds [(5, 2), (6, 3)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 6 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 3. Yes.
Checking x S z:
- infx(z) = 4 <= infx(x) = 5 and supx(x) = 6 <= supx(z) = 6. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= infy(z) = 4. Yes.
So, S is possible.

Case W: x with bounds [(3, 4), (4, 6)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 4 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 4. Yes.
- supy(x) = 6 > supy(y) = 3. No! This violates the W relation between x and y.

Let me try a different example for W.

Case W (adjusted): x with bounds [(3, 2), (4, 3)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 4 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 3. Yes.
Checking x W z:
- supx(x) = 4 <= infx(z) = 4. Yes.
- infy(z) = 4 > infy(x) = 2. No. This means x extends below z, violating the W relation.
- supy(x) = 3 < supy(z) = 6. Yes. This means x doesn't extend above z.

Actually, let's try once more for W:

Case W (adjusted): x with bounds [(3, 4), (4, 6)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 4 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 4. Yes.
- supy(x) = 6 > supy(y) = 3. No! This violates the W relation between x and y.

Oh wait I made a mistake. For x W y, we need supy(x) <= supy(y), which means x's north edge shouldn't be above y's. But in these examples, if y's at (7, 2) to (9, 3) then any x that extends beyond y=3 would violate this.

OK, given the constraints, I believe W isn't a valid relation between x and z because x cannot extend north beyond y, and y is south of z.

So far, the possible relations are SW and S.

Let's check for SE:

Case SE: x with bounds [(6, 2), (7, 3)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 7 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 3. Yes.
Checking x SE z:
- supx(z) = 6 <= infx(x) = 6. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= infy(z) = 4. Yes.
So, SE is also possible.

Let's check NW:

Case NW: x with bounds [(3, 5), (4, 6)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 4 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 5. Yes.
- supy(x) = 6 > supy(y) = 3. No! This violates the W relation between x and y.
So, NW doesn't appear to be possible.

Let's check NE:

Case NE: x with bounds [(6, 5), (7, 6)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 7 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 5. Yes.
- supy(x) = 6 > supy(y) = 3. No! This violates the W relation between x and y.
So, NE doesn't appear to be possible.

Let's check N:

Case N: x with bounds [(5, 5), (6, 6)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 6 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 5. Yes.
- supy(x) = 6 > supy(y) = 3. No! This violates the W relation between x and y.
So, N doesn't appear to be possible.

Let's check E:

Case E: x with bounds [(6, 2), (7, 3)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 7 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 3. Yes.
Checking x E z:
- supx(z) = 6 <= infx(x) = 6. Yes.
- infy(z) = 4 > infy(x) = 2. No, because infy(z) has to be <= infy(x) for the E relation, but we have infy(z) > infy(x).

So, E does not see to be a possibility.

Actually, let me check the W again to be sure.

The idea is to determine if x can be placed to the west of z while satisfying the constraint of being to the west of y and within y's vertical extent.

Constraints:
- x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z)

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's break this down for our example:
- z: [(4, 4), (6, 6)]
- y: [(7, 2), (9, 3)]

The key constraint is supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z, contradicting the y-conditions for the W relation.

So, W doesn't seem to be a valid relation between x and z.

Let me check B:

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)

Like with the W relation, the constraints on the y-coordinates prevent x from being within the bounding box of z. So, B doesn't appear to be a possible relation.

To summarize, from my analysis, it appears that the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW
- S
- SE

Let's double-check these to be sure.

SW: x is to the southwest of z.
Given the constraints, x is to the south of z (because supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)). x can also be to the west of z if placed appropriately. So, SW is a valid relation.

S: x is directly south of z.
Again, x is to the south of z because of the constraints. If x and z overlap in their x-projections, then x is directly south of z. So, S is also a valid relation.

SE: x is to the southeast of z.
Given x W y and y SE z, x is to the west of y and y is to the east of z. It seems like x should be to the west of z, or perhaps aligned with z, but not to the east of z. Let me revisit my previous example:

case SE: x with bounds [(6, 2), (7, 3)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 7 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 3. Yes.
Checking x SE z:
- supx(z) = 6 <= infx(x) = 6. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= infy(z) = 4. Yes.

This looks correct. If z is at [(4, 4), (6, 6)] and y is at [(7, 2), (9, 3)], then x can be at [(6, 2), (7, 3)], which is to the southeast of z. So, SE is a valid relation.

To be thorough, let me check E:

Case E: x with bounds [(6, 2), (7, 3)].
Checking x W y:
- supx(x) = 7 <= infx(y) = 7. Yes.
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2. Yes.
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 3. Yes.
Checking x E z:
- supx(z) = 6 <= infx(x) = 6. Yes.
- infy(z) = 4 > infy(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 3 < supy(z) = 6. No, these violate the y-conditions for the E relation.

So, E is still not a valid relation.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW
- S
- SE

Actually, let's take another approach to check. Let's try to visualize the regions that satisfy the constraints.

Here's the scenario:
- z is a region.
- y is to the southeast of z.
- x is to the west of y and within y's vertical extent.

Given these constraints:
- y is completely outside z's region, to the southeast.
- x is completely outside y's region, to the west.
- x's vertical extent is contained within y's vertical extent.

Since y is to the southeast of z, it means y is both to the east and south of z. Now, x is to the west of y, which means x could be:
1. To the west of both y and z.
2. To the west of y but potentially overlapping with z's east-west projection.

Additionally, since x's vertical extent is within y's, and y is to the south of z, x must also be to the south of z.

Let me add to my prior set of potential examples and check:

Consider x with bounds [(2, 2), (3, 3)], y with bounds [(7, 2), (9, 3)], and z with bounds [(4, 4), (6, 6)].
- x is to the west of y, so x W y is satisfied.
- y is to the southeast of z, so y SE z is satisfied.
- The relation between x and z is SW.

Ok, so SW is a possible relation.

Consider x with bounds [(5, 2), (6, 3)], y with bounds [(7, 2), (9, 3)], and z with bounds [(4, 4), (6, 6)].
- x is to the west of y, so x W y is satisfied.
- y is to the southeast of z, so y SE z is satisfied.
- The relation between x and z is S.

So, S is also a possible relation.

Consider x with bounds [(6, 2), (7, 3)], y with bounds [(8, 2), (9, 3)], and z with bounds [(4, 4), (6, 6)].
- x is to the west of y, so x W y is satisfied.
- y is to the southeast of z, so y SE z is satisfied.
- The relation between x and z is SE.

So, SE is also a possible relation.

(Bascially I was right in my conclusion above.)

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW
- S
- SE

Hmm, actually I realize now that there are other potential relations I can check.

let me look at W again:

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given the constraints
- x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z)

We have supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
thus, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x's north edge is below z's south edge. This contradicts the requirement for x W z, which would require x to overlap with z vertically.

So, W is not a possibility.

Ok, let's check B:

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

But we've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z, which contradicts the y-conditions for B.

So, B is not a possibility.

Finally, let's check NW:

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Again, we've determined that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the y-condition for NW.

So, NW is not a possibility.

I'm satisfied with the conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW
- S
- SE

This covers all possible relations.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Let me determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

First, I'll analyze what these constraints tell us:
- x W y means x is to the west of y and vertically aligned with y's extent
- y SE z means y is to the southeast of z (both east and south of z)

From these constraints:
- Since x is to the west of y, and y is to the east of z, x could be southwest, south, or southeast of z depending on the exact horizontal placement of x relative to z.
- Since y is to the south of z, and x's vertical extent is contained within y's vertical extent, x must be south of z.

Let me check each possible relation:

SW (Southwest): 
- Possible if x is positioned west of both y and z while being south of z.

S (South):
- Possible if x is directly below z (overlapping with z's projection on the x-axis).

SE (Southeast):
- Possible if x is east of z but west of y, while being south of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and SE.
