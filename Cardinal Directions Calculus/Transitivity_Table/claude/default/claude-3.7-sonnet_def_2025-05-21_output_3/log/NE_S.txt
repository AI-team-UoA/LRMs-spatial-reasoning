PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step.

I need to determine possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is S of region z

First, let me understand what these existing relations mean according to the definitions:

1. x NE y means: 
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y S z means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the east-west bounds of z)

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze what we know:

From x NE y:
- x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- x is to the north of y: supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y S z:
- y is to the south of z: supy(y) <= infy(z)
- y's east-west position is bounded by z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, I need to combine these to determine the relationship between x and z:

For the east-west relationship:
- We know supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
- We know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within east-west bounds of z)

This means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

So x is definitely to the east of z (since infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)), which means the direction could be NE, E, or SE.

For the north-south relationship:
- We know supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)
- We know supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is south of z)

From these, we can't directly determine the north-south relationship between x and z. Let's consider the possibilities:

1. If infy(x) > infy(z), then x is fully north of z, making the relation NE.
2. If infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(x) >= supy(z), then x overlaps with z in the north-south dimension, making the relation E.
3. If supy(x) < supy(z), then x is fully south of z, making the relation SE.
4. If infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x could be partially or fully within the north-south bounds of z, allowing for E.
5. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is north of z, making the relation NE.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider the north-south relationship:

From x NE y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of y.
From y S z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z), which means y is to the south of z.

So, we have:
supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is south of z)

From these inequalities, we can't directly determine whether x is north, south, or at the same level as z. So, x could be:
- North of z (NE relation)
- At the same north-south level as z (E relation)
- South of z (SE relation)

Let's reason more carefully:

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For the east-west relationship:
From x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which indicates that x is to the east of z, or in other words, the relation could be NE, E, or SE.

For the north-south relationship:
From x NE y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we know:
supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z))

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), so we need to consider different cases:

1. If infy(x) > infy(z), then x is to the north of z, making the relation NE.
2. If infy(x) < infy(z), then x is to the south of z, making the relation SE.
3. If infy(x) = infy(z), then x and z start at the same y-coordinate, but we also need to consider their upper bounds:
   a. If supy(x) < supy(z), then x is partially enclosed by z in the north-south dimension, making the relation E.
   b. If supy(x) > supy(z), then z is partially enclosed by x in the north-south dimension, still making the relation E.
   c. If supy(x) = supy(z), then x and z have the same north-south extent, making the relation E.

So, considering all these cases, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE.

Hmm, but I think there's still something off with my reasoning. Let me reconsider. 

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let me analyze each direction (north, east, south, west) separately:

East: 
- From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- From y S z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within the bounds of z)
- Combining, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which indicates that x is to the east of z or overlaps with it horizontally.

North:
- From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- From y S z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- This doesn't directly tell us the north-south relationship between x and z.

South:
- From the above, we can't determine if x is to the south of z or not.

West:
- From the east analysis, we know x is to the east of z or overlaps with it horizontally, so x is not to the west of z.

Given these constraints, let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

NE: Possible if x is to both the north and east of z.
E: Possible if x is to the east of z and overlaps with z in the north-south dimension.
SE: Possible if x is to both the south and east of z.
N: Possible if x overlaps with z in the east-west dimension and is to the north of z.
B: Possible if x is inside the bounding box of z.
S: Possible if x overlaps with z in the east-west dimension and is to the south of z.
NW, W, SW: Not possible because x is to the east of z or overlaps with it horizontally.

Actually, I think I'm over-complicating this. Let me reason in a simpler way:

Given:
- x NE y: x is to the northeast of y
- y S z: y is to the south of z

This means x is to the northeast of y, and y is to the south of z.

Imagine z as the reference, then y is to the south of z. From y's perspective, x is to the northeast. So, from z's perspective, x could be to the east, northeast, or southeast, depending on the exact positions.

But wait, I need to be precise about this based on the definitions provided.

Let's use a concrete example to help understand. Imagine z is at the origin (0, 0). Since y is S of z, y could be at (0, -1). Now, since x is NE of y, x could be at (1, 0).

In this case, x is at (1, 0), and z is at (0, 0), making x E of z. But if x were at (1, 1), it would be NE of z. Or if x were at (1, -1), it would be SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, or SE, dependening on the exact positions of the regions.

Actually, let's be even more precise. Given the definitions:

- x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y S z means: supy(y) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's see what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z by using these constraints.

For the east-west relationship:
From x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)

This means x is to the east of the right edge of z, or at the very least, x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge. 

But we also have supx(y) <= supx(z), which means the right edge of y is to the left of the right edge of z. Combining with supx(y) <= infx(x), we get: supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)).

If infx(x) <= supx(z), then x and z overlap in the east-west dimension.
Otherwise, x is purely to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship:
From x NE y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these:
supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z))

This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(x) and infy(z).

If infy(x) <= infy(z), then x's bottom edge is below z's bottom edge, which means x could overlap with z in the north-south dimension or be entirely below z.
If infy(x) > infy(z), then x's bottom edge is above z's bottom edge, which means x could be entirely above z or still overlap with z in the north-south dimension.

Given these possible relationships, let's enumerate the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z:

NE: Possible if x is entirely to the east and north of z.
E: Possible if x is entirely to the east of z and overlaps with z in the north-south dimension.
SE: Possible if x is entirely to the east and south of z.
N: Not directly determinable from the given constraints.
B: Not directly determinable from the given constraints.
S: Not directly determinable from the given constraints.
NW, W, SW: Not possible because x is to the east of z or overlaps with it horizontally.

Let me refine my reasoning a bit more, considering the constraints more carefully:

From x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For the east-west relationship:
infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)
supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)

This gives us:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

This doesn't directly tell us if infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(x) > supx(z). If infx(x) <= supx(z), then there's a horizontal overlap between x and z. Otherwise, x is strictly to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship:
supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Let me reconsider the problem from a different angle. 

In the constraints provided:
x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
y S z means: supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within the bounds of z)

The only concrete information we have about the north-south relationship is:
- x is to the north of y
- y is to the south of z

This doesn't directly tell us the north-south relationship between x and z. It could be that:
1. x is to the north of z
2. x overlaps with z in the north-south dimension
3. x is to the south of z

Similarly, for the east-west relationship:
- x is to the east of y
- y is horizontally within the bounds of z

This gives us some limitations on the relationship between x and z, but it doesn't constrain it to a single direction.

Given these ambiguities, let's consider a few examples to see the possible relationships:

Example 1:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 1x1
- y is at (0, -2) with dimensions 1x1 (so y is S of z)
- x is at (2, -1) with dimensions 1x1 (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is E of z.

Example 2:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 1x1
- y is at (0, -2) with dimensions 1x1 (so y is S of z)
- x is at (2, 1) with dimensions 1x1 (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is NE of z.

Example 3:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 1x1
- y is at (0, -2) with dimensions 1x1 (so y is S of z)
- x is at (2, -3) with dimensions 1x1 (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is SE of z.

Based on these examples, it seems that x can be in NE, E, or SE direction relative to z. It cannot be in NW, W, or SW directions because x must be to the east of y, and y is horizontally within the bounds of z, so x must be to the east of z or overlap with it horizontally.

Let me check this reasoning against a few more examples:

Example 4:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 3x3
- y is at (1, -4) with dimensions 1x1 (so y is S of z)
- x is at (3, -3) with dimensions 1x1 (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x would be at the SE corner of z, but not fully SE (it's touching z). This would still make x SE of z according to the definitions.

Example 5:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 3x3
- y is at (1, -4) with dimensions 1x1 (so y is S of z)
- x is at (3, -1) with dimensions 1x1 (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x would be at the E edge of z. This would make x E of z according to the definitions.

Example 6:
- z is at (0, 0) with dimensions 3x3
- y is at (1, -4) with dimensions 1x1 (so y is S of z)
- x is at (3, 2) with dimensions 1x1 (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x would be at the NE corner of z, but not fully NE (it's touching z). This would still make x NE of z according to the definitions.

From these examples, it seems that the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are NE, E, and SE (but not including B). Let's double-check this by going back to the definitions:

According to the given definition of cardinal directions, even if two regions touch, they are still considered to be in separate cardinal directions. For example, if x is just to the east of z (touching z without any vertical overlap), then x would be considered E of z.

Furthermore, from what I understand of the given constraints, x can only be in the NE, E, or SE direction relative to z. It can't be in the NW, W, SW directions (due to the east-west constraints), and it can't be in the N, B, or S directions because x is to the east of y, and y is horizontally within the bounds of z, which means x must be to the east of z or overlap with it horizontally.

Wait, but I need to be more specific. The definition is actually more like:

E means "fully to the east and overlapping in the north-south dimension."
NE means "fully to the northeast."
SE means "fully to the southeast."

Let's go back to our constraints:
- x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- y S z means: supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within the bounds of z)

For x to be E of z, we would need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x overlaps with z in the north-south dimension)

For x to be NE of z, we would need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

Now, let's check if our constraints allow for these:

East-West constraint:
From y S z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x)
Combining, we get: supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z))

If infx(x) <= supx(z), then there's a horizontal overlap between x and z. Otherwise, x is strictly to the east of z.

North-South constraint:
From y S z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z)
From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x)
Combining, we get: supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z))

However, this does not directly tell us the north-south relationship between x and z.

Let's approach this systematically:

Suppose that the regions are simple rectangles to make the visualization clearer (though the arguments would generalize to arbitrary regions in REG).

Given:
- x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y S z means: supy(y) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

I want to check if the relation between x and z can be one of the nine possible cardinal directions: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE.

First, let's check the east-west relationship:
From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x)
From y S z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
Combining, we get: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

So, the rightmost edge of z (supx(z)) could be to the left of the leftmost edge of x (infx(x)), in which case x is fully to the east of z.
Or, the rightmost edge of z (supx(z)) could be to the right of the leftmost edge of x (infx(x)), in which case there's a horizontal overlap between x and z.

Now, let's check the north-south relationship:
From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x)
From y S z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z)
Combining, we get: supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z))

This doesn't directly tell us the north-south relationship between x and z. x could be fully to the north of z, fully to the south of z, or there could be a vertical overlap.

Given these possibilities, let's go through each of the nine cardinal directions and check if it's possible for x to be in that direction relative to z:

NW: For x to be NW of z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). From our east-west analysis, we know infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x), contradicting supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be NW of z.

N: For x to be N of z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). From our east-west analysis, we know infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), so x can't be fully within the horizontal bounds of z. Hence, x cannot be N of z.

NE: For x to be NE of z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is not directly given by our constraints, and the second condition is also not directly given. But we do know that y is to the south of z, and x is to the northeast of y, which is consistent with x being to the northeast of z. So, NE is a possibility.

Actually, let me construct a specific example to confirm:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (3, 3)
- y spans from (1, -1) to (2, -0.5) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (4, 3.5) to (5, 4.5) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is clearly NE of z. So, NE is a possible relation.

W: For x to be W of z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Similar to the NW case, the first condition contradicts our east-west analysis. So, x cannot be W of z.

B: For x to be B of z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). From our east-west analysis, we know infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), so x can't be fully within the horizontal bounds of z. Hence, x cannot be B of z.

E: For x to be E of z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know that y is S of z and x is NE of y. Constructing a specific example:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (3, 3)
- y spans from (1, -1) to (2, -0.5) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (4, 0.5) to (5, 2.5) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is E of z.

SW: For x to be SW of z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Similar to the NW and W cases, the first condition contradicts our east-west analysis. So, x cannot be SW of z.

S: For x to be S of z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). From our east-west analysis, we know infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), so x can't be fully within the horizontal bounds of z. Hence, x cannot be S of z.

SE: For x to be SE of z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition is consistent with our constraints. For the second condition, we know y is S of z, so supy(y) <= infy(z). But we also know x is NE of y, so supy(y) <= infy(x). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). But it's possible for x to be below z.

Constructing a specific example to confirm:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (3, 3)
- y spans from (1, -1) to (2, -0.5) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (4, -2) to (5, -1.5) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is clearly SE of z. So, SE is a possible relation.

Based on the above analysis and the examples I've constructed, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE.

Actually, wait, I want to check once more whether the relation "B" is possible. For x to be B of z, we would need:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically within z)

However, from our constraints, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z).

Combining, we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the first part of condition 1. But we don't know if supx(x) <= supx(z). If supx(x) > supx(z), then x extends beyond the right edge of z, which means x can't be B of z.

Similarly, for the north-south relationship, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z).

So, based on our constraints, it's ambiguous whether x can be fully inside the bounding box of z (i.e., have the B relation).

However, given the constraints we have, I can't find a specific example where x would be B of z. Let's try once more, by going back to the constrains:

From x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within the bounds of z)

Now, for x to be B of z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically within z)

From our constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

So, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the first part of the horizontal condition for B. But for x to be B of z, we would also need supx(x) <= supx(z). However, from our constraints, we don't know the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

Similarly, for the vertical condition, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). For x to be B of z, we would need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

I can't conclusively determine if x can be B of z. Let me try to construct a specific example:

Let's say:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 5)
- y spans from (1, -1) to (2, -0.5) (so y is S of z as supy(y) = -0.5 < infy(z) = 0 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 5)
- x spans from (3, 1) to (4, 2) (so x is NE of y as supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3 and supy(y) = -0.5 <= infy(x) = 1)

In this example, x is within the bounding box of z, so x is B of z. This is because:
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 3 and supx(x) = 4 <= supx(z) = 5
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 1 and supy(x) = 2 <= supy(z) = 5

So, B is also a possible relation.

To double-check, let's confirm that the "B" relation satisfies our constraints:

From x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within the bounds of z)

From x B z, we would have:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically within z)

Let's verify:
1. From y S z and x NE y, we get: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which is consistent with infx(z) <= infx(x) from x B z.
2. From y S z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z), but it's unclear if supx(x) <= supx(z). So, this part of x B z is not directly determined by our constraints.
3. Similarly, for the vertical aspects of x B z, our constraints don't directly determine the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z).

Based on the example I constructed and the verification of constraints, it seems that B is indeed a possible relation between x and z.

Actually I really think i should double-check whether B, NE, E, and SE are all the only possible directions. Let me be extra thorough and check each possibility:

NW: For x to be NW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

From our constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (from y S z and x NE y)

This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not a possible relation.

N: For x to be N of z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

From our constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (from y S z and x NE y)

This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the first part of the horizontal condition for N. But for x to be N of z, we would also need supx(x) <= supx(z). Since x is to the east of y (from x NE y), and y is horizontally within z (from y S z), it's unclear if x would be horizontally within z.

Let me see if I can come up with a specific example for N:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 5)
- y spans from (2, -1) to (3, -0.5) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (4, 6) to (5, 7) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is N of z. But wait, my example is not right as infx(x) = 4 and supx(x) = 5, but infx(z) = 0 and supx(z) = 5, so infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

Actually this example doesn't work because for x to be N of z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

But from our constraints, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (from y S z and x NE y)

This means infx(z) <= infx(x), but for x to be N of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

Given that supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z), we can't determine a direct constraint on supx(x) and supx(z).

Let me try one more specific example to check if N is possible:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 5)
- y spans from (2, -1) to (3, -0.5) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (4, 6) to (4.5, 7) (so x is NE of y)

Now, infx(x) = 4 and supx(x) = 4.5, so supx(x) = 4.5 <= supx(z) = 5.
Also, supy(z) = 5 <= infy(x) = 6.

In this case, x is N of z. Actually, no... for x to be N of z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), but our constraints give us infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x). However, this doesn't guarantee supx(x) <= supx(z), and it actually suggests the opposite (implying that x is at least partially to the east of z).

But I realize that my reasoning is not correct. Let's be more precise. From the fact x is NE of y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From the fact y is S of z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within the bounds of z)

For N, E can overlap horizontally, as long as x is strictly north of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within the bounds of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

Just from our constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (from y S z and x NE y)

So, infx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the first part of the horizontal condition for N. But for x to be N of z, we would also need supx(x) <= supx(z). From our constraints, we can't directly infer this, but there's no contradicting information, so let's try a specific example:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 5)
- y spans from (2, -1) to (3, -0.5) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (4, 6) to (4.5, 7) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, supx(x) = 4.5 <= supx(z) = 5, so the horizontal condition for N is satisfied. Also, supy(z) = 5 <= infy(x) = 6, so the vertical condition for N is also satisfied. Therefore, N is a possible relation.

Actually wait, I still think i'm getting confused here... Here is the definition of N:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

In the context of our problem, for x to be N of z, we would need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within the bounds of z)

From the fact x is NE of y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From the fact y is S of z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within the bounds of z)

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (from y S z and x NE y)

This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the first part of the horizontal condition for N. But for x to be N of z, we would also need supx(x) <= supx(z). From our constraints, we can't directly infer this, but there's no contradicting information either, so it's possible for supx(x) <= supx(z).

For the vertical condition, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)

This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x), so we can't determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) from our constraints directly. But again, there's no contradicting information, so it's possible for supy(z) <= infy(x).

To confirm that N is a possible relation, let's see if we can construct a specific example:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 5)
- y spans from (2, -1) to (3, -0.5) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (4, 6) to (4.5, 7) (so x is NE of y, since supx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4 and supy(y) = -0.5 <= infy(x) = 6)

In this example, supx(x) = 4.5 <= supx(z) = 5, which satisfies the horizontal condition for N. Also, supy(z) = 5 <= infy(x) = 6, which satisfies the vertical condition for N. So, in this specific example, x is N of z, which confirms that N is a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, E, SE, and B. Let me double-check from these which ones are possible using specific examples.

N: Let's recheck this with a simple example:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
- y spans from (4, -5) to (6, -1) (so y is S of z, as supy(y) = -1 <= infy(z) = 0 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 4 and supx(y) = 6 <= supx(z) = 10)
- x spans from (8, 11) to (9, 13) (so x is NE of y, as supx(y) = 6 <= infx(x) = 8 and supy(y) = -1 <= infy(x) = 11)

In this example, x is N of z as infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 8 and supx(x) = 9 <= supx(z) = 10 (x is horizontally within the bounds of z), and supy(z) = 10 <= infy(x) = 11 (x is to the north of z).

Actually no, let me correct this. x is not N of z in the example. Actually, I'm getting confused here. Let me double check again. For x to be N of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x). In the example, we have infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 8 and supx(x) = 9 <= supx(z) = 10, and supy(z) = 10 <= infy(x) = 11. So, x is indeed N of z.

So N is definitely a possible relation.

Let's recheck NE, E, SE, and B, only by considering the constraints and constructing specific examples.

NE: Let's use a simple example:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 5)
- y spans from (2, -1) to (3, -0.5) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (6, 6) to (7, 7) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is NE of z, because supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of z) and supy(z) = 5 <= infy(x) = 6 (x is to the north of z).

E: Let's use a simple example:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 5)
- y spans from (2, -1) to (3, -0.5) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (6, 2) to (7, 3) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is E of z, because supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of z) and infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 3 <= supy(z) = 5 (x is vertically within the bounds of z).

SE: Let's use a simple example:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 5)
- y spans from (2, -2) to (3, -1) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (6, -3) to (7, -2.5) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is SE of z, because supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of z) and supy(x) = -2.5 <= infy(z) = 0 (x is to the south of z).

B: Let's use a simple example:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
- y spans from (2, -1) to (3, -0.5) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (4, 2) to (5, 3) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, x is B of z, because infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 4 and supx(x) = 5 <= supx(z) = 10 (x is horizontally within the bounds of z) and infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 3 <= supy(z) = 10 (x is vertically within the bounds of z).

So, we can confirm that N, NE, E, SE, and B are all possible relations between x and z.

Let's be even more thorough, and double-check if S, SW, W, or NW are also possible relations:

S: For x to be S of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within the bounds of z)

From our constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (from y S z and x NE y)

This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the first part of the horizontal condition for S. But for x to be S of z, we would also need supx(x) <= supx(z). From our constraints, we can't directly infer this, but there's no contradicting information either, so it's possible for supx(x) <= supx(z).

For the vertical condition, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)

This doesn't directly tell us if supy(x) <= infy(z). So, let's try a specific example:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
- y spans from (2, -5) to (3, -1) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (5, -7) to (7, -6) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, supx(x) = 7 <= supx(z) = 10, but we also have supy(x) = -6 <= infy(z) = 0, which means x is to the south of z. So, in this specific example, x is S of z, which confirms that S is a possible relation.

Let's check if SW, W, or NW are also possible relations:

SW: For x to be SW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

From our constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (from y S z and x NE y)

This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which is definitely not equal to supx(x) <= infx(z). So, SW is not a possible relation.

W: For x to be W of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically within the bounds of z)

Again, from our constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x), which is not equal to supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not a possible relation.

NW: For x to be NW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

Once more, from our constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x), which is not equal to supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not a possible relation.

So in summary, the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.

Actually, thinking about this one more time with concrete examples, I'm not sure if S is truly possible. Let's reconsider:

For x to be S of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within the bounds of z)

From our constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (from y S z and x NE y)

This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with the first part of the horizontal condition for S. But for x to be S of z, we would also need supx(x) <= supx(z). From our constraints, we can't directly infer this, but there's no contradicting information either, so let's try a specific example:

Let's say:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
- y spans from (2, -2) to (3, -1) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (4, -4) to (9, -3) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 4 and supx(x) = 9 <= supx(z) = 10, which satisfies the horizontal condition for S. Also, supy(x) = -3 <= infy(z) = 0, which satisfies the vertical condition for S. So, in this specific example, x is S of z, which confirms that S is a possible relation.

Ok, I'm pretty confident in the results now! Let's summarize:
* From the fact x is NE of y, we have:
  - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
  - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
* From the fact y is S of z, we have:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within the bounds of z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (from y S z and x NE y)
- supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z)) (from x NE y and y S z)

For a relation to be possible between x and z, these must be satisfied.
N, NE, E, SE, S, and B are all possible. This has been verified by constructing specific examples for each.

Actually, let me double check S again. A relation S requires supx(x) <= supx(z), and we know from our constraints that infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). We also know supx(y) <= supx(z), but we can't directly infer if supx(x) <= supx(z). 

Let me double-check with another specific example:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
- y spans from (5, -2) to (6, -1) (so y is S of z: supy(y) = -1 <= infy(z) = 0 and infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 5 and supx(y) = 6 <= supx(z) = 10)
- x spans from (8, -4) to (11, -3) (so x is NE of y: supx(y) = 6 <= infx(x) = 8 and supy(y) = -1 <= infy(x) = -4)

Wait, this example does not work because y is NEt NE of x since infy(x) = -4, but supy(y) = -1, so supy(y) > infy(x) (while NE requires supy(y) <= infy(x)).

Let me try another one:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
- y spans from (5, -2) to (6, -1) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (8, -0.5) to (11, 0.5) (so x is NE of y, since supx(y) = 6 <= infx(x) = 8 and supy(y) = -1 <= infy(x) = -0.5)

In this example, supx(x) = 11 which is not <= supx(z) = 10. Let me try one more time:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
- y spans from (5, -2) to (6, -1) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (8, -0.5) to (9, 0.5) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, supx(x) = 9 <= supx(z) = 10, which satisfies the horizontal condition for S. Also, supy(x) = 0.5 which is not <= infy(z) = 0, so x is not to the south of z. 

This doesn't work for S. Let's try once more:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
- y spans from (5, -2) to (6, -1) (so y is S of z)
- x spans from (8, -3) to (9, -2) (so x is NE of y)

In this example, supx(x) = 9 <= supx(z) = 10, which satisfies the horizontal condition for S. Also, supy(x) = -2 <= infy(z) = 0, which satisfies the vertical condition for S. So, in this specific example, x is S of z, which confirms that S is a possible relation.

OK, so I'm going to make my final judgment. The possible directions between x and z are N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I need to analyze the possible relations between x and z when x is NE of y and y is S of z.

Let me reason through this step by step:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally within z's bounds)

Combining these constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)

The possible relations between x and z are:

1. NE: x can be northeast of z
2. E: x can be east of z
3. SE: x can be southeast of z
4. N: x can be north of z
5. S: x can be south of z
6. B: x can be inside z's bounding box

The relations NW, W, and SW are impossible because the constraints guarantee that x must be at least partially to the east of z.
