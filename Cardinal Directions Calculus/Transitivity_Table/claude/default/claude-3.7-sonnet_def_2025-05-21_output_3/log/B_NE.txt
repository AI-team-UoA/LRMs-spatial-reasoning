PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

We need to find the possible relations between regions x and z, given that region x is B (bounding box) of region y, and region y is NE (North East) of region z.

Let's first understand what each of these relations means:

1. **x B y**: This means that x is inside the bounding box of y, i.e.,
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

2. **y NE z**: This means that y is in the North East direction of z, i.e.,
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, let's try to understand the possible relations between x and z. 

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, we need to understand how these constraints relate x and z.

From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get: supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
This means that the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x. This is a property of the following cardinal direction relations: NE, E, SE.

From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get: supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
This means that the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x. This is a property of the following cardinal direction relations: NE, N, NW.

Combining these two, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are: NE.

But I feel I need to check this more carefully, since I'm not sure I got all the possible relations. Let me try again.

Given that x B y and y NE z, we need to find the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's derive the constraints between x and z:

From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get: supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
This indicates that z is to the left of x, which is a characteristic of the NW, N, or NE relations from x to z.

Hmm, I made a mistake. Let me clarify. If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), it means z is to the left of x. This is a characteristic of either W, NW, SW, or possibly N, NE, S, SE, or B if they share the same x-axis coordinates.

From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get: supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
This indicates that z is below x, which is a characteristic of the SW, S, or SE relations from x to z.

Hmm, I'm getting confused with the directions. Let me think about this differently.

Considering the constraints and trying to understand the possible positions of x and z, this seems complex. I think I need to reconsider the problem using a different approach.

Actually, I think I'm not taking the definitions of the cardinal relations correctly. Let me refer to the given definitions again.

The constraints I'm working with are:
1. x B y: x is inside the bounding box of y.
2. y NE z: y is in the North East direction of z.

I'll redo my analysis based on the exact definitions:

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  (The leftmost point of x is to the right of or at the same position as the leftmost point of y.)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  (The rightmost point of x is to the left of or at the same position as the rightmost point of y.)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (The bottommost point of x is above or at the same height as the bottommost point of y.)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)  (The topmost point of x is below or at the same height as the topmost point of y.)

For y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  (The rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of y.)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  (The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of y.)

Now, let's try to deduce the relation between x and z:

From y NE z, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y), and from x B y, we know infx(y) ≤ infx(x). Transitively, we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x, which implies that z is strictly to the left of x.

Similarly, from y NE z, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y), and from x B y, we know infy(y) ≤ infy(x). Transitively, we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x, which implies that z is strictly below x.

So, z is strictly to the left of x and strictly below x. This is the definition of the SE (South East) relation from the perspective of z. From the perspective of x, it would be NW (North West). This is assuming the problem asks for an x-to-z relation, making NW a possibility.

Hmm, I realize I'm still not being clear enough. Let me define the problem differently:

We have:
- x is B of y. Hm, so let's call this: "x B y"
- y is NE of z. Let's call this "y NE z"

We want to know what the relation of "x to z" could be. Let's call this relation "x ? z".

Every region x will be written as a set of points {(x_i, y_i)} in the Cartesian plane. The cardinal directions are defined based on the relative positions of these points.

We need to check every relation combination. Let me enumerate the conditions:

For "x NW z" to hold:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is completely below x)

For "x N z" to hold:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-axis projection is within z's x-axis projection)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is completely below x)

For "x NE z" to hold:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is completely to the left of x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is completely below x)

For "x W z" to hold:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-axis projection is within z's y-axis projection)

For "x B z" to hold:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-axis projection is within z's x-axis projection)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-axis projection is within z's y-axis projection)

For "x E z" to hold:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is completely to the left of x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-axis projection is within z's y-axis projection)

For "x SW z" to hold:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is completely below z)

For "x S z" to hold:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-axis projection is within z's x-axis projection)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is completely below z)

For "x SE z" to hold:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is completely to the left of x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is completely below z)

Now, let's determine which of these relations are compatible with our given constraints:

From "x B y", we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From "y NE z", we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means z is completely to the left of x.
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means z is completely below x.

Since z is completely to the left of x and completely below x, the relation "x ? z" corresponds to "x NE z".

But, in this problem, I think I've been misled by the use of "x NE z" to denote the relation of x to z. Actually, I should keep the definition of the cardinal direction relation as a relation of a to b. So if x NE z, then x is located North-East of z.

So the relation I'm trying to find is the relation of region x to region z. Since z is completely to the left of x and completely below x, by the definition of the SE (South East) relation, it's z SE x, which is the same as saying x is in the North West (NW) direction of z, i.e., x NW z.

Oh, I think I'm still making a similar mistake. Let me try once more, using another approach. 

I want to confirm I'm using the cardinal relation directions properly. By definition:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

This means region a is south of region b if the highest point of a is below or at the same level as the lowest point of b. Additionally, the x-coordinates of a are contained within or at the boundary of the x-coordinates of b.

Similarly for the other directions. Having confirmed the definitions, I will now determine the possible relation of region x to region z.

Given that x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

And y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's derive constraints on x and z:

From y NE z:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

From x B y:
infx(y) ≤ infx(x)

Combining:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)

This means: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which tells us that region z is completely to the left of region x.

From y NE z:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From x B y:
infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Combining:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This means: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which tells us that region z is completely below region x.

Now, by the definitions:

If region z is completely to the left of region x and completely below region x, then x is in the North-East direction of z, denoted as x NE z.

But, I want to double-check this. Let me refer to the definition of NE:

a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

This verifies that x NE z, given our derived constraints: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

OK there's a single relation from x to z which is NE. 

Actually let me try once more. Given:
- x B y, which means x is inside the bounding box of y.
- y NE z, which means y is to the north-east of z.

I'll try to find out the possible relation between x and z.

For x B y:
1. infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
2. supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
3. infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
4. supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For y NE z:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
2. supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From (1) of y NE z and (1) of x B y:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
Therefore, supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

Similarly, from (2) of y NE z and (3) of x B y:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
Therefore, supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

We conclude:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
2. supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

By the definition of NE (North East) relation, a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

Plugging in our results, x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), which is exactly what we have.

Therefore, x is in the NE (North East) direction of z, denoted as x NE z. This is the possible relation between region x and region z.

Hmm, I'm still not fully convinced because NE seems quite clear, but I feel I might have missed something. Let me check if there are any additional relations between x and z that are compatible with our given constraints.

Could x also be in the N (North) direction of z?
For x N z, we need: (a) supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and (b) infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
I've already established (a). For (b), we don't have any constraints that guarantee infx(z) ≤ infx(x) or supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Thus, x N z is not necessarily true, but it also isn't ruled out. So, N is a possibility.

Actually wait, let's use what we've derived above:

We have: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

This contradicts the condition for x N z, which includes infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is satisfied. BUT, the same constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x) suggests that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

Hence, x N z is ruled out.

I'm going to go through all the other possible directions systematically, and see which ones are compatible with our derived constraints:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (region z is completely to the left of region x)
2. supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (region z is completely below region x)

For x NW z, we need (a) supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and (b) supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We've established (b). But for (a), we've derived supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which, combined with the transitivity of ≤, gives supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). This doesn't guarantee or rule out supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Thus, x NW z is possible.

Hmm, actually, wait. The condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z) means x is completely to the left of z. But we've derived supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means z is completely to the left of x. These are contradictory. Hence, x NW z is ruled out.

For x W z, we need (a) supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and (b) infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). For the same reason as with NW, condition (a) is contradicted by our derived constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Hence, x W z is ruled out.

For x SW z, we need (a) supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and (b) supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Again, condition (a) is contradicted. Additionally, we've derived supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts (b). Hence, x SW z is ruled out.

For x S z, we need (a) supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and (b) infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Our derived constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts (a). Hence, x S z is ruled out.

For x B z, we need (a) infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and (b) infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Our derived constraints supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) mean z is completely to the left of and below x, which contradicts the conditions for x B z. Hence, x B z is ruled out.

For x SE z, we need (a) supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and (b) supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We've established (a), but our derived constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts (b). Hence, x SE z is ruled out.

For x E z, we need (a) supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and (b) infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've established (a). For (b), while we've derived supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which satisfies infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (by transitivity), we don't have constraints that guarantee or rule out supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Thus, x E z is possible.

Hmm, I'm not being thorough enough. For x E z, we need both (a) and (b). While (a) is satisfied, the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is not necessarily true. In fact, our derived constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) suggests that the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x, which contradicts the possibility of the topmost point of x being below the topmost point of z. Hence, x E z is ruled out.

Thus, after a comprehensive check, it seems that x NE z is the only possible relation.

But I realize my analysis could be flawed. Let me directly check. To get the relation, I want to check what we've derived for region x and region z:

1. supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (region z is completely to the left of region x)
2. supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (region z is completely below region x)

Looking back at the definition of each directional relation, there's a match for when one region is North East of another. Let me review:

- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a). Substituting a with x and b with z, we get supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). These are the same as the constraints we derived from our given information, indeed making a NE b, or in the context of our problem, x NE z.

Therefore, North East (NE) is a valid relation between region x and region z.

But I missed something. The problem statement doesn't indicate that the regions are disjoint, so I should also consider cases where they overlap in certain ways. Let me check the other potential relations once more, considering the possibility of overlap.

Actually, if we're being thorough, I have to check for every relation that might be satisfied by our derived constraints:

1. supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (region z is completely to the left of region x)
2. supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (region z is completely below region x)

If both of these constraints are true, then as per the definition, region x is in the NE (North East) direction of region z.

Could x also be in the N (North) direction of z? For x N z, we need:
1. supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (region z is completely below region x)
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (The x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z)

I already know (1) holds. But for (2), our constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x) suggests that supx(z) < supx(x) given the strict inequality, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Therefore, x N z is not a valid relation.

Could x be in the NW (North West) direction of z? For x NW z, we need:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (region x is completely to the left of region z)
2. supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (region z is completely below region x)

I already know (2) holds. But for (1), our constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x) suggests the opposite of (1). Therefore, x NW z is not a valid relation.

Let me check x E z. For x E z, we need:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (region z is completely to the left of region x)
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (The y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z)

I already know (1) holds. But for (2), our constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) implies that the top of z is below the bottom of x, which contradicts the condition that the bottom of z is below the bottom of x (infy(z) ≤ infy(x)) and the top of x is below the top of z (supy(x) ≤ supy(z)). Therefore, x E z is not a valid relation.

I'll quickly check the remaining relations:

For x W z, x S z, x SW z, x SE z, and x B z, our derived constraints contradicts their definitions. For instance, x W z requires region x to be completely to the left of region z, which is the opposite of our derived constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Similarly, x S z requires region x to be completely below region z, which is the opposite of our derived constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Therefore, based on our constraints, the only valid cardinal direction relation from region x to region z is NE (North East), i.e., x NE z.

But let's check E (East) a bit more carefully.

For x E z, we need:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (region z is completely to the left of region x)
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (The y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z)

I've derived supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

From supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we can deduce that z and x have a vertical separation, which means they don't share any y coordinates. But for x E z, we need the y-projection of x to be contained within the y-projection of z, which requires a common y coordinate range. Hence, x E z is not a valid relation given our constraints.

After rechecking all the possible cardinal direction relations, I'm confident that the only valid relation from region x to region z is NE (North East).

Actually, I still want to re-check one more time because I still feel like I'm missing something. Let's check more carefully.

We're told that:
1. Region x is B (bounding box) of region y.
2. Region y is NE (North East) of region z.

From these, I tried to deduce the possible relations between region x and region z.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ⟹ supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ⟹ supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These constraints mean that region z is completely to the left and below region x.

Let's check the definition of each cardinal direction relation using these constraints:

1. x NW z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The second condition is satisfied, but the first one contradicts our derived constraints. So, x NW z is ruled out.

2. x N z: We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The first condition is satisfied, but the third one contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) < supx(x). So, x N z is ruled out.

3. x NE z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Both are satisfied by our derived constraints. So, x NE z is a valid relation.

4. x W z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The first condition contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x W z is ruled out.

5. x B z: We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The first condition is compatible with our derived constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x) only if supx(z) = infx(x), but the second condition contradicts this derived constraint. So, x B z is ruled out.

6. x E z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The first two conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints, but the third condition doesn't necessarily hold. Specifically, from supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we know that supy(z) < supy(x) (since infy(x) < supy(x)), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x E z is ruled out.

7. x SW z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Both conditions contradict our derived constraints. So, x SW z is ruled out.

8. x S z: We need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The first condition contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x S z is ruled out.

9. x SE z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first condition is satisfied, but the second one contradicts our derived constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x SE z is ruled out.

In conclusion, only one relation, x NE z, is compatible with our derived constraints. This means region x is in the North East direction of region z.

Hmm, maybe I'm overthinking this, but I'm a bit concerned about the case where region z might be away from region x, but region x and region y could still overlap. Let's revisit our constraints and re-analyze.

Actually, let's change how I approach this problem. I'll think about it graphically. The problem specifies:
1. Region x is B (bounding box) of region y.
2. Region y is NE (North East) of region z.

Let's visualize what this means. For a region to be B of another region, it means it's contained within the bounding box of that region. For a region to be NE of another region, it means it's to the North-East of that region. So:

1. Region x is contained within the bounding box of region y.
2. Region y is to the North-East of region z.

Given these constraints, region z is to the South-West of region y. And region x is inside the bounding box of region y. This means region z is even further South-West of region x. From the perspective of region x, region z is to its South-West. Conversely, from the perspective of region z, region x is to its North-East.

Therefore, the relation is x NE z.

But actually, this is not that simple. Just because region x is inside the bounding box of region y and region y is to the North-East of region z, it doesn't automatically mean that region z is directly to the South-West of region x. Let's reconsider.

Given that region x is inside the bounding box of region y, there's a range of positions region x can occupy. Similarly, there's a range of positions region z can occupy such that region y is to its North-East.

The question is asking for all possible relations between region x and region z, given the constraints.

Let's think about the extremes:
1. What if region x is at the South-West corner of region y's bounding box?
   - In this scenario, region x would still be to the North-East of region z, albeit closer to it than region y.
   
2. What if region x is at the North-East corner of region y's bounding box?
   - Again, region x would be to the North-East of region z, but further away than in scenario 1.

Wait, I'm making a mistake. Let's be more specific about what "x B y" means. It means the bounding box of region x is inside the bounding box of region y. It doesn't mean region x is inside region y. So, region x's bounding box is inside region y's bounding box. And region y is to the North-East of region z.

Let's really focus on the constraints to determine the relation between region x and region z.

From "x B y", we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  (1)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  (2)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (3)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)  (4)

From "y NE z", we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  (5)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  (6)

Now, let's use these to constrain the relation between region x and region z.

From (5) and (1), we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ⟹ supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  (7)

From (6) and (3), we get:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ⟹ supy(z) ≤ infy(x)  (8)

Constraints (7) and (8) tell us:
- The rightmost edge of region z is to the left of the leftmost edge of region x.
- The topmost edge of region z is below the bottommost edge of region x.

This is exactly the definition of the NE relation from the perspective of region x. In other words, region x is to the North-East of region z, or x NE z.

And, as I've verified by checking all the other possible relations, this is the only relation that's consistent with the given constraints.

To be sure, I've established that:
1. region z is completely to the left of region x (supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
2. region z is completely below region x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

These two constraints, combined, mean that region x is to the North-East of region z, i.e., x NE z.

Thus, the answer is: the possible relation between region x and region z is NE (North East).

Actually, that's wrong. I was confused about the directional relations definitions. The definition "a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)" means that if region a is in the NE direction of region b, then the rightmost point of b is to the left of the leftmost point of a, and the topmost point of b is below the bottommost point of a. In other words, region a is to the North-East of region b.

Given the constraints I've derived:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (The rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x)

According to the definition of NE, these constraints tell us that x is in the NE direction of z, or x NE z. That's the relation from x's perspective to z.

So I was right the first time. But I still feel like there's something I'm missing. What if I play with some ideas? 

Let's reconsider the problem. Given that:
1. Region x is B (inside the bounding box) of region y.
2. Region y is NE (North East) of region z.

We want to determine the relation of region x to region z.

From our analysis, I've established that:
1. The rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x. (supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
2. The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x. (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

These constraints fit the definition of a NE relation, where region x is in the NE direction of region z. In other words, region x is to the North-East of region z.

But for the past few minutes, I've been thinking if there are any other possible relations that fit these constraints. There aren't.

So, the relation of region x to region z is NE (North East).

Actually, wait a moment. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

If region x is B of region y, then:
- Region x is inside the bounding box of region y.

If region y is NE of region z, then:
- Region y is to the North-East of region z.

Now, given that region y is to the North-East of region z, and region x is inside region y's bounding box, we need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

The relation "x B y" means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x), i.e., the leftmost point of x is to the right of or at the same position as the leftmost point of y.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y), i.e., the rightmost point of x is to the left of or at the same position as the rightmost point of y.
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x), i.e., the bottommost point of x is above or at the same position as the bottommost point of y.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y), i.e., the topmost point of x is below or at the same position as the topmost point of y.

The relation "y NE z" means:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y), i.e., the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of y.
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y), i.e., the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of y.

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x. This is a property of NE, SE, or E.
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x. This is a property of NE, NW, or N.

Considering both conditions, the only common relation is NE. Thus, region x is in the North-East direction of region z, i.e., x NE z.

So NE is the answer. To make sure I haven't missed anything, let's think again.

The constraints we have can be summarized as:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (region z is completely to the left of region x)
2. supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (region z is completely below region x)

These constraints, combined, align with the definition of NE, meaning region x is to the North-East of region z, i.e., x NE z.

On reflection, this is the only relation consistent with the constraints. So my answer is still NE.

On second thought, have I made any other errors? Let me check the interpretation of the B (bounding box) relation again. "x B y" means the bounding box of x is inside the bounding box of y. In other words, the entire region x is contained inside the bounding box of region y. Let's make sure my interpretation is correct.

According to the problem statement, "a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)." This means that region a is inside the bounding box of region b, or the bounding box of region a is contained inside the bounding box of region b. So its infima and suprema are contained by the infima and suprema of the bounding box. That is: the bounding box of b entirely contains the bounding box of a.

My understanding earlier is correct. "x B y" means region x is inside the bounding box of region y. Or the bounding box of region x is inside the bounding box of region y.

Given that I've correctly understood the interpretations, the derived constraints are:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (region z is completely to the left of region x)
2. supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (region z is completely below region x)

And as we've already examined, these constraints align with the definition of the NE relation, meaning region x is to the North-East of region z, i.e., x NE z.

Thus, to the question "If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", the answer is NE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These derived constraints tell us that:
1. The rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x
2. The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x

According to the definitions, these constraints perfectly match the NE relation.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.
