PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. We have:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is S of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of N and S from the given information:

- x N y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y S z if and only if supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's see what constraints these two relations impose on x and z:

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x is not completely to the right of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is not completely to the left of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is not completely to the right of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is not completely to the left of z)

Now, let's try to deduce the constraints between x and z:

For the y-coordinate:
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z)

This doesn't give us a direct constraint between infy(x) and infy(z). x could be above, below, or at the same level as z in terms of the y-coordinate.

For the x-coordinate:
- From x N y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means that the x-coordinate range of x is contained within the x-coordinate range of z. In other words, x is not completely to the left or right of z.

So, based on these constraints, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. N (North): This is possible if supy(z) <= infy(x). Since we know supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x), it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x), making x North of z.

2. NE (North East): This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But we've derived that supx(x) <= supx(z), which means it's not possible for supx(z) <= infx(x). So, NE is not a possible relation.

3. E (East): This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But as mentioned, it's not possible for supx(z) <= infx(x). So, E is not a possible relation.

4. SE (South East): This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Again, it's not possible for supx(z) <= infx(x). So, SE is not a possible relation.

5. S (South): This is possible if supy(x) <= infy(z). We don't have direct constraints on supy(x) relative to infy(z). So, S is a potential relation.

6. SW (South West): This is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we've derived that infx(z) <= infx(x), which means it's not possible for supx(x) <= infx(z). So, SW is not a possible relation.

7. W (West): This is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But it's not possible for supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not a possible relation.

8. NW (North West): This is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But it's not possible for supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not a possible relation.

9. B (Bounding Box): This is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've already derived that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We don't have direct constraints on infy(z) relative to infy(x) or supy(x) relative to supy(z). So, B is a potential relation.

Let me check my reasoning. Actually, I'm not being careful enough with the constraints. 

Let's more carefully analyze the constraints from x N y and y S z:

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

So x and z could have the following relationships:

For y-coordinate:
- infy(x) can be anything relative to infy(z)
- supy(x) can be anything relative to supy(z)

For x-coordinate:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

So for x-coordinates, x is "inside" z (in the project to the x-axis).

Now, knowing all this, let me systematically go through the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. N (North): x is North of z if supy(z) <= infy(x). We have supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This means x could be North of z, but doesn't have to be. It depends on the relative positions of infy(x) and supy(z).

2. NE (North East): x is North East of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We know that supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which means it's not possible for supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be North East of z.

3. E (East): x is East of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Similar to above, it's not possible for supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be East of z.

4. SE (South East): x is South East of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Again, it's not possible for supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be South East of z.

5. S (South): x is South of z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We know that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) doesn't follow from our given constraints, so it's possible for x to be South of z, but it's not guaranteed.

6. SW (South West): x is South West of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know that infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means it's not possible for supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be South West of z.

7. W (West): x is West of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But it's not possible for supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be West of z.

8. NW (North West): x is North West of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But it's not possible for supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be North West of z.

9. B (Bounding Box): x is inside the bounding box of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The other two conditions, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), don't follow from our given constraints. So, x could be inside the bounding box of z, but it's not guaranteed.

So the possible relations between region x and region z from our analysis are:
- x N z (North)
- x S z (South)
- x B z (Inside the bounding box)

Let me check my analysis by double checking some cases:

Actually, let me be more precise about constraints between x and z.

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

When we combine, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

So we know that x is "inside" z with respect to x-coordinates (the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z). However, we don't have any direct comparison between the y-coordinates of x and z. The y-coordinate of x could be above, below, or overlap with the y-coordinate of z.

Given these constraints, let's go through the cardinal direction relations:

1. N (North): x is North of z if supy(z) <= infy(x). This doesn't follow from our constraints, but it's possible. So, x could be North of z.

2. S (South): x is South of z if supy(x) <= infy(z). This doesn't follow from our constraints, but it's possible. So, x could be South of z.

3. NE, E, SE, SW, W, NW: For all of these directions, there's a constraint that involves either supx(z) <= infx(x) or supx(x) <= infx(z). Given our constraints infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), these conditions can't be satisfied. So, x cannot be in any of these directions relative to z.

4. B (Bounding Box): x is inside the bounding box of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know the first two conditions are satisfied. The last two don't follow from our constraints, but they can be satisfied depending on the exact positions of x and z. So, x could be inside the bounding box of z.

Let me check a slightly different approach to make sure my reasoning is correct.

Given that x is North of y and y is South of z, we can draw some simple diagrams to visualize the possibilities.

First, with x-coordinates, we know that the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z:
```
   z: |_________________|
   x:     |______|
```

For y-coordinates, we know:
1. y is below x (supy(y) <= infy(x))
2. y is below z (supy(y) <= infy(z))

So y is below both x and z. But there are different possibilities for x relative to z in terms of y-coordinate:

Possibility 1: x is above z
```
   x: |_____|
   z:       |_____|
   y:             |_____|
```
In this case, x is North of z.

Possibility 2: x overlaps with z in the y-coordinate
```
   x: |_____|
   z:    |_____|
   y:          |_____|
```
In this case, x is inside the bounding box of z.

Possibility 3: x is below z
```
   z: |_____|
   x:    |_____|
   y:          |_____|
```
In this case, x is South of z.

Wait, I got confused a bit. Let me be more precise. 

From x N y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x), which means y is strictly below x.

From y S z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z), which means y is strictly below z.

So, in terms of y-coordinates, y is below both x and z. However, the relative positions of x and z can vary.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is strictly above z. This corresponds to the x N z relation.
2. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is strictly below z. This corresponds to the x S z relation.
3. If infy(z) < infy(x) and supy(x) < supy(z), then x and z overlap in the y-coordinate, and x is "inside" z in the y-direction.
4. If infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(z) < supy(x), then z and x overlap in the y-coordinate, and z is "inside" x in the y-direction.
5. Other overlapping cases where neither is fully "inside" the other in the y-direction.

Combined with our knowledge about the x-coordinates (x is "inside" z in the x-direction), Scenario 3 would correspond to x being completely inside the bounding box of z (x B z). Scenarios 4 and 5 would correspond to other cases where x and z overlap but aren't in a standard cardinal direction relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x N z (North)
- x S z (South)
- x B z (Inside the bounding box)
and potentially other overlap relations.

Let me think again to check my logic.

From the definitions given:
- x N y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y S z if and only if supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let me go through the cardinal direction relations and check if they are possible:

1. N (North): x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) doesn't follow from our constraints, but it's possible.
   So, x could be North of z.

2. NE (North East): x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
   So, x cannot be North East of z.

3. E (East): x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
   So, x cannot be East of z.

4. SE (South East): x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
   So, x cannot be South East of z.

5. S (South): x S z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) doesn't follow from our constraints, but it's possible.
   So, x could be South of z.

6. SW (South West): x SW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).
   So, x cannot be South West of z.

7. W (West): x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).
   So, x cannot be West of z.

8. NW (North West): x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).
   So, x cannot be North West of z.

9. B (Bounding Box): x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - The conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) don't follow from our constraints, but they are possible.
   So, x could be inside the bounding box of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z from our analysis are:
- x N z (North)
- x S z (South)
- x B z (Inside the bounding box)

But wait, I need to make sure that the relation satisfies the constraints on the region defined in the problem.

Looking back at the cardinal direction relations, a key aspect is that regions are in REG, which means they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. Regions are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries. 

But, this doesn't change my analysis. The possible relations between region x and region z remain:
- x N z (North)
- x S z (South)
- x B z (Inside the bounding box)

To be completely sure, let me double check this by drawing examples of each scenario.

1. x N z:
With x-coordinates (projections onto the x-axis):
```
   z: |_________________|
   x:     |______|
```
With y-coordinates (projections onto the y-axis):
```
   x: |_____|
            |_____|  <- z
                   |_____|  <- y
```
This scenario is consistent with the given constraints.

2. x S z:
With x-coordinates:
```
   z: |_________________|
   x:     |______|
```
With y-coordinates:
```
            |_____|  <- z
   x: |_____|
                   |_____|  <- y
```
This scenario is consistent with the given constraints.

3. x B z:
With x-coordinates:
```
   z: |_________________|
   x:     |______|
```
With y-coordinates:
```
            |_________________|  <- z
                  |______|  <- x
                            |_____|  <- y
```
This scenario is also consistent with the given constraints.

So, my final answer remains:
The possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B.

Let me double check my work by making sure that the regions can also be in REG.

For region x N z:
```
     +----------+
     |     x    |
     +----------+
          ^
          |
     +----------+
     |     z    |
     +----------+
          ^
          |
     +----------+
     |     y    |
     +----------+
```
These regions can certainly be in REG.

For region x S z:
```
     +----------+
     |     z    |
     +----------+
          ^
          |
     +----------+
     |     x    |
     +----------+
          ^
          |
     +----------+
     |     y    |
     +----------+
```
These regions can also be in REG.

For region x B z:
```
     +------------------------+
     |                        |
     |       +--------+       |
     |       |   x    |       |  <- z
     |       +--------+       |
     |                        |
     +------------------------+
                ^
                |
           +----------+
           |     y    |
           +----------+
```
These regions can also be in REG.

So, my analysis stands: the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B.

But wait, I think I'm forgetting that a cardinal direction relation can be a composite of multiple single-tile relations if the target region falls into multiple tiles.

OK, actually let's be very careful with the problem statement. We are looking for a cardinal direction relation, which is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where:
i) 1 <= k <= 9,
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE},
iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j,
iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

Recall the question:
If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

I've already identified that the possible single-tile relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B. But we also need to consider composite relations. But for this question, I think the possible composite relations would still be the same, as we're asking for "*the* possible relations" between x and z, not "*all* possible relations".

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B.

Wait, I think I'm overthinking this. The question is asking about the possible relations between regions x and z. 

From my analysis, I've determined that x can be:
- North of z (N)
- South of z (S)
- Inside the bounding box of z (B)

So these are the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

So my final answer is: B, N, S.

Actually, I think I need to double check whether we can really have x S z.

From x N y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y S z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).

But from the given constraints, I can't directly infer the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So it's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z) or supy(x) > infy(z).

Let me try a counter-example to check if x S z is truly a possible relation.

Imagine the following y-coordinates:
- infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 8
- infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 5
- infy(z) = 9, supy(z) = 11

With these, we have:
- supy(y) = 5 <= infy(x) = 6, so x N y is satisfied.
- supy(y) = 5 <= infy(z) = 9, so y S z is satisfied.
- But supy(x) = 8 < infy(z) = 9, which means x S z.

So, x S z is indeed a possible relation.

Let's also double check if x N z is a possible relation.

Consider the following y-coordinates:
- infy(x) = 12, supy(x) = 14
- infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 5
- infy(z) = 6, supy(z) = 8

With these, we have:
- supy(y) = 5 <= infy(x) = 12, so x N y is satisfied.
- supy(y) = 5 <= infy(z) = 6, so y S z is satisfied.
- But supy(z) = 8 < infy(x) = 12, which means x N z.

So, x N z is also a possible relation.

And let's verifty if x B z is a possible relation.

Consider the following y-coordinates:
- infy(x) = 8, supy(x) = 10
- infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 5
- infy(z) = 6, supy(z) = 12

With these, we have:
- supy(y) = 5 <= infy(x) = 8, so x N y is satisfied.
- supy(y) = 5 <= infy(z) = 6, so y S z is satisfied.
- Also, infy(z) = 6 < infy(x) = 8 and supy(x) = 10 < supy(z) = 12, which means x is "inside" z in the y-direction.

Combined with the fact that x is "inside" z in the x-direction (established earlier), we have x B z.

So, x B z is a possible relation.

My answer is: N, S, B.

Wait. Let's carefully check what I've been calculating. I've been looking at the relations between regions. Let me double check against the definitions of the tile relations.

Recall the following: x N y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

This is for the relation N. Let's carefully check all of the cases:

x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

We have already established that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible, as I demonstrated in a counter-example. So, x N z is a possible relation.

x S z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

We have already established that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible, as I demonstrated in a counter-example. So, x S z is a possible relation.

x SW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We have established that infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be South West of z.

x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Again, we have established that infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be West of z.

x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

We have established that infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be North West of z.

x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

We have established that supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be North East of z.

x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

We have established that supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be East of z.

x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We have established that supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be South East of z.

x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

We have already established that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are possible, as I demonstrated in a counter-example. So, x B z is a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- x N z (North)
- x S z (South)
- x B z (Inside the bounding box)

Great, I believe I've now verified my answer thoroughly. The possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B.

Wait, I need to further double check to see if other composite relations may be possible. Let's focus on the combined constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

I showed earlier that (from a tile-by-tile perspective) x can be North of z, South of z, or inside the bounding box of z. But I need to check if x can perhaps be spread across multiple tiles, creating a composite relation.

Given that x is "inside" z in the x-direction (i.e., the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z), and the fact that we're talking about regions in REG (which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk), it seems unlikely that x can be in multiple directional tiles relative to z.

However, there's a potential relation I haven't considered: x might straddle both the B and N tiles, or both the B and S tiles. For instance, if part of x is inside the bounding box of z and part of it extends to the North or South.

But this would violate the property that regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. If x is in both the B and N (or S) tiles, it would have to have a more complex shape.

So I remain confident in my conclusion: the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B. These relations are mutually exclusive and cannot be combined for regions in REG.

To final check, let me verify that regions with these relations can indeed be in REG. For a region to be in REG, it must be homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which means it should be closed, connected, and have a connected boundary.

For regions x N z, x S z, and x B z, as I described in my examples, they can indeed be represented as regions in REG. The regions in my examples were all simple shapes, which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk.

So, my final answer is: N, S, B.

Actually, let's check one more thing. My reasoning assumes that a region cannot occupy multiple tiles in the cardinal direction grid. But this isn't necessarily true. A region can be in multiple tiles, and the cardinal direction relation would be a composition of those tiles.

But the question is: Given the constraints, can region x occupy multiple tiles relative to region z?

Given that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z. This means, in terms of x-coordinates, x is "inside" z and can only occupy tiles B, N, or S.

Now, the y-coordinates can vary, and x can be North of z, South of z, or overlap with z in the y-direction. If x is spread out in the y-direction, it's possible that part of x is North of z and part of it is overlapping with z in the y-direction. Similarly, part of x can be South of z and part of it can be overlapping with z.

But are these composite relations (N:B or S:B) valid for regions in REG?

A region in REG is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which means it's a simple, connected region. If part of x is in tile N and part of it is in tile B, and x is in REG, then x is a connected region that spans across both tiles.

So, the possible composite relations might include:
- x N:B z (part of x is North of z, and part of it is inside the bounding box of z)
- x S:B z (part of x is South of z, and part of it is inside the bounding box of z)

Let's verify if these composite relations are possible.

I'll start with x N:B z. Consider the following y-coordinates:
- infy(x) = 8, supy(x) = 12
- infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 5
- infy(z) = 6, supy(z) = 10

With these, we have:
- supy(y) = 5 <= infy(x) = 8, so x N y is satisfied.
- supy(y) = 5 <= infy(z) = 6, so y S z is satisfied.
- We have supy(z) = 10 < supy(x) = 12 and infy(x) = 8 > infy(z) = 6, so part of x is in the N tile and part of it is in the B tile.

This seems conceptually possible, but I'm not sure if a region that spans both N and B tiles can actually be in REG. Let me think about this a bit more.

Actually, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning. The cardinal direction relations N, S, B, etc. are defined for regions, not for individual points within regions. So, a region can't be "part in N and part in B." The relation is for the entire region.

But let's double check the definition of the tile-based cardinal direction relation. If region a is in multiple tiles relative to region b, then the relation is a composite of those tiles.

Recall that the cardinal direction relation is given by: a R1: ... : Rk b, where a corresponds to union(a1, ..., ak), with ai belongs to Ri(b).

So, it's the entire region a that is related to region b, but the relation can be a composition of different tiles if a spans multiple tiles. 

Let's apply this to our context. We have:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

This implies that the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z. So, x cannot extend beyond z in the x-direction.

Now, for the y-direction, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means y is below both x and z, but it doesn't tell us the relative positions of x and z in the y-direction.

Let's consider three cases:
1. If x is entirely above z (i.e., supy(z) < infy(x)), then the relation is x N z.
2. If x is entirely below z (i.e., supy(x) < infy(z)), then the relation is x S z.
3. If x and z overlap in the y-direction (i.e., there's some y-coordinate that's within both x and z), then the relation is more complex.

For the third case, since x is "inside" z in the x-direction, the only tile x can occupy is B. So, the relation would be x B z.

But what if part of x extends above z in the y-direction and another part extends below z? Then, x would span multiple tiles: N, B, and S.

But I realize I'm introducing a hypothetical that won't work given our constraints. If region is connected, since it is already inside z in the x-direction, it can only be in one of the three possible relations: N, S, or B. It can't be in a composite like N:B:S.

So, my original conclusion stands: the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B.

Actually, let me actually try drawing a scenario where x might span multiple tiles relative to z. Our constraint is that the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z.

```
    +----------------+
    |       z        |
+---|----------------|---+
|   |                |   |
|   |                |   |  <- x
+---|----------------|---+
    |                |
    +----------------+
```

In this scenario, x is partly in the N tile, partly in the B tile, and partly in the S tile relative to z. The cardinal direction relation would be x N:B:S z.

But, this scenario violates our constraint that the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z. In the above drawing, x extends beyond z in the x-direction.

Let's try another scenario:

```
      +----------------+
      |       z        |
      |                |
+-----|----------------|-----+
|     |                |     |  <- x
+-----|----------------|-----+
      |                |
      +----------------+
```

But again, this violates our x-coordinate constraint. 

Let's try one more:
```
    +----------------+
    |       z        |
    |                |
    |    +------+    |
    |    |  x   |    |
    |    +------+    |
    |                |
    +----------------+
```

In this scenario, x is entirely within the bounding box of z. The cardinal direction relation would be x B z.

Now, let's try to visualize a scenario where x spans multiple tiles:
```
    +----------------+
    |       z        |
    |                |
    |    +------+    |
    |    |      |    |
    +----+------+----+
         |  x   |
         +------+
```

In this scenario, part of x is inside the bounding box of z, and part of it is below z. This would result in a composite relation x B:S z.

But is this possible given our constraints? Let's check:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): This is satisfied in the above drawing.
- supy(y) <= infy(x): We haven't drawn y, but assuming y is below x, this is satisfied.
- supy(y) <= infy(z): Again, assuming y is below z, this is satisfied.

So, this scenario does seem to satisfy our constraints. The relation would be x B:S z.

Similarly, we can draw a scenario for x B:N z:
```
         +------+
         |  x   |
    +----+------+----+
    |    |      |    |
    |    +------+    |
    |                |
    |       z        |
    +----------------+
```

And again, this seems to satisfy our constraints.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are B, N, S, B:N, and B:S, it seems.

However, I'm a bit uncertain about the composite relations. Let me double check.

The definition of cardinal direction relations allows for a region to be in multiple tiles relative to another region. If a region a is in multiple tiles relative to a region b, then the relation is a composite of those tiles.

In our case, we have established that x can be in the N, S, or B tile relative to z. It can also span multiple tiles, such as B:N or B:S.

But there's another consideration: Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk.

Hmm, its a confusing definition actually, let me think about it carefully for composite relations. The definition says:
"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

So, if a cardinal direction relation is R1: ... : Rk, then the region a is the union of subregions a1, ..., ak, where a1 in in R1(b), ..., ak in in Rk(b).

For the composite relations B:N and B:S, we need to check if it's possible to have a region in REG (which is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk) that spans both the B tile and the N (or S) tile. Given the constraint that the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z, this should be possible.

So, my final answer remains: the possible relations between region x and region z are B, N, S, B:N, and B:S.

Actually, I think I have a mistake somewhere. Let me try once more.

Given:
- x N y
- y S z

I've established that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). I've seen that, for cardinal directions relations, we're partitioning the plane into 9 regions based on the reference region, and then indicating in which regions the primary regions.

So, from infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), we know that, for the x-coordinate, the primary region (x) is included within the projection of the reference region (z) on the x-axis. This means x cannot be in the Western (W, NW, SW) or Eastern tiles (E, NE, SE) relative to z.

The y-coordinates can vary, and x can be in the North tiles (N, NE, NW), South tiles (S, SE, SW), or the bounding box (B) relative to z.

Considering the constraint on the x-coordinate, x can only be in the N, S, or B tile relative to z.

So, I'm less sure about the composite relations. Or rather, I believe N:B and S:B might be possible. Let me double check the definition.

The key thing here is that part iv) of the definition requires that a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG. This means that the union of the subregions must be in REG, which implies that it must be a connected region. For composite relations like B:N or B:S, the union of a region in the B tile and a region in the N (or S) tile can certainly be connected and in REG.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are B, N, S, B:N, and B:S.

Actually, let me make one final check by going through each possible relation.

For x N z: x is entirely above z, and within the lateral bounds of z. This is possible.
For x S z: x is entirely below z, and within the lateral bounds of z. This is possible.
For x B z: x is entirely within the bounding box of z. This is possible.
For x N:B z: Part of x is above z, and part of x is within the bounding box of z. Given the constraint that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), this is possible.
For x S:B z: Part of x is below z, and part of x is within the bounding box of z. Given the constraints, this is possible.

What about other composite relations?
For x N:S z: This would mean part of x is above z and part of it is below z. But since we've established that the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z, x would have to go all the way from above z to below z without intersecting with z. This is not possible for a connected region.
For x N:S:B z: This would mean x spans all three tiles: above z, below z, and within the bounding box of z. Again, for a connected region, x would have to intersect with z, which contradicts the tiles N and S.

So, my final answer is: the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, B, N:B, and B:S.

Actually, I think I wrote some things incorrectly, let me double check the constraint on connected regions.
I don't think N:B or S:B can be a relation if x is connected. If we're viewing the cardinal directions from the tile perspective, then N and B are separated by a boundary. For x to be in both N and B, it would have to cross that boundary, which would make it connected. But the definition of the tiles is such that they are disjoint, so this would be a contradiction. I think I've got confused here.

Let me think about the cardinal directions grid again. Given a reference region b, we divide the plane into 9 tiles: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE. These tiles are disjoint, so a region cannot belong to more than one tile... 

Actually, that's a misconception. A connected region can span multiple tiles. The cardinal direction relation is a description of which tiles a region occupies relative to another region. But each of the 9 cardinal directional tiels is itself a region, and those tiles don't overlap by definition.

OK. Let's step back and think this through systematically.

Given a reference region b, we divide the plane into 9 tiles: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE. A region a can be entirely in one tile, or it can span multiple tiles. If a spans multiple tiles, the cardinal direction relation is a composite of those tiles.

In our case, we have established that the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z. This means x cannot be in the Western or Eastern tiles relative to z.

The y-coordinates can vary, and x can be in the Northern tiles, Southern tiles, or the bounding box tile relative to z.

Considering the constraint on the x-coordinate, x can only be in the N, S, or B tile relative to z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, B, N:B, and B:S.

Ugh, let me think about this. A cardinal direction relation R1: ... : Rk is an expression, where Ri is the tile. For every tile, there's a subregion of the primary region in that tile. The union of the subregions is equal to the primary region, and the union is in REG (connected).

For a composite relation like N:B, part of the primary region (x) is in the N tile and part of it is in the B tile. This is possible if the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z, as we've established. Similarly for B:S.

I think I've been overthinking this. The possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, B, N:B, and B:S.

Another way to think about it is that I'm using the 'RA model', that the primary region is the union of tiels or parts of tiles from the cardinal directional grid. In particular, the primary region is the union of all of the tiles or part of tiles it overlaps with. That seems to match with the description of how the cardinal direction relation is defined.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, B, N:B, and B:S.

Actually, does the definition allows for this? The definition says that there are regions a1, ..., ak, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b), and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG. This implies that each ai is a separate region (in REG), and their union (the primary region) is also in REG. For a composite relation like N:B or B:S, this means part of the primary region x (the a_i's; in the N or S tile) are separated from the part in the B tile. But the union of two separated regions cannot be in REG (homeomorphic to the closed unit disk) unless they are connected. 

So I'm a bit confused about whether composite relations like N:B or B:S are possible. Let me go back to the definition:

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

The definition doesn't say a1, ..., ak are separate. It says they are regions in REG, and their union is also in REG. For composite relations like N:B or B:S to be possible, the subregions in the N/S tile and the B tile must be connected, so their union is a connected region in REG. This is possible if the primary region (x) spans the boundary between the tiles.

OK let's think about this carefully again. The region a is actually the union of the a_i's, there's a constraint that this union is in REG.

Let me think about what's going on. We have the reference region z, and we partition the plane into 9 regions based on z. The primary region x can be in one or more of these 9 regions.

It's a bit confusing, because the definition says that a1, ..., ak are regions in REG, a1 belongs to R1(b)... ok I think I know the issue. a1, ..., ak are hypothetical subregions that correspond to the regions of x that overlap with the tiles of the cardinal grid. These are not separate regions, but subregions of x. The constraint is that the union of these subregions must be in REG (i.e., homeomorphic to the closed unit disk).

For composite relations like N:B or B:S to be possible, the subregions of x in the N/S tile and the B tile must be connected. Given the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which means x is contained within z in the x-direction, I think this is possible.

So if we're done debating this, I think the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, B, N:B, and B:S.

Actually, N:B would mean N tile touches B tile. But N:B is the composition of a1 in N(b) and a2 in B(b). If a1 and a2 are both in REG, and a1 + a2 = x, which is also in REG, I'm having trouble seeing how can a1 and a2 can both be homeomorphic to the unit disk, and have their union be homeomorphic too. 

But even if there are separate "subregions," what the definition is saying is that there exist a1 and a2 such that a1 is in N(b), a2 is in B(b), and a1 union a2 is in REG. For the union to be in REG, a1 and a2 need to be connected. For a composite relation like N:B, the part of x in the N tile (a1) and the part in the B tile (a2) must be connected.

I think the reason I'm having a difficulty is because the definition doesn't strictly say the a_i's are pairwise disjoint... but actually since the R_i's are distinct, the a_i's must be disjoint as well. So its a bit confusing. But assuming there's no issue with the cardinal direction relation definition,I'd just go with N, S, B, N:B, and B:S.

Actually, I realized my confusion. The a_i's are the subregions of x that correspond to the regions of x that overlap with the tiles of the cardinal grid. The constraint is that the union of these subregions must be in REG.

I'm overthinking it too much.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: N, S, B, N:B, and B:S.

There's no issue with cardinal relation definition...

So my final answer is: N, S, B, N:B, B:S

Wait, I realize there's a subtle detail I'm missing. B:S and N:B both mean the primary object (x) is in both tiles, which are adjacent. They can definitely be connected. (Or "homeomorphic to the closed unit disk").

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are indeed N, S, B, N:B, and B:S. I'm reasonably confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the logical consequences of the given information.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is S of region z

From the definition of N (North):
- x N y means: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From the definition of S (South):
- y S z means: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

This means x is "inside" z with respect to x-coordinates (the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z).

However, for y-coordinates, we only know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

These constraints allow for multiple possibilities for the relation between x and z:

1. N: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), x is completely above z
2. S: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is completely below z
3. B: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), x is inside z's bounding box
4. N:B: If part of x is north of z and part is inside z's bounding box
5. B:S: If part of x is inside z's bounding box and part is south of z

The possible relations are: N, S, B, N:B, B:S
