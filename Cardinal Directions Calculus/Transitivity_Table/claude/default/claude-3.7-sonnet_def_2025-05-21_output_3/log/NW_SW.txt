PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We have the following information:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's first recall the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now let's apply these definitions to our scenario:

x NW y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

y SW z means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now I'll use these constraints to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From x NW y and y SW z, we can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y SW z)

By transitivity, we can say:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

This tells us that x is to the west of z in some sense (either W, NW, or SW).

Now let's look at the y-coordinates:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

These constraints don't directly give us a transitive relation between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z).

Let's think about what these constraints mean geometrically. If region x is to the northwest of region y, and region y is to the southwest of region z, then region x could be:

1. Northwest of z (NW): This would be the case if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
2. West of z (W): This would be the case if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
3. North of z (N): This would be the case if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
4. Northeast of z (NE): This would be the case if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
5. Inside the bounding box of z (B): This would be the case if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's check each of these possibilities against our constraints.

1. Northwest of z (NW): 
   - We derived that supx(x) <= infx(z), which is consistent with the definition of NW.
   - We need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x). We don't have direct constraints for this, but it's possible.
   So NW is a possible relation.

2. West of z (W):
   - We derived that supx(x) <= infx(z), which is consistent with the definition of W.
   - We need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We don't have direct constraints for these, but they're possible.
   So W is a possible relation.

3. North of z (N):
   - We derived that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) needed for N.
   So N is not a possible relation.

4. Northeast of z (NE):
   - We derived that supx(x) <= infx(z), but NE requires supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction.
   So NE is not a possible relation.

5. Inside the bounding box of z (B):
   - We derived that supx(x) <= infx(z), but B requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which is a contradiction.
   So B is not a possible relation.

I realize I made an error. Let me revisit the scenario with a more careful approach.

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y SW z)
- By transitivity, supx(x) <= infx(z)

- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

Now, there are several possibilities for the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z):
- infy(x) < infy(z)
- infy(x) = infy(z)
- infy(x) > infy(z)

Let's examine each case:

Case 1: infy(x) < infy(z)
This means supy(z) could potentially be less than infy(x), which would make x NW of z.

I think I started to get confused. Let me take a step back and approach this problem differently.

We have two regions, x and z, and we want to find the possible cardinal direction relations between them. We know that x is NW of y and y is SW of z.

Let's simplify and consider a single point in each region:
- Let (x_x, x_y) be a point in region x
- Let (y_x, y_y) be a point in region y
- Let (z_x, z_y) be a point in region z

Given the cardinal direction relations, we know:
- x_x < y_x (from x NW y)
- x_y > y_y (from x NW y)
- y_x < z_x (from y SW z)
- y_y < z_y (from y SW z)

By transitivity, we have:
- x_x < z_x (from x_x < y_x and y_x < z_x)

But for the y-coordinates, we can't directly derive a relation between x_y and z_y. We know x_y > y_y and y_y < z_y, but this doesn't tell us how x_y compares to z_y. This means x_y could be less than, equal to, or greater than z_y.

Let's consider each case:

1. x_y > z_y: In this case, x is to the northwest of z, so the relation is NW.
2. x_y = z_y: In this case, x is directly to the west of z, so the relation is W.
3. x_y < z_y: In this case, x is to the southwest of z, so the relation is SW.

So the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Let me double-check this by considering the constraints on the bounding boxes of the regions.

From x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

By transitivity, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

This confirms that x is to the west of z in some sense.

Now, for the y-coordinates, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

As I noticed earlier, this doesn't directly tell us how infy(x) compares to infy(z) or how supy(x) compares to supy(z).

Let's consider all the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z and check if they're consistent with our constraints.

For the relation x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is not contradicted by our constraints)
So NW is possible.

For the relation x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (which are not contradicted by our constraints)
So W is possible.

For the relation x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is not contradicted by our constraints)
So SW is possible.

For the relation x N z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z))
So N is not possible.

For the relation x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z))
So NE is not possible.

For the relation x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z))
So E is not possible.

For the relation x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z))
So SE is not possible.

For the relation x S z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z))
So S is not possible.

For the relation x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z))
So B is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, let me recheck if SW is really possible. For SW, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). Let's see if this is consistent with our constraints.

From x NW y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x). This doesn't directly tell us about supy(x) and infy(z).

From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). Again, this doesn't directly tell us about supy(x) and infy(z).

So, the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) is not contradicted by our given constraints. That means SW is indeed a possible relation between x and z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, I should be more careful about this. 

Let me think again using an example. Suppose we have points as follows:
- x is at (1, 5)
- y is at (3, 2)
- z is at (5, 4)

Here, x is NW of y (to the left and above), and y is SW of z (to the left and below). In this case, x is W of z (to the left and at the same level).

Let me try another example:
- x is at (1, 6)
- y is at (3, 2)
- z is at (5, 4)

Here, x is NW of y, and y is SW of z. In this case, x is NW of z (to the left and above).

Let me try yet another example:
- x is at (1, 3)
- y is at (3, 2)
- z is at (5, 4)

Here, x is NW of y, and y is SW of z. In this case, x is SW of z (to the left and below).

So, based on these examples, the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW. This is consistent with our earlier analysis.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. I think I need to be explicit about the constraints on the regions, not just points within the regions.

For cardinal direction relations, we use the boundaries of the regions:
- infx(a) is the smallest x-coordinate in region a
- supx(a) is the largest x-coordinate in region a
- infy(a) is the smallest y-coordinate in region a
- supy(a) is the largest y-coordinate in region a

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

By transitivity, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

But we don't have direct constraints on the vertical relationship between x and z. Let's consider the possible vertical relationships:

1. x is above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)): This gives x NW z.
2. x and z overlap vertically (infy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= supy(x)): This gives x W z.
3. x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)): This gives x SW z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW, which is consistent with our earlier analysis.

To summarize, given that x is NW of y and y is SW of z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Let's confirm whether we've check all the possibilities. There are 9 possible cardinal direction relations between two regions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B. We've checked all 9 and found that only NW, W, and SW are consistent with our constraints.

So, the answer is:
The possible relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, wait. Let me think more carefully about this.

I think I need to be even more precise about the constraints.

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

By transitivity, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

Given the original constraints, we can't directly derive a relation between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z). However, we can derive constraints on the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z by checking if each relation is consistent with our constraints.

For the relation x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

For the relation x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For the relation x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

For the relation x N z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Since we've derived that supx(x) <= infx(z), and one of the conditions for N is infx(z) <= infx(x), which would imply infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z), leading to infx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z), which is a very specific case. So, in general, N is not a possible relation.

Similarly, the relations NE, E, SE, S, and B would all require conditions that contradict our derived constraint supx(x) <= infx(z).

So, the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

I think I made an error. Let's be even more careful.

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Let's derive constraints on the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinates, by transitivity, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(y) < supx(y) (by definition of infx and supx)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y SW z)
- So, supx(x) <= infx(z)

For the y-coordinates, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

Let's denote the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z as CDR(x, z). We know that supx(x) <= infx(z), so x must be to the left of z. This narrows down the possible relations to NW, W, and SW. Let's check if all of these are consistent with our constraints:

For NW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

For W, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For SW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's think carefully about the y-coordinate constraint. From x NW y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x). From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). But these constraints don't directly tell us how infy(x) relates to infy(z). Let's consider all the possibilities:

If infy(z) < infy(x), then supy(z) could be less than infy(x), which would make x NW of z. But supy(z) could also be greater than infy(x), making x W of z. We are told that regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk and they are closed, meaning they contain their boundaries. But it's still possible for supy(z) to be less than infy(x), equal to infy(x), or greater than infy(x).

If infy(z) = infy(x), then supy(z) can't be less than infy(x). In this case, x could be W of z.

If infy(z) > infy(x), then supy(x) could be less than infy(z), making x SW of z. But supy(x) could also be greater than infy(z), which doesn't directly correspond to one of our cardinal direction relations. Let me revisit the definitions.

Actually, this is getting a bit too complicated. Let me simplify. We proved that supx(x) <= infx(z), which ensures that x is to the "left" of z. So the possible cardinal directions are N, NW, W, SW, and S. But since the regions are in REG (they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk), they are connected and have connected boundaries, so if x is to the north of z, it can't also be to the south, and vice versa. So the possible directions are NW, W, and SW.

Let's double-check this. For NW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've shown that supx(x) <= infx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x) is not contradicted by our given constraints. So NW is possible.

For W, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've shown that supx(x) <= infx(z), and the other conditions are not contradicted by our given constraints. So W is possible.

For SW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've shown that supx(x) <= infx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z) is not contradicted by our given constraints. So SW is possible.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, I should double-check our constraints on the "westness" relationship. I had derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which ensures that x is to the "west" of z. This means the possible cardinal directions are NW, W, and SW. But let me check more carefully to ensure that x and z can't overlap longitudinally (which would make the direction N, B, or S).

From x NW y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y). From y SW z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z). By transitivity, we have supx(x) <= infx(z). For x to be N, B, or S of z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But this would mean infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z), implying infx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z). This is a very specific case where x is a line segment at the western boundary of z, which isn't a general cardinal direction.

So, the general cardinal direction relations from x to z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, let me be a bit more precise here, just to be sure.

From x NW y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

By transitivity, we get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

So, supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the west of z. This rules out N, NE, E, SE, S, and B as possible relations. So, the possible relations are NW, W, and SW.

For completeness, let me check if each of these is consistent with our constraints:

For NW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

The constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) is not directly contradicted by our given constraints. So, NW is possible.

For W, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

These constraints on the y-coordinates are not directly contradicted by our given constraints. So, W is possible.

For SW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've derived)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) is not directly contradicted by our given constraints. So, SW is possible.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW. And I don't think there's any possibility for x to be N, NE, E, SE, S, or B of z, because these relations would contradict the constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) that we've derived.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

By transitivity, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This means x must be strictly to the west of z, which narrows the possible relations to NW, W, and SW.

Let's check if each is consistent with our constraints:

1. NW: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
2. W: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
3. SW: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

None of these y-coordinate constraints are contradicted by our given information, so all three relations are possible.

The answer is: NW, W, SW
