PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's use the definitions provided to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y
- y is SW of z

Let's analyze what these relations mean:

1. x is N of y means that:
   supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

2. y is SW of z means that:
   supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, I need to determine what relation(s) x could have with z.

From x being N of y, I know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at the same position as y's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at the same position as y's right boundary)

From y being SW of z, I know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, let's combine these constraints to determine the possible relationship between x and z:

From 1 and 2, I know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from 1)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from 2)

This means both x and z are above y, but I can't directly compare infy(x) and infy(z) from these constraints.

From 1 and 2, I also know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from 1)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from 2)

Combining the last two, I get:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

This implies that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. 

So, from the constraints, I know that x is to the left of z. But the vertical relationship can vary. Let me work through the possible cases:

1. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NORTH of z. This would give a NW relation.
2. If infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(z), then x and z overlap vertically. Given that x is to the left of z, this would give a W relation.
3. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is SOUTH of z. This would give a SW relation.

Wait, let me double-check this. I'm not sure if I've correctly interpreted all the constraints.

From x being N of y, I get:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

From y being SW of z, I get:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, I can't directly compare infy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that infy(x) > infy(z), infy(x) = infy(z), or infy(x) < infy(z).

Similarly, I can't directly compare supy(x) and supy(z).

However, I do know that x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)), as derived earlier.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. NW: If x is NORTH and WEST of z.
2. W: If x is WEST of z and overlaps vertically with z.
3. SW: If x is SOUTH and WEST of z.

However, let's be more precise and try to understand if there are more constraints we can derive.

From x being N of y, I get:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y being SW of z, I get:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's combine them.

From the first set of conditions, supy(y) <= infy(x). 
From the second set, supy(y) <= infy(z).

This doesn't give me a direct comparison between infy(x) and infy(z).

From the first set, supx(x) <= supx(y).
From the second set, supx(y) <= infx(z).

Combining these, I get supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Since I can't derive a definitive vertical relationship between x and z, the possible relations are:

1. NW: If x is NORTH and WEST of z.
2. W: If x is WEST of z and overlaps vertically with z.
3. SW: If x is SOUTH and WEST of z.

Actually, maybe I can derive more constraints. Let's see.

From x being N of y, I get:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

From y being SW of z, I get:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Wait, I've been taking a more direct approach, but I think I should be more systematic. Let's define the coordinates of the bounding boxes of the three regions:

For region x:
- Left boundary: infx(x)
- Right boundary: supx(x)
- Bottom boundary: infy(x)
- Top boundary: supy(x)

For region y:
- Left boundary: infx(y)
- Right boundary: supx(y)
- Bottom boundary: infy(y)
- Top boundary: supy(y)

For region z:
- Left boundary: infx(z)
- Right boundary: supx(z)
- Bottom boundary: infy(z)
- Top boundary: supy(z)

Now, let's use these coordinates with the given relations:

x is N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

y is SW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

I've already derived that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is WEST of z.

From x being N of y, I know that supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y being SW of z, I know that supy(y) <= infy(z).

Given these two constraints, I can't derive a definitive vertical relationship between x and z. For example:
- If supy(y) is much smaller than both infy(x) and infy(z), then both x and z could be far above y, but their relative positions to each other could vary.

To make this clearer, let me consider specific examples:

1. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NORTH of z. This would give a NW relation.
2. If infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(z), then x and z overlap vertically. Given that x is to the left of z, this would give a W relation.
3. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is SOUTH of z. This would give a SW relation.

Actually, the statements above made sense. Let me trace through these cases with a specific example:

Consider region y with bounds:
- infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 3.

For x to be N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) => 3 <= infy(x) => infy(x) >= 3
- infx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= infx(x) => infx(x) >= 1
- supx(x) <= supx(y) => supx(x) <= 3

So, x might have bounds:
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6.

For y to be SW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) => 3 <= infx(z) => infx(z) >= 3
- supy(y) <= infy(z) => 3 <= infy(z) => infy(z) >= 3

So, z might have bounds:
- infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 4, supy(z) = 6.

In this specific example, x is NW of z because supx(x) = 3 < infx(z) = 4 (x is WEST of z) and infy(x) = 4 = infy(z) and supy(x) = 6 = supy(z) (x is at the same height as z, but I'll consider this as overlapping vertically, which would make the relation W).

Let's try another example:

For y, the same bounds.
For x, let's choose bounds:
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6.
For z, let's choose bounds:
- infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 7, supy(z) = 9.

In this case, x is still WEST of z, but now x is SOUTH of z (supy(x) = 6 < infy(z) = 7). This gives a SW relation.

One more example:

For y, the same bounds.
For x, let's choose bounds:
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 9.
For z, let's choose bounds:
- infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 6, supy(z) = 8.

In this case, x is WEST of z and x partially overlaps with z vertically, because infy(x) = 4 < supy(z) = 8 and supy(x) = 9 > infy(z) = 6. This gives a W relation.

One more example for clarity:

For y, the same bounds.
For x, let's choose bounds:
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 8, supy(x) = 10.
For z, let's choose bounds:
- infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 4, supy(z) = 6.

In this case, x is WEST of z and x is NORTH of z (infy(x) = 8 > supy(z) = 6). This gives a NW relation.

Based on these examples and the constraints derived from the given relations, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. NW: If x is NORTH and WEST of z.
2. W: If x is WEST of z and overlaps vertically with z.
3. SW: If x is SOUTH and WEST of z.

Actually, I realize I still have to check the case of x B z, which means x is inside the bounding box of z. 

For x to be inside the bounding box of z (relation B), we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally contained within z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically contained within z)

But we already know that supx(x) <= infx(z) (from the constraints derived), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for x to be inside the bounding box of z. Therefore, x cannot be inside the bounding box of z (relation B).

Let's also check if the relation could be N, NE, E, SE, or S.

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally aligned with z)

But from the constraints, I know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for x to be N of z. Therefore, x cannot be N of z.

Similarly, for x to be NE of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)

Again, the constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for x to be NE of z. Therefore, x cannot be NE of z.

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically aligned with z)

Once more, the constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for x to be E of z. Therefore, x cannot be E of z.

For x to be SE of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)

The constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for x to be SE of z. Therefore, x cannot be SE of z.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally aligned with z)

Again, the constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for x to be S of z. Therefore, x cannot be S of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. NW: If x is NORTH and WEST of z.
2. W: If x is WEST of z and overlaps vertically with z.
3. SW: If x is SOUTH and WEST of z.

Let me double-check this by considering specific examples for each relation.

Given:
- x is N of y, which means supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).
- y is SW of z, which means supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Example 1: Testing NW relation between x and z

Let y have coordinates infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 3.

For x to be N of y, we need:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) => 3 <= infy(x) => infy(x) >= 3
- infx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= infx(x) => infx(x) >= 1
- supx(x) <= supx(y) => supx(x) <= 3

Let's choose x with coordinates infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6.

For y to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) => 3 <= infx(z) => infx(z) >= 3
- supy(y) <= infy(z) => 3 <= infy(z) => infy(z) >= 3

Let's choose z with coordinates infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 5.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- Is x WEST of z? Yes, because supx(x) = 3 < infx(z) = 4.
- Is x NORTH of z? Yes, because infy(x) = 4 and supy(z) = 5. Wait, actually, this doesn't work. I got my comparison wrong. For x to be NORTH of z, I would need supy(z) <= infy(x), which isn't true here.

Let me correct my example for the NW relation.

Example 1 (corrected): Testing NW relation between x and z

Let y have coordinates infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 3.

Let's choose x with coordinates infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 7.

Let's choose z with coordinates infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 4.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- Is x WEST of z? Yes, because supx(x) = 3 < infx(z) = 4.
- Is x NORTH of z? Yes, because supy(z) = 4 < infy(x) = 5.

Thus, x is NW of z in this example.

Example 2: Testing W relation between x and z

With the same y, let's choose x with coordinates infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6.

And z with coordinates infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 5.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- Is x WEST of z? Yes, because supx(x) = 3 < infx(z) = 4.
- Does x overlap with z vertically? 
  - infy(x) = 4, which is between infy(z) = 3 and supy(z) = 5, so there's vertical overlap.

Thus, x is W of z in this example.

Example 3: Testing SW relation between x and z

With the same y, let's choose x with coordinates infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 5.

And z with coordinates infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 6, supy(z) = 8.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- Is x WEST of z? Yes, because supx(x) = 3 < infx(z) = 4.
- Is x SOUTH of z? Yes, because supy(x) = 5 < infy(z) = 6.

Thus, x is SW of z in this example.

Just to be sure, let me trace through the constraints once more:

From x being N of y, I get:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y being SW of z, I get:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining the constraints that involve supx(x), I get:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

This means supx(x) <= infx(z), which indicates that x is WEST of z. There's no other constraint I can derive from the given relations that would further restrict the relationship between x and z.

Based on the constraints and examples, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. NW: If x is NORTH and WEST of z.
2. W: If x is WEST of z and overlaps vertically with z.
3. SW: If x is SOUTH and WEST of z.

This exhausts all the possible relations.

Alright, after careful analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- NW (North West)
- W (West)
- SW (South West)

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y
- y is SW of z

From "x is N of y," I know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally aligned with y)

From "y is SW of z," I know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

This means x must be to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).

However, the vertical relationship between x and z can vary:
1. x could be north of z (NW relation)
2. x could overlap vertically with z (W relation)
3. x could be south of z (SW relation)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, SW
