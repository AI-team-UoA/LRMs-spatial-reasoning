PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know:
- Region x is N of region y: x N y
- Region y is NE of region z: y NE z

We want to find possible relations between x and z.

Let's recall the definitions:
- x N y means: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y NE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From x N y:
1. supy(y) <= infy(x) - x is above y
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) - x's left boundary is at or to the right of y's left boundary
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's right boundary is at or to the left of y's right boundary

From y NE z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) - y is to the right of z
2. supy(z) <= infy(y) - y is above z

Now let's try to determine possible relations between x and z.

First, considering the vertical position:
- From x N y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y NE z, we have supy(z) <= infy(y)
- By transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This tells us that x is above z (vertically)

Second, considering the horizontal position:
- From x N y, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y NE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y)
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- This tells us that x is to the right of z (horizontally)

So we have:
- x is above z (vertically)
- x is to the right of z (horizontally)

Given these constraints, x could be in:
- NE of z: because x is above and to the right of z

Let's check if any other cardinal direction is possible:

- N of z? For this, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). 
  We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means supx(x) > supx(z) is likely. This contradicts the requirement for N relation.

- E of z? For this, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we have) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means supy(x) > supy(z) is likely. This contradicts the requirement for E relation.

- NW of z? For this, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have), but we also know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z, not to the left. This contradicts the requirement for NW relation.

- W, SW, S, SE, B? These all have constraints that conflict with what we know about the positions of x and z.

Wait, let me double-check the final conclusion by setting up a specific example.

Let's say:
- Region z has coordinates (0,0) to (10,10)
- Region y is NE of z, so it could have coordinates (15,15) to (25,25)
- Region x is N of y, so it could have coordinates (16,30) to (24,40)

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
- x's x-range is (16,24)
- z's x-range is (0,10)
- Since 10 < 16, x is strictly to the right of z
- x's y-range is (30,40)
- z's y-range is (0,10)
- Since 10 < 30, x is strictly above z

So indeed, x is NE of z.

Let me try with slightly different coordinates to make sure:
- Region z has coordinates (0,0) to (10,10)
- Region y is NE of z, so it could have coordinates (15,15) to (25,25)
- Region x is N of y, it could have coordinates (14,30) to (26,40)

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
- x's x-range is (14,26)
- z's x-range is (0,10)
- Since 10 < 14, x is strictly to the right of z
- x's y-range is (30,40)
- z's y-range is (0,10)
- Since 10 < 30, x is strictly above z

So once again, x is NE of z.

Actually, let me reconsider. I think I made a mistake in my initial analysis.

If y is NE of z, then there are various possibilities for the exact position of y relative to z. Similarly, if x is N of y, there are various possibilities for the exact position of x relative to y.

Let me reconsider more carefully:

From y NE z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) - y is to the right of z
2. supy(z) <= infy(y) - y is above z

From x N y:
1. supy(y) <= infy(x) - x is above y
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) - x's left boundary is at or to the right of y's left boundary
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's right boundary is at or to the left of y's right boundary

So, for the vertical position of x relative to z:
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y NE z: supy(z) <= infy(y)
- By transitivity: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This confirms x is above z.

For the horizontal position of x relative to z:
- From x N y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
- By transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- This means z is to the left of x.

Given that x is above z and z is to the left of x (equivalently, x is to the right of z), x must be in the NE direction of z.

Now, let's check if there are any other possible relations:

For N relation: We would need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), so x is strictly to the right of z, which contradicts the requirements for N relation.

For NW relation: We would need supx(x) <= infx(z). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is strictly to the right of z, not to the left. This contradicts the requirement for NW relation.

For E relation: We would need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), so x is strictly above z, which contradicts the requirements for E relation.

For other relations (S, SE, SW, W, B): All of these relations have requirements that contradict what we know about the relative positions of x and z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Actually, let me be more careful with my analysis. Let's see if there are any other possibilities.

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) - x is above y
- infx(y) <= infx(x) - x's left boundary is at or to the right of y's left boundary
- supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's right boundary is at or to the left of y's right boundary

From y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) - y is to the right of z
- supy(z) <= infy(y) - y is above z

From the above, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) - x is above z
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) - z is to the left of x (or x is to the right of z)

Now, let's check all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. N relation: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means supx(x) > infx(x) > supx(z), contradicting the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z). So, N relation is not possible.

2. NE relation: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these are satisfied. So, NE relation is possible.

3. E relation: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we have), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means supy(x) > infy(x) > supy(z), contradicting the requirement supy(x) <= supy(z). So, E relation is not possible.

4. SE relation: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), contradicting the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z). So, SE relation is not possible.

5. S relation: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), contradicting the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z). So, S relation is not possible.

6. SW relation: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), contradicting the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, SW relation is not possible.

7. W relation: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), contradicting the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W relation is not possible.

8. NW relation: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), contradicting the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW relation is not possible.

9. B relation: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(x) > supx(z), contradicting the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) together. So, B relation is not possible.

Based on the above analysis, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NE.

So, the answer is: NE.

Actually, wait. There's a possibility I've overlooked. When I said:

From x N y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) - x's left boundary is at or to the right of y's left boundary
- supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's right boundary is at or to the left of y's right boundary

And combined with:

From y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) - y is to the right of z

I derived:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) - z is to the left of x

But there's more to the horizontal constraint. Let's reconsider the full definition:

x N y means: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

This means the x-projection of x is "contained" in the x-projection of y. It might not be the entire x-projection, but it doesn't extend beyond y's x-projection.

y NE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) - z is strictly to the left of y
- infx(y) <= infx(x) - x's left boundary is at or to the right of y's left boundary
- supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's right boundary is at or to the left of y's right boundary

By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means z is strictly to the left of x.

But we can't determine how supx(x) compares to infx(z) or supx(z). All we know is that x is somewhere to the right of z, but we don't know the exact horizontal alignment. 

This means there are multiple possible cardinal directions for x relative to z. It could be NE or NW or N.

Wait, I don't think the NW relation is possible. Let's check:

NW requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). 

We know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means z is strictly to the left of x. This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) for the NW relation. So, NW is not possible.

Similarly, let's check if the N relation is possible:

N requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

We know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(x) > supx(z). This contradicts the requirements infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) together. So, N is not possible.

So, it seems that NE is indeed the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, I think I see the issue with my analysis. I was assuming that the x-projection of x is "contained" in the x-projection of y based on the definition of x N y. But that's not entirely correct.

x N y means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) - x is strictly above y
- infx(y) <= infx(x) - x's left boundary is at or to the right of y's left boundary
- supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's right boundary is at or to the left of y's right boundary

This doesn't mean the x-projection of x is "contained" in the x-projection of y. It just means that the x-projection of x is "sandwiched" between the left and right boundaries of y.

Let me think more carefully about the possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- x N y
- y NE z

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) - x is above y
- infx(y) <= infx(x) - x's left boundary is at or to the right of y's left boundary
- supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's right boundary is at or to the left of y's right boundary

From y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) - y is to the right of z
- supy(z) <= infy(y) - y is above z

I'm going to examine the constraints from x N y and y NE z and see what they imply about the possible relation between x and z.

Vertically:
- From y NE z: supy(z) <= infy(y)
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- By transitivity: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)

This confirms that x is above z.

Horizontally:
- From y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
- From x N y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- By transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means z is to the left of x. But we still don't know the exact horizontal alignment of x and z.

Let's check each possible relation:

1. N: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x and z don't horizontally overlap. This contradicts the requirements for the N relation. So, N is not possible.

2. NE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these are satisfied. So, NE is possible.

3. E: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we have), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x and z don't vertically overlap. This contradicts the requirements for the E relation. So, E is not possible.

4. SE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means supy(x) > infy(x) > supy(z). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z). So, SE is not possible.

5. S: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z). So, S is not possible.

6. SW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, SW is not possible.

7. W: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not possible.

8. NW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not possible.

9. B: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x and z don't horizontally overlap. This contradicts the requirements for the B relation. So, B is not possible.

Based on the above analysis, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NE.

Actually, wait. I think I'm making a mistake in my analysis of the constraints.

x N y means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) - x is above y
- infx(y) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's x-projection is "contained" within y's x-projection

y NE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) - y is to the right of z
- supy(z) <= infy(y) - y is above z

The fact that the x-projection of x is "contained" within y's x-projection could lead to different horizontal arrangements between x and z.

Let's consider a specific example to better understand the constraints:

Assume z has coordinates (0,0) to (10,10), and y is NE of z, so y could have coordinates (15,15) to (25,25).

Given that x is N of y, x could have various coordinates, as long as:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) - let's say infy(x) = 30, so x's y-range is (30,40)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(y) - this means x's x-range is "contained" within y's x-range of (15,25)

Let's consider three possibilities for x:
1. x has x-range (15,25), which is the full x-range of y
2. x has x-range (15,20), which is the left part of y's x-range
3. x has x-range (20,25), which is the right part of y's x-range

In all three cases, x is N of y. Now, let's determine the relation between x and z for each case:

1. x has x-range (15,25) and y-range (30,40):
   - z has x-range (0,10) and y-range (0,10)
   - x is above z (vertically)
   - x is to the right of z (horizontally)
   - This means x is NE of z.

2. x has x-range (15,20) and y-range (30,40):
   - z has x-range (0,10) and y-range (0,10)
   - x is above z (vertically)
   - x is to the right of z (horizontally)
   - This means x is NE of z.

3. x has x-range (20,25) and y-range (30,40):
   - z has x-range (0,10) and y-range (0,10)
   - x is above z (vertically)
   - x is to the right of z (horizontally)
   - This means x is NE of z.

It seems that, regardless of the specific position of x as long as it satisfies the N relation with y, x is NE of z.

Actually, the problem is more general than the specific example. As long as: 
- z is SW of y (equivalent to y is NE of z)
- x is N of y

Then x has to be NE of z. This is because:
- x is above y (from x N y) and y is above z (from y NE z), so x is above z.
- x's x-range is "contained" within y's x-range (from x N y), and y is to the right of z (from y NE z), so x is to the right of z.

Wait, there's a mathematical mistake in my analysis. I've been thinking that if x's x-range is "contained" within y's x-range, then x is to the right of z. But that's not necessarily true. Let me be more precise:

From y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) - y is to the right of z

From x N y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's x-range is "contained" within y's x-range

By transitivity:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) - z is to the left of x

So, x is to the right of z.

From y NE z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) - y is above z

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) - x is above y

By transitivity:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) - z is below x

So, x is above z.

Given that x is to the right of z and x is above z, the relation between x and z is NE.

I think the answer is: NE.

Actually, let me think again. I've been making a mistake in the translation of "x is N of y" to the constraints on the projections. Let me restate the definitions more carefully:

x N y means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) - x is strictly above y
- infx(y) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's x-projection is "contained" within y's x-projection

In plain English, this means x is directly above y, with x possibly narrower than y horizontally, but not wider.

y NE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) - y is strictly to the right of z
- supy(z) <= infy(y) - y is strictly above z

In plain English, this means y is diagonally above and to the right of z.

Given these, let's think about the constraints on x relative to z:

From y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) - z is to the left of y
- supy(z) <= infy(y) - z is below y

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) - x is above y
- infx(y) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(y) - x's x-projection is "contained" within y's x-projection

By transitivity:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) - z is below x

Now, for the horizontal relationship:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) - z is to the left of y
- infx(y) <= infx(x) - x's left boundary is at or to the right of y's left boundary

By transitivity:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) - z is to the left of x

So, vertically, x is above z. Horizontally, z is to the left of x, which means x is to the right of z.

Given that x is above z and x is to the right of z, the relation between x and z is NE.

So, the answer is: NE.

Actually, I need to double-check this.

Let's be meticulous and consider the constraints more carefully.
I know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) -- x is strictly above y
- infx(y) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(y) -- x's x-projection is "contained" within y's x-projection
- supx(z) <= infx(y) -- y is strictly to the right of z
- supy(z) <= infy(y) -- y is strictly above z

Looking at the vertical position first:
- From supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) 
- By transitivity: supy(z) <= infy(x) 
- This means x is strictly above z.

Looking at the horizontal position:
- From supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x) 
- By transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(x) 
- This means x is strictly to the right of z.

Given that x is strictly above z and x is strictly to the right of z, the relation between x and z is NE.

So, the answer is: NE.

Actually I should approach the problem a bit differently.

We know:
- x N y (x is North of y)
- y NE z (y is Northeast of z)

Let's use the properties of these cardinal directions to determine the possible relations between x and z.

x N y means:
- x is directly above y.
- The x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y.

y NE z means:
- y is diagonally above and to the right of z.
- y has no overlap with z.

Let's try to visualize this situation and see if x can be in any position relative to z other than NE.

Suppose we place z at the origin, that is, at the point (0, 0). Since y is NE of z, y would be somewhere in the top-right quadrant, say at (5, 5). The left-bottom corner of y would be at (5, 5) and the right-top corner of y would be at (10, 10).

Now, since x is N of y, x would be directly above y. Let's say the left-bottom corner of x is at (6, 12) and the right-top corner of x is at (9, 15).

In this scenario, x would be in the NE direction relative to z. Let's see if x can be placed in any other cardinal direction with respect to z while still maintaining the given constraints.

- N of z? For this, x would need to be directly above z, which means the x-projection of x should include the x-projection of z. However, since y is NE of z, the x-projections of y and z don't overlap. And since the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y, the x-projections of x and z also don't overlap. So, x can't be N of z.

- NW of z? For this, x would need to be to the left of z. But since the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y, and the x-projection of y is to the right of the x-projection of z, x can't be to the left of z. So, x can't be NW of z.

- NE of z? For this, x would need to be above and to the right of z. From our constraints, x is above y (which is above z), and the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y (which is to the right of z). So, x is NE of z.

- E of z? For this, x would need to be directly to the right of z, with some vertical overlap. But since x is above y, and y is above z, x and z don't have any vertical overlap. So, x can't be E of z.

- Similarly, x can't be SE, S, SW, W, or B of z due to the constraints.

It seems that the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

So the answer is:
Cardinal direction relation between x and z: NE.

Wait, let's just check one more time to make sure there are no other possibilities.

Given:
- x N y (x is North of y)
- y NE z (y is Northeast of z)

Recall the definitions:
- x N y means: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y NE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- From y NE z: supy(z) <= infy(y)
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- By transitivity: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This means x is strictly above z.

- From y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
- From x N y: infx(y) <= infx(x)
- By transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- This means z is strictly to the left of x (or x is strictly to the right of z).

Given these constraints, let's systematically check each cardinal direction relation:

- N relation: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but also supx(z) <= infx(x), which means there's no horizontal overlap between x and z. This contradicts the requirements for N relation. So, N is not possible.

- NE relation: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these are satisfied. So, NE is possible.

- E relation: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means there's no vertical overlap between x and z. This contradicts the requirements for E relation. So, E is not possible.

- SE relation: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z). So, SE is not possible.

- S relation: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z). So, S is not possible.

- SW relation: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, SW is not possible.

- W relation: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not possible.

- NW relation: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not possible.

- B relation: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means there's no horizontal overlap between x and z. This contradicts the requirements for B relation. So, B is not possible.

So from our thorough analysis, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NE.

The answer is:
Cardinal direction relation between x and z: NE.

Actually, let's make sure by trying a simple example with concrete regions.

Let's consider:
- z as the region from (0, 0) to (10, 10)
- y as the region from (20, 20) to (30, 30) (which is NE of z)
- x as the region from (22, 40) to (28, 50) (which is N of y)

Let's verify the relations:
- y is NE of z: supx(z) = 10 <= infx(y) = 20, and supy(z) = 10 <= infy(y) = 20. Checks out.
- x is N of y: supy(y) = 30 <= infy(x) = 40, infx(y) = 20 <= infx(x) = 22, and supx(x) = 28 <= supx(y) = 30. Checks out.

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
- supx(z) = 10 <= infx(x) = 22, which means x is strictly to the right of z.
- supy(z) = 10 <= infy(x) = 40, which means x is strictly above z.

Given that x is strictly above and to the right of z, the relation between x and z is NE.

So, the answer is:
Cardinal direction relation between x and z: NE.

Actually wait a minute. Let me approach the problem slightly differently.

We want to know the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that:
- x is N of y
- y is NE of z

Let's use the transitivity properties of cardinal direction relations to determine this.

If we have a region a with relation R to region b, and region b with relation S to region c, then the relation between a and c is a subset of the composition of R and S.

In our case, we have:
- x N y (x is North of y)
- y NE z (y is Northeast of z)

We want to find:
- x ? z

Based on the composition of cardinal direction relations, N composed with NE can result in either:
- N, if the North region shifts directly upwards from the Northeast region.
- NE, if the North region includes some rightward shift from the Northeast region.

Therefore, based on the composition rules, the possible relations between x and z could be either N or NE.

But earlier, we showed that the N relation is not possible due to the constraints. Specifically, since y is strictly to the right of z (from y NE z) and x's x-projection is "contained" within y's x-projection (from x N y), x and z don't have any horizontal overlap, which is required for the N relation.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

The answer is:
Cardinal direction relation between x and z: NE.

Actually, it seems like I'm making this more convoluted than it should be. Let me walk myself through the problem step by step, using spatial reasoning instead of just algebraic definitions.

Given:
- x N y (x is North of y)
- y NE z (y is Northeast of z)

Step 1: Understand the constraint "x N y".
- This means x is directly above y.
- The x-projection (horizontal span) of x is contained within the x-projection of y.

Step 2: Understand the constraint "y NE z".
- This means y is diagonally above and to the right of z.
- The regions y and z don't overlap.

Step 3: Using spatial reasoning, determine the possible positions of x relative to z.
- Since y is NE of z, y is above and to the right of z.
- Since x is N of y, x is above y.
- So, transitively, x is above z.
- Also, since y is to the right of z, and x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection, x is to the right of z.
- Given that x is above and to the right of z, the relation between x and z is NE.

I think the result is:
Cardinal direction relation between x and z: NE.

Let me just make extra sure by revisiting the definitions of the cardinal directions.

Cardinal direction relations are defined using the minimum bounding box of a region. The basic cardinal direction relations are defined as follows:

a B b: Means that region a is inside the bounding box of region b.
a N b: Means that region a is north of region b.
a NE b: Means that region a is northeast of region b.
a E b: Means that region a is east of region b.
a SE b: Means that region a is southeast of region b.
a S b: Means that region a is south of region b.
a SW b: Means that region a is southwest of region b.
a W b: Means that region a is west of region b.
a NW b: Means that region a is northwest of region b.

Let's use the definitions of N and NE to derive possible relations between x and z:

x N y means: 
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is at/right of y's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right boundary is at/left of y's right boundary)

y NE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)

Given that x is above z and x is to the right of z, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

So, the answer is:
Cardinal direction relation between x and z: NE.

Actually, let me verify that I understand the definitions correctly. The problem statement gives us the following definitions for cardinal directions:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
This means a is south of b, with a's x-projection contained within b's x-projection.

a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
This means a is southwest of b, with no overlap in both x and y projections.

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
This means a is west of b, with a's y-projection contained within b's y-projection.

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
This means a is northwest of b, with no overlap in both x and y projections.

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
This means a is north of b, with a's x-projection contained within b's x-projection.

a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
This means a is northeast of b, with no overlap in both x and y projections.

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
This means a is east of b, with a's y-projection contained within b's y-projection.

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
This means a is southeast of b, with no overlap in both x and y projections.

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
This means a is inside the bounding box of b.

Based on these definitions, let's compute the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Given:
- x N y (which means supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))
- y NE z (which means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y))

Transitivity, vertically:
- From supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we get supy(z) <= infy(x).
- This means z is below x (or x is above z).

Transitivity, horizontally:
- From supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), we get supx(z) <= infx(x).
- This means z is to the left of x (or x is to the right of z).

Given that x is above z and x is to the right of z, a natural conclusion would be that x is NE of z (equivalently, z is SW of x).

Let's check if the definition of NE applies: a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

For x NE z, we'd have: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

We've already established both of these conditions from transitivity. So, x is indeed NE of z.

Let's verify the definitions again:

As per the problem statement, NE (Northeast) is defined as:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

I've verified the definition for NE, and based on the constraints from "x N y" and "y NE z", it's the only cardinal direction relation that can hold between x and z.

Actually, I think the definitions I'm using in my analysis are slightly different. Let me restate the definitions given in the problem:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Given:
- x N y, means supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y NE z, means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, I derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (vertically, x is above z)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (horizontally, z is to the left of x, or x is to the right of z)

For x to be NE of z, I need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both conditions are met, so x is NE of z.

So the answer is:

The possible relations between region x and region z is: NE.

Actually, let's double-check one more time to make sure. We knew:

- supy(z) <= infy(x) (from transitivity)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (from transitivity)

Let's check each possible cardinal direction relation:

1. N: We need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but we also know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means supx(x) > infx(x) > supx(z), contradicting the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z). So, N is not possible.

2. NE: We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these are satisfied. So, NE is possible.

3. E: We need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means supy(x) > infy(x) > supy(z), contradicting the requirement supy(x) <= supy(z). So, E is not possible.

4. SE: We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), contradicting the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z). So, SE is not possible.

5. S: We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), contradicting the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z). So, S is not possible.

6. SW: We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), contradicting the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, SW is not possible.

7. W: We need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), contradicting the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not possible.

8. NW: We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), contradicting the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not possible.

9. B: We need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means supx(x) > infx(x) > supx(z), contradicting the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z). So, B is not possible.

So it turns out the answer I arrived at is correct: the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NE.

The answer is therefore:
The possible relation between region x and region z is: NE.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is North of region y, and region y is Northeast of region z.

First, let me recall the definitions:
- x N y means: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's analyze what these constraints tell us about the position of x relative to z:

**Vertical relationship:**
- From y NE z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- By transitivity: supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
This tells us x is above z.

**Horizontal relationship:**
- From y NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- From x N y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- By transitivity: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
This tells us z is to the left of x (or x is to the right of z).

Given that x is above z and x is to the right of z, I need to check if this satisfies the definition of NE:
- For x NE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- Both conditions are met based on our analysis above.

Let me verify no other cardinal direction is possible:
- N requires horizontal overlap, but we've established z is strictly to the left of x
- NW requires x to be to the left of z, but we know x is to the right of z
- Other directions (E, SE, S, SW, W, B) all contradict our established constraints

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: NE
