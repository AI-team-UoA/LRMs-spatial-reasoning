PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This question asks us to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that:
1. Region x is SW of region y
2. Region y is NE of region z

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

First, if x is SW of y, then:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

Second, if y is NE of z, then:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the west of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

From the conditions above, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z. Let's consider all possibilities:

1. If x is to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)):
   a. If x is to the south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), then x is SW of z.
   b. If x overlaps with z in the y-direction, x could be W of z.
   c. If z is to the south of x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), then x is NW of z.

2. If x overlaps with z in the x-direction:
   a. If x is to the south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), then x is S of z.
   b. If x overlaps with z in both x and y directions, x could be B (bounding box) of z or vice versa, or they could partially overlap.
   c. If z is to the south of x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), then x is N of z.

3. If z is to the west of x (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)):
   a. If x is to the south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), then x is SE of z.
   b. If x overlaps with z in the y-direction, x could be E of z.
   c. If z is to the south of x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), then x is NE of z.

Now, given the constraints from the problem, not all of these possibilities are feasible.

Actually, let me re-think this more carefully. It's a constraint satisfaction problem where we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints that x is SW of y and y is NE of z.

Let's use a coordinate system to simplify:
- If x is SW of y, then the x-coordinates of region x are all less than the minimum x-coordinate of y, and the y-coordinates of region x are all less than the minimum y-coordinate of y.
- If y is NE of z, then the x-coordinates of y are all greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinates of y are all greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.

Given these constraints, let's place the regions on the coordinate system:
- Region z: Let's place it at the origin. The maximum x-coordinate of z is, say, at the point (a, 0) and the maximum y-coordinate is at (0, b), where a and b are positive values.
- Region y: The minimum x-coordinate of y must be greater than a, and the minimum y-coordinate of y must be greater than b. So, y might start at the point (a+p, b+q), where p and q are positive values.
- Region x: The maximum x-coordinate of x must be less than a+p, and the maximum y-coordinate of x must be less than b+q.

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, we need to compare their coordinates.

1. If the maximum x-coordinate of x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z, then x is to the west of z (this would be part of the W, NW, or SW relation). But this is not possible because we've established that z is at the origin, so the minimum x-coordinate of z is 0, and all coordinates are positive.

2. If the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z, then x is to the south of z (this would be part of the S, SW, or SE relation). Again, this isn't possible for the same reason as above.

3. If the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, then x is to the east of z (this would be part of the E, NE, or SE relation). This is possible if x is placed to the right of z but still to the left of y.

4. If the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, then x is to the north of z (this would be part of the N, NW, or NE relation). This is possible if x is placed above z but still below y.

5. If x overlaps with z in both the x and y directions, then x and z have a more complex relationship, possibly involving B.

Given the constraints, it's possible for x to be E, SE, NE, N, or B of z. It can also be NW, W, or SW if x's coordinates extend into negative values. The only relation that might not be possible is S, because if x is only to the south of z, it wouldn't be SW of y (it would be S or SE of y).

Actually, I've been thinking about this in a way that restricts the position of x too much. Let me re-evaluate:

Given:
- x is SW of y
- y is NE of z

We know:
- For x to be SW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- For y to be NE of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Given these constraints, where can x be in relation to z?

The constraints tell us that y is to the northeast of both x and z. But they don't directly constrain the relationship between x and z. 

Let's think geometrically: If you imagine a 2D plane with directions, and you place region z at some position, then region y is positioned in the NE direction from z. Region x is positioned in the SW direction from y.

Now, region x can be in various positions relative to region z:
1. x could be to the SW of z, forming a linear arrangement z-x-y from NE to SW.
2. x could be to the W of z, meaning it's aligned with z in the N-S direction but to the west.
3. x could be to the S of z, meaning it's aligned with z in the E-W direction but to the south.
4. x could be to the NW of z, positioning it west of z but north.
5. x could be to the SE of z, positioning it south of z but east.
6. x could be to the E of z, positioning it east of z but aligned in the N-S direction.
7. x could be to the N of z, positioning it north of z but aligned in the E-W direction.
8. x could be to the NE of z, positioning it northeast of z (but still southwest of y).
9. x could have a B relation with z, meaning it's contained within or overlaps with z.

All of these are geometrically possible, as long as x remains SW of y and y remains NE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be any of the 9 cardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

Actually, let's draw this out to make sure. Using a 2D grid:

NW  | N  | NE
----|----|----- 
 W  | B  | E 
----|----|----- 
SW  | S  | SE 

If region z is at the center (B), then region y must be in the NE corner. Region x must be in the SW direction from y.

Now, if y is strictly in the NE corner and x is strictly in the SW direction from y, where can x be relative to z?

If y is at NE and x is SW of y, then x can be anywhere in the following positions: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE.

So, x can have any of the 9 cardinal direction relations with respect to z. Each is geometrically feasible.

Wait, let me think more carefully, and consider the specific constraints of the regions:

Given:
- x is SW of y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is NE of z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Comparing these:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These inequalities don't directly relate x and z. So, I need to think about the possible relationships between x and z based on these constraints.

Actually, I think I was overthinking. Let's approach this problem more straightforwardly. The cardinal direction relations are determined by the relative positions of regions, not by specific distances. So, I should consider the possible positions of x relative to z, given the constraints.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Now, I'm trying to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's place region z at the origin, and think of the plane as divided into 9 regions (the 9 cardinal directions) centered at z. Region y must be in the NE quadrant from z, and region x must be in the SW quadrant from y.

If y is in the NE direction from z, then y could be in a variety of positions within that quadrant. Similarly, if x is in the SW direction from y, x could also be in various positions relative to z.

Let's enumerate these possibilities:

1. If y is close to z (just a bit to the NE), then x, being SW of y, might be in the B, W, S, or SW position relative to z.
2. If y is further NE, then x might be positioned in any of the 9 cardinal directions relative to z, as long as it remains SW of y.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

Actually, let's think of cardinal direction relations a different way. We are working in a 2D space where we can place region z and the minimum bounding rectangle of z. This divides the 2D space into 9 tiles, centered at z: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE.

The problem states that region y is NE of region z. This means y is in the NE tile relative to z.

Now, region x is SW of region y. This means x is in the SW tile relative to y.

But where is x relative to z? This depends on the exact positions of y and x within their respective tiles.

Since y is positioned in the NE tile relative to z, region x being SW of y means it's positioned in the SW tile relative to y. But this doesn't uniquely determine where x is in relation to z.

For instance, if y is near the bottom-left corner of the NE tile, then x (being in the SW tile relative to y) could still be in the NE tile relative to z.

Similarly, if y is in the center of the NE tile, then x (being in the SW tile relative to y) could be in the B tile relative to z.

In fact, depending on the exact positioning of y and the extent of x, x could be in any of the 9 cardinal direction tiles relative to z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

I think I was right. Let me double check by drawing out a few examples:

Let's position z at the reference point Z, with its maximum bounding rectangle:

```
    |
    |
Z---|---
    |
    |
```

And let's place y in the NE quadrant from z (meaning it's in the space diagonally up and to the right of Z):

```
        y
    |  /
    | /
Z---|---
    |
    |
```

Now, x must be in the SW quadrant from y, which means it's in the space diagonally down and to the left of y:

```
        y
    |  /
   x| /
Z---|---
    |
    |
```

In this specific arrangement, x is in the N direction from z.

Let's try another arrangement:

```
           y
    |     /
    |    /
Z---|---
  / |
 /  |
x
```

In this arrangement, x is in the SW direction from z.

Yet another example:

```
           y
    |     /
    |    /
Z---|---
    |
    | 
      x
```

In this arrangement, x is in the S direction from z.

I can draw many more examples, but the point is that x can be in any of the 9 cardinal directions relative to z, as long as it's in the SW direction from y and y is in the NE direction from z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

However, let me consider a geometric approach again to make sure:

Given:
- For x to be SW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- For y to be NE of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Actually, there's information here that I haven't fully utilized. If x is SW of y and y is NE of z, it means:

supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

This gives us the constraints: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z), or between supy(x) and supy(z). Without these direct constraints, x could be in any direction from z, as long as it's SW of y and y is NE of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

Actually, let me think more carefully. This must be a trick question, as I can generate examples for all 9 cardinal directions. But the question is about "possible" relations, meaning I need to determine which of the 9 cardinal directions could describe the relation between x and z. If I can give an example for each, then all are possible.

Let me make sure I understand the definition of a cardinal direction relation. A cardinal direction relation is determined by the position of one region relative to another based on the nine tiles formed by the minimum bounding rectangle of the reference region.

A region a is said to be in the direction R from another region b if a falls within the tile R when the space is divided into 9 tiles centered around region b. The definition for a specific direction is given in the problem.

Let's revisit the constraints:
- x is SW of y, which means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- y is NE of z, which means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Given these, I need to determine which of the 9 cardinal directions could describe the relation from x to z.

Let's draw a comprehensive diagram:

A 2D space that's been divided into 9 tiles centered at z. Since y is NE of z, it's in the top-right quadrant. And since x is SW of y, it's in the bottom-left quadrant from y. But where x is relative to z depends on the positions of y and x within their respective quadrants.

Hmm. Let me consider the problem differently.

For x to be N of z: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), and there's an overlap in the x-direction.
For this to be possible while maintaining x is SW of y and y is NE of z, I'd need:
- z to be south of x, and y to be northeast of z. This is geometrically feasible.

For x to be NE of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
For this to be possible:
- z needs to be to the southwest of x.
- y needs to be to the northeast of z.
- x needs to be to the southwest of y.
This seems to create a linear arrangement, which is geometrically challenging. Let me think about this more carefully.

Actually, for x to be NE of z, x must be in the top-right quadrant from z. And for y to be NE of z, y must also be in the top-right quadrant from z. Additionally, for x to be SW of y, x must be in the bottom-left quadrant from y. So, x must be in the top-right quadrant from z while also being in the bottom-left quadrant from y, which in turn is in the top-right quadrant from z. This is feasible if y is sufficiently far to the northeast from z, and x is positioned correctly.

Similarly, I can try to place regions x, y, and z in various positions while maintaining the constraints, and I'll find that all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

Now let me double check by examining a few more example positions for different cardinal relations:

1. x E z relation: If y is far to the northeast of z, x can be to the east of z while still being southwest of y.
2. x SE z relation: If y is northeast of z, and x is southeast of z but still southwest of y.
3. x B z relation: If y is northeast of both x and z, and x and z overlap or are contained within one another.

I believe all 9 cardinal directions are possible, but let me triple check the NE case, which feels the most constrained:

For x to be NE of z, x must be to the northeast of z. For y to be NE of z, y must also be to the northeast of z. For x to be SW of y, x must be to the southwest of y.

Can these three constraints be satisfied simultaneously? Let's try:
- Place z at the origin (0, 0).
- Place y at (3, 3), which is to the northeast of z.
- Place x at (1, 1), which is to the southwest of y but to the northeast of z.

This satisfies all the constraints, so x can indeed be NE of z.

Therefore, all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

Hold on, let me actually go back to the definitions:

- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, I want to derive the constraints between x and z. Unfortunately, these don't directly give me a relation between x and z. I need to check each cardinal direction relation between x and z and see if it's compatible with the given constraints.

Let's check the N relation between x and z:
- For x N z, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and there's an overlap in the x-direction.

From the given constraints, I have supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), which doesn't directly tell me about the relation between supy(z) and infy(x). So, the N relation can be satisfied or not, depending on specific values.

I could go through all the cardinal directions, but the principle is the same. Without direct constraints between x and z, all nine cardinal directions are possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

Actually, I could be more sophisticated and use algebra to see what constraints are implied by the given conditions:

- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But these don't give me any relation between supx(x) and supx(z), or between supy(x) and supy(z). So, I have no constraints on the relation between x and z.

Now, for completeness, let's check each cardinal direction relation:

1. x N z: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and there's an overlap in the x-direction. Given the constraints, this is possible. Example:
   - z at (0, 0) with size (1, 1).
   - y at (3, 3) with size (1, 1).
   - x at (1, 2) with size (1, 1).

2. x NE z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Given the constraints, this is possible. Example:
   - z at (0, 0) with size (1, 1).
   - y at (3, 3) with size (1, 1).
   - x at (2, 2) with size (1, 1).

3. x E z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and there's an overlap in the y-direction. Given the constraints, this is possible. Example:
   - z at (0, 0) with size (1, 2).
   - y at (3, 3) with size (1, 1).
   - x at (2, 1) with size (1, 1).

4. x SE z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Given the constraints, this is possible. Example:
   - z at (0, 1) with size (1, 1).
   - y at (3, 3) with size (1, 1).
   - x at (2, 0) with size (1, 1).

5. x S z: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and there's an overlap in the x-direction. Given the constraints, this is possible. Example:
   - z at (0, 1) with size (2, 1).
   - y at (3, 3) with size (1, 1).
   - x at (1, 0) with size (1, 1).

6. x SW z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Given the constraints, this is possible. Example:
   - z at (1, 1) with size (1, 1).
   - y at (3, 3) with size (1, 1).
   - x at (0, 0) with size (1, 1).

7. x W z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and there's an overlap in the y-direction. Given the constraints, this is possible. Example:
   - z at (1, 0) with size (1, 2).
   - y at (3, 3) with size (1, 1).
   - x at (0, 1) with size (1, 1).

8. x NW z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Given the constraints, this is possible. Example:
   - z at (1, 0) with size (1, 1).
   - y at (3, 3) with size (1, 1).
   - x at (0, 2) with size (1, 1).

9. x B z: If there's an overlap in both the x and y directions. Given the constraints, this is possible. Example:
   - z at (0, 0) with size (2, 2).
   - y at (3, 3) with size (1, 1).
   - x at (1, 1) with size (1, 1).

So, all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

But this doesn't sound right—there should be some constraints. Let me see again.

Let's think of it this way: both x and z are "southwest" of y, though in potentially different ways. Since x is SW of y, it's to the left and below y. Similarly, since z is "southwest" of y (in the sense that y is NE of z), z is also to the left and below y.

When both regions are to the left and below another region, they can have any spatial relationship with each other, as long as they both remain in that "southwest" region. This is why all 9 cardinal directions are possible.

Actually, I wonder if I'm interpreting the question correctly. When the problem asks for "possible relations between region x and region z," it's asking which of the cardinal directions {N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B} could describe the relation from x to z, given the constraints that x is SW of y and y is NE of z. And as I've explained, all 9 are possible, though the specific relation depends on the exact positions of the regions.

So, in summary, the relations between x and z can be any of: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

Actually, I'm not sure if there is a way to approach this problem more systematically, in case I've missed something. Let's try to draw this out in a more constrained way and see if I can eliminate any of the possible relations.

Given:
- x is SW of y, which means x is to the left of y and below y.
- y is NE of z, which means y is to the right of z and above z.

From the geom,etry, I know that:
- x is in the regions {SW, W, S, B} of y
- y is in the regions {NE, E, N, B} of z

Given these, what can we infer about the possible relations between x and z?

If x is exactly at the SW of y, and y is exactly at the NE of z, then the most likely relation between x and z is that they're in the same position, meaning x has a B relation with z.

But what if x is more to the left of y than necessary? Then x could be W of z. Similarly, if x is more below y than necessary, it could be S of z.

Conversely, if z is more to the left of y than necessary, then x could be E of z. And if z is more below y than necessary, x could be N of z.

There are more complex relationships if both x and z have various positions relative to y. So, indeed, all 9 cardinal directions are possible.

But this still doesn't satisfy me completely.

OK, I've considered the question from multiple angles and have consistently concluded that all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z, given the constraints that region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z. I've provided examples for each of the 9 relations to demonstrate their feasibility.

Therefore, the answer to the question: "If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

All 9 cardinal directions can be the relation from region x to region z, depending on the specific positions of the regions within the constraints.

Actually, you know what? I should check this yet again. Let's check the SW relation to make sure:

For x to be SW of z, I need: 
- x to be to the left of z, meaning supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- x to be below z, meaning supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Can this be satisfied while ensuring that x is SW of y and y is NE of z?

Let's place the regions:
- z at (1, 1) with size (1, 1), so z spans from (1, 1) to (2, 2).
- y at (3, 3) with size (1, 1), so y spans from (3, 3) to (4, 4).
- x at (0, 0) with size (1, 1), so x spans from (0, 0) to (1, 1).

With these positions:
- x is SW of y because supx(x) = 1 ≤ infx(y) = 3 and supy(x) = 1 ≤ infy(y) = 3.
- y is NE of z because supx(z) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 3 and supy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 3.
- x is SW of z because supx(x) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 1 and supy(x) = 1 ≤ infy(z) = 1.

So, the SW relation is possible.

Now, let's check the NE relation to make sure there isn't a constraint I've missed:

For x to be NE of z, I need:
- x to be to the right of z, meaning supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- x to be above z, meaning supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Let's place the regions:
- z at (0, 0) with size (1, 1), so z spans from (0, 0) to (1, 1).
- y at (5, 5) with size (1, 1), so y spans from (5, 5) to (6, 6).
- x at (2, 2) with size (1, 1), so x spans from (2, 2) to (3, 3).

With these positions:
- x is SW of y because supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 5 and supy(x) = 3 ≤ infy(y) = 5.
- y is NE of z because supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(y) = 5 and supy(z) = 1 ≤ infy(y) = 5.
- x is NE of z because supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2 and supy(z) = 1 ≤ infy(x) = 2.

So, the NE relation is possible.

For thoroughness, let's check the B relation:

For x to have a B relation with z, there must be an overlap in both the x and y directions.

Let's place the regions:
- z at (0, 0) with size (2, 2), so z spans from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- y at (5, 5) with size (1, 1), so y spans from (5, 5) to (6, 6).
- x at (1, 1) with size (1, 1), so x spans from (1, 1) to (2, 2).

With these positions:
- x is SW of y because supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 5 and supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 5.
- y is NE of z because supx(z) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 5 and supy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 5.
- x has a B relation with z because there's an overlap in both the x and y directions. Specifically, the regions both share the space between (1, 1) and (2, 2).

So, the B relation is also possible.

After checking all 9 cardinal direction relations, I'm confident that all are possible between region x and region z, given the constraints that region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z.

Therefore, the answer to the question is: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B.

Actually, I just realized a problem with my definition of the B relation above. The B relation isn't about overlap; it's about one region being "bounded" by another. Let me correct my understanding.

According to the problem definition, a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

This means a is contained within the minimum bounding box of b. It's a tighter constraint than just overlap.

So, for x to have a B relation with z, x must be contained within the minimum bounding box of z.

Let's redraw the regions, so that x has a B relation with z:
- z at (0, 0) with size (3, 3), so z spans from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
- y at (5, 5) with size (1, 1), so y spans from (5, 5) to (6, 6).
- x at (1, 1) with size (1, 1), so x spans from (1, 1) to (2, 2).

With these positions:
- x is SW of y because supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 5 and supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 5.
- y is NE of z because supx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 5 and supy(z) = 3 ≤ infy(y) = 5.
- x has a B relation with z because infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 1, and supy(x) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 3.

Hmm, but I realize I might have misunderstood the B relation; if x is contained inside z, then is the relation x B z, or z B x? The definition of B relation says "a B b if a is contained in the minimum bounding box of b". So if x is contained inside the MBB of z, then x B z? Let me revisit the definition more closely.

According to the definition of the B relation, we have:
a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

This means that b must have a larger (or equal) minimum bounding box than a, and a must fit inside the minimum bounding box of b. In other words, a must be bounded by the minimum bounding box of b.

So, for x to have a B relation with z, x must be contained within the minimum bounding box of z. Or, more precisely, the relation is "x B z" if x is bounded by z's minimum bounding box.

Given this, let's redraw the regions, so that x has a B relation with z:
- z at (0, 0) with size (3, 3), so z spans from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
- y at (5, 5) with size (1, 1), so y spans from (5, 5) to (6, 6).
- x at (1, 1) with size (1, 1), so x spans from (1, 1) to (2, 2).

With these positions:
- x is SW of y because supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 5 and supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(y) = 5.
- y is NE of z because supx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 5 and supy(z) = 3 ≤ infy(y) = 5.
- x has a B relation with z because infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 1, and supy(x) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 3. So if I think of it, x is fully contained inside z's minimum bounding box. This means, from the question's definition, the relation is "x B z."

Ok, so "x B z" means that x is fully contained in the minimum bounding rectangle of z. Using the definition more closely:

"a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b),"

Let me denote "a" as "x" and "b" as "z"

"x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z),"

So that's checking if the minimum x value of z is to the left of the minimum x value of x, and so on. That makes sense. 

But I could also denote "a" as "z" and "b" as "x", which gives us the relation "z B x." But that doesn't seem to make sense for the question because we have x SW y and y NE z. The question is asking about the relation between x and z, implying x is the first region mentioned.

So the relation is ""x B z" when x is bounded by the minimum bounding box of z.

Let's go back to checking the nine cardinal directions. I've checked SW, NE, and B, and they all can be satisfied while meeting the constraints that x is SW of y and y is NE of z.

To be exhaustive, I'd need to check the remaining six directions, but the approach would be similar.

Given the consistency across the three relations I've already checked, and the general intuition that both x and z can be in various positions as long as they both are "southwest" of y, I'm confident that all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible.

Therefore, the answer to the question is: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B.

All 9 cardinal direction relations can describe the relationship between region x and region z, given the constraints that region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z.

Therefore, the possible answers are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

This means:
- For x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- For y NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These constraints tell us that both x and z are "southwest" of y in a general sense, but they don't directly constrain the relationship between x and z.

Let me check various possible configurations:

1. x could be SW of z: 
   - Example: z at (1,1), y at (3,3), x at (0,0)

2. x could be W of z:
   - Example: z at (1,0), y at (3,3), x at (0,1)

3. x could be NW of z:
   - Example: z at (1,0), y at (3,3), x at (0,2)

4. x could be N of z:
   - Example: z at (0,0), y at (3,3), x at (1,2)

5. x could be NE of z:
   - Example: z at (0,0), y at (5,5), x at (2,2)

6. x could be E of z:
   - Example: z at (0,1), y at (3,3), x at (2,1)

7. x could be SE of z:
   - Example: z at (0,1), y at (3,3), x at (2,0)

8. x could be S of z:
   - Example: z at (0,1), y at (3,3), x at (1,0)

9. x could be B of z:
   - Example: z spans (0,0) to (3,3), y at (5,5), x spans (1,1) to (2,2)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.
