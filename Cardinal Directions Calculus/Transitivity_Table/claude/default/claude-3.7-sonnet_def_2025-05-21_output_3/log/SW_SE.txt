PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1) Region x is SW of region y, which means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

2) Region y is SE of region z, which means:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z. Let me analyze the constraints:

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Let's see what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
- We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- This means supx(x) and supx(z) are both ≤ infx(y)
- But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between supx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(z) and infx(x)

For the y-coordinates:
- We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- From this, we can deduce that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

The y-coordinate relationship tells us that region x is south of region z (because supy(x) ≤ infy(z)). But for the x-coordinate relationship, we don't have enough information to determine if x is west, east, or directly south of z.

Let's consider the possible cases:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z):
   - This means x is west of z
   - Combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), this means x is SW of z

2. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z):
   - This means x is within the x-projection of z
   - Combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), this means x is S of z

3. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(z) ≤ supx(x):
   - This is a more complex overlap
   - Still combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), this means x is S of z

4. If supx(z) ≤ infx(x):
   - This means x is east of z
   - Combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), this means x is SE of z

So, given the constraints, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- x SW z (if x is west of z)
- x S z (if x overlaps with z in the x-projection)
- x SE z (if x is east of z)

But wait, I need to think more carefully. Let's draw this out more precisely.

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Let's consider the x-coordinate constraints more carefully:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is left of y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is left of y)

So both x and z are to the left of y, but we don't know their relative positions. x could be left of z, z could be left of x, or they could overlap in the x-direction.

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

This transitively means supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x is definitely below z.

So:
- x is definitely south of z
- x could be to the west, east, or aligned with z in the x-direction

In terms of cardinal directions:
- x could be SW of z (if x is west of z)
- x could be S of z (if x and z overlap in the x-direction)
- x could be SE of z (if x is east of z)

Let me check once more by considering all possible arrangements of the three regions on a grid:

First, I need to satisfy the constraints:
1. x is SW of y
2. y is SE of z

For y to be SE of z, y must be to the right of z and below z. For x to be SW of y, x must be to the left of y and below y.

Let's consider the possible locations of x relative to z:

1. If x is to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), then x is SW of z.
2. If x and z overlap in the x-direction, then x is S of z.
3. If x is to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), then x is SE of z.

Wait, I need to be more careful. Let's try to prove this systematically:

Given:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
  - This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is the condition for x being south of z.

For the x-coordinates, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is left of y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is left of y)

This means both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative positions can vary:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is west of z. Combined with x being south of z, this means x is SW of z.
2. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) or other similar configurations, then x and z overlap in the x-projection. Combined with x being south of z, this means x is S of z.
3. If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is east of z. Combined with x being south of z, this means x is SE of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- x SW z
- x S z
- x SE z

I realize that we typically think of SW as being in the southwest quadrant, but in the context of the cardinal direction relations provided, SW specifically means that the region is entirely to the left and entirely below the reference region, not just in the southwest quadrant. Similarly, S means entirely below, and SE means entirely to the right and entirely below.

Let me make sure I'm right by drawing out some possible arrangements that satisfy the given constraints:

Scenario 1 (x SW z):
z is at the top-right.
y is below z and to the right of z (SE of z).
x is to the left of y and below y (SW of y).
Additionally, x is to the left of z and below z (SW of z).

Scenario 2 (x S z):
z is at the top.
y is below z and to the right of z (SE of z).
x is to the left of y and below y (SW of y).
Additionally, x is directly below z (S of z).

Scenario 3 (x SE z):
z is at the top-left.
y is below z and to the right of z (SE of z).
x is to the left of y and below y (SW of y).
Additionally, x is to the right of z and below z (SE of z).

All these scenarios satisfy the given constraints, and they exhaust the possible relative positions of x and z, given the other constraints.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- SW (x is southwest of z)
- S (x is south of z)
- SE (x is southeast of z)

Let me re-focus on the problem:

1) Region x is SW of region y
   - This means x is entirely west and entirely south of y
   - Formally: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

2) Region y is SE of region z
   - This means y is entirely east and entirely south of z
   - Formally: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, I want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

First, let's consider the north-south relationship:
- From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- This means x is entirely south of z

Next, let's consider the east-west relationship:
- We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- This doesn't directly tell us the east-west relationship between x and z

The east-west relationship between x and z could be:

1. x is entirely west of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - If this holds, then x is SW of z

2. x and z overlap in the east-west direction:
   - If infx(z) < supx(x) and infx(x) < supx(z), then x and z overlap in the east-west direction
   - If this holds, then x is S of z

3. x is entirely east of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - If this holds, then x is SE of z

Let's also double-check if other cardinal directions are possible:

- Can x be W of z?
  - This would require supy(z) < supy(x) and infy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - So no, x cannot be W of z

- Can x be NW of z?
  - This would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - So no, x cannot be NW of z

- Can x be N of z?
  - This would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - So no, x cannot be N of z

- Can x be NE of z?
  - This would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - So no, x cannot be NE of z

- Can x be E of z?
  - This would require supy(z) < supy(x) and infy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - So no, x cannot be E of z

- Can x be B (in the bounding box) of z?
  - This would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
  - The second part contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  - So no, x cannot be B of z

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- SW (x is entirely southwest of z)
- S (x is entirely south of z)
- SE (x is entirely southeast of z)

Let me carefully one more time think about the possible regions. 

We are given

x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)


For the possible relationship between x and z, let's look at the y-coordinates first:

Given: 
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

This means: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z) which means x is south of z. So the relationship between x and z must include the "S" direction.

Now, let's look at the x-coordinates:

Given:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)

From these, we can't directly establish a relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z. So, we have the following possibilities:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is west of z. Combined with x being south of z, this means x is SW of z.

2. If there's an overlap in the x-coordinates (i.e., neither x is entirely west of z nor z is entirely west of x), then the relationship is S.

3. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is east of z. Combined with x being south of z, this means x is SE of z.

So the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Let's verify if we're missing anything:

- Can x be B (in the bounding box) of z?
  - This would require infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So no.

- Can x be W of z?
  - This would require infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So no.

- Can x be NW of z?
  - This would require infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So no.

- Can x be N of z?
  - This would require infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So no.

- Can x be NE of z?
  - This would require infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So no.

- Can x be E of z?
  - This would require infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So no.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Actually, I think I need to be more thorough to be sure.

Let's look back at the cardinal direction relations:

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)


Given: 
- x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

We've established that x is south of z because supy(x) <= infy(z).

For x to be S of z:
- We need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)
- But this doesn't help us validate or discount the condition for S.
- So, x can be S of z if the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.

For x to be SW of z:
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We've already established supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)
- It's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z) to hold, so x can be SW of z.

For x to be SE of z:
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We've already established supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)
- It's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x) to hold, so x can be SE of z.

Now, let's check if x can be B of z:
- We need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- We know supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) < infy(z) (since regions are closed and can't share boundaries in this formulation).
- This contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x), so x cannot be B of z.

Using similar reasoning, x cannot be W, NW, N, NE, or E of z because they all would require conditions that contradict supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Actually, I'd like to double-check if x can be S to z. I have the definition:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

We know that supy(x) <= infy(z), so that part checks out.

We need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From the given conditions:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)

These don't directly tell us if infx(z) <= infx(x) or supx(x) <= supx(z), but let's consider a specific scenario:

Suppose x and z are positioned such that:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z.
2. supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z.

In this scenario, x is SW of z.

Now, let's position x more to the right, say infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) < supx(z). Along with supy(x) <= infy(z), this would mean x is S of z.

Further, if we position x even more to the right, say supx(z) <= infx(x), along with supy(x) <= infy(z), this would mean x is SE of z.

All these scenarios are consistent with the given conditions that x is SW of y and y is SE of z. So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

But ah, I think I found the issue! The proper definition of the S relation is:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) **and** supx(a) <= supx(b)

So, for x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (✓ We've established this)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (We need to check if this is consistent with given conditions)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (We need to check if this is consistent with given conditions)

Given:
- x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's see if we can have a scenario where infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) while satisfying the given conditions:

From x SW y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
From y SE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y).

In fact, with the constraints supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), it is possible to have a scenario where x and z are positioned such that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

In such a scenario, the projections of x and z on the x-axis would overlap, with the projection of x being contained within the projection of z.

So, the relation S (South) is indeed possible between x and z.

But wait, I think I made an error. I need to re-check my reasoning for S. Let me check if inferring infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) from the given constraints is correct. We have:

- x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's first understand the positions:
- x is entirely to the left of y (because supx(x) <= infx(y))
- z is entirely to the left of y (because supx(z) <= infx(y))
- x is entirely below y (because supy(x) <= infy(y))
- y is entirely below z (because supy(y) <= infy(z))

For x to be S of z, we need:
1. x to be entirely below z: supy(x) <= infy(z) ✓ (derived from the given conditions)
2. The x-projection of x to be contained within the x-projection of z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Given that both x and z are entirely to the left of y, the x-projections of x and z end before the region of y starts on the x-axis.

Can we have infx(z) <= infx(x)? Yes, z could start more to the left than x.
Can we have supx(x) <= supx(z)? Yes, x could end more to the left than z.

Both of these are consistent with the constraints that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y).

So, the relation S is possible between x and z, along with SW and SE, which I verified earlier.

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE. 

Let me verify this with some examples:

Let's define some arbitrary coordinate ranges for regions x, y, and z that satisfy the given constraints, and then determine the relation between x and z.

Scenario 1 (x SW z):
- y is at (7-9, 3-5)
- z is at (3-6, 6-8)
- x is at (1-2, 1-2)

Here, x SW y (supx(x) = 2 <= 7 = infx(y) and supy(x) = 2 <= 3 = infy(y))
And y SE z (supx(z) = 6 <= 7 = infx(y) and supy(y) = 5 <= 6 = infy(z))

The relation between x and z is SW because supx(x) = 2 <= 3 = infx(z) and supy(x) = 2 <= 6 = infy(z).

Scenario 2 (x S z):
- y is at (7-9, 3-5)
- z is at (3-6, 6-8)
- x is at (4-5, 1-2)

Here, x SW y (supx(x) = 5 <= 7 = infx(y) and supy(x) = 2 <= 3 = infy(y))
And y SE z (supx(z) = 6 <= 7 = infx(y) and supy(y) = 5 <= 6 = infy(z))

The relation between x and z is S because infx(z) = 3 <= 4 = infx(x), supx(x) = 5 <= 6 = supx(z), and supy(x) = 2 <= 6 = infy(z).

Scenario 3 (x SE z):
- y is at (7-9, 3-5)
- z is at (1-2, 6-8)
- x is at (4-5, 1-2)

Here, x SW y (supx(x) = 5 <= 7 = infx(y) and supy(x) = 2 <= 3 = infy(y))
And y SE z (supx(z) = 2 <= 7 = infx(y) and supy(y) = 5 <= 6 = infy(z))

The relation between x and z is SE because supx(z) = 2 <= 4 = infx(x) and supy(x) = 2 <= 6 = infy(z).

All three scenarios satisfy the given constraints and demonstrate that the relations SW, S, and SE are all possible between x and z.

Let's make sure we're not missing anything. I want to double check if other cardinal directions are possible. I need  to check that a relation satisfies the requirements. 

For B:
- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- For x B z, we would need infy(z) <= infy(x) (since z would be the reference region b and x would be a).
- But we know from our derived information that supy(x) <= infy(z).
- Given the definition of regions being closed, connected, and having connected boundaries, it's not possible for both infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true simultaneously, unless x and z touch at exactly the point where supy(x) = infy(z). Even in that case, x would be strictly south of z, not within its bounding box.
- So, x B z is not a possible relation.

For NW:
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- For x NW z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x).
- But we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which, given the definition of regions, conflicts with supy(z) <= infy(x).
- So, x NW z is not a possible relation.

Similarly, using the definitions for N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, and W, and the deduction made that x is south of z (i.e., supy(x) <= infy(z)), the only possible relations are SW, S, and SE.

To verify, let's list the definitions of all single-tile cardinal direction relations we need to consider:

1. a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
2. a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
3. a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
4. a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
5. a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
6. a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
7. a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
8. a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
9. a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For each of these, I'll now check if it's possible for x to have that relation with z given the constraints we've established.

1. For x B z, we'd need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The third condition, infy(z) <= infy(x), conflicts with the earlier derived result that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x B z is not possible.

2. For x S z, we'd need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (This is true from our derived information.)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   The latter two conditions are not contradicted by the given constraints, so x S z is possible.

3. For x SW z, we'd need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (This is true from our derived information.)
   The first condition is not contradicted by the given constraints, so x SW z is possible.

4. For x W z, we'd need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The second condition, infy(z) <= infy(x), conflicts with the earlier derived result that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x W z is not possible.

5. For x NW z, we'd need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   The second condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), conflicts with the earlier derived result that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x NW z is not possible.

6. For x N z, we'd need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   The first condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), conflicts with the earlier derived result that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x N z is not possible.

7. For x NE z, we'd need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   The second condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), conflicts with the earlier derived result that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x NE z is not possible.

8. For x E z, we'd need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The second condition, infy(z) <= infy(x), conflicts with the earlier derived result that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x E z is not possible.

9. For x SE z, we'd need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (This is true from our derived information.)
   The first condition is not contradicted by the given constraints, so x SE z is possible.

So I can confirm that the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and SE.

Actually, let me double check one more thing:

We derived that supy(x) <= infy(z) using the fact that supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).

Let's check if this derivation is correct:
- From x SW y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
- From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z). ✓

So, we correctly derived that supy(x) <= infy(z).

This means that x is below z, which is the key constraint that allows only for the relations SW, S, and SE between x and z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and SE. This answer is clear and is justified by the definitions and the constraints.

In summary, the possible cardinal directions from x to z can be one of:
- SW (x is southwest of z)
- S (x is south of z)
- SE (x is southeast of z)

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

S, SW, SE

I'll explain why:

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- Region y is SE of region z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is definitely south of z

For the east-west relationship:
- Both x and z are to the left of y (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
- But their relative positions to each other can vary:
  * If supx(x) ≤ infx(z): x is SW of z
  * If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z): x is S of z
  * If supx(z) ≤ infx(x): x is SE of z

No other cardinal direction is possible because all others would violate the condition that x must be south of z.
