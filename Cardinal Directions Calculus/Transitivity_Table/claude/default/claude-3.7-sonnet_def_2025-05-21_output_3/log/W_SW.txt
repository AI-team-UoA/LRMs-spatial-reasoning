PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step-by-step. 

We are given:
- Region x is W of region y, which means x W y.
- Region y is SW of region z, which means y SW z.

We need to find all possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall what these relations mean geometrically:

W relation: If a W b, then supx(a) <= infx(b), and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
This means region a is completely to the west of region b, and their y-projections overlap.

SW relation: If a SW b, then supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
This means region a is completely to the southwest of region b.

Now, let's apply these definitions to our scenario:

1. x W y means:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. y SW z means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relation between x and z.

For the x-coordinate: 
We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
So, supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).
This means supx(x) <= infx(z), which is a condition for x to be to the west of z (in some way).

For the y-coordinate:
We know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
So, infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
This means supy(x) <= infy(z), which is a condition for x to be to the south of z (in some way).

Given that supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), we can say that x is to the southwest of z, or x SW z.

But let's check if there are other possible relations:

- x W z would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We've established supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), but we don't have enough information to determine if infy(z) <= infy(x). 
  Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), it seems that the y-projections of x and z might not overlap, contradicting a requirement for W. So, x W z might not be possible.

- x S z would require supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  We've established supy(x) <= infy(z), but we don't have enough information to determine the other conditions.
  Given that supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), it seems that the x-projections of x and z might not overlap, contradicting a requirement for S. So, x S z might not be possible.

- x NW z would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
  We've established supx(x) <= infx(z), but we don't have information to determine if supy(z) <= infy(x). 
  Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), it's unlikely that supy(z) <= infy(x) unless there's a specific configuration. 
  
- Similarly for other relations, we'd need to check each condition.

Actually, let me reanalyze this problem.

Given:
- x W y: This means region x is completely to the west of region y, and their y-projections overlap.
- y SW z: This means region y is completely to the southwest of region z.

Now, let's use a visual approach. Imagine a Cartesian plane with the usual orientations (north is up, east is right).

1. x W y means x is to the left of y, and they have some overlap in the vertical direction.
2. y SW z means y is to the bottom-left of z.

The possible relative positions of x with respect to z could be:
- x could be to the west (left) of z, which is W.
- x could be to the southwest of z, which is SW.
- x could be to the northwest of z, which is NW.

To verify these possibilities, let's create a sample configuration and check the conditions.

For x W z:
- If x is to the west of z, then supx(x) <= infx(z), which is satisfied from our derivation.
- And infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This is where we need to be careful.

Let's sketch some possible configurations:

Configuration 1: x is directly west of y, and y is directly southwest of z.
In this case, the y-projections of x and z might not overlap, making x SW z rather than x W z. But if the y-projection of z extends low enough, then x W z is possible.

Configuration 2: x is southwest of y, and y is directly southwest of z.
In this case, x would definitely be southwest of z, making x SW z.

Configuration 3: x is northwest of y, and y is directly southwest of z.
In this case, it's possible for x to be west of z (x W z), but it could also be NW of z (x NW z) depending on the exact y-coordinates.

It seems like there are multiple possible relations between x and z, but to be more precise, I'll formulate the constraints more mathematically.

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z).
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z).

These constraints are consistent with x being to the southwest of z (x SW z). But they don't exclude other possibilities. Let's check:

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which seems to contradict supy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) unless supy(x) = infy(z).

But this is a special case, and generally, I believe x W z is not always possible. It would be possible in a specific configuration where x, y, and z are positioned such that the y-projections of x and z don't conflict with the W relation.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already established)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), this would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which seems contradictory unless infy(x) = supy(x).

OK, let's just check carefully for all possible relations:

1. x B z: This would mean x is inside z's bounding box, requiring infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've established supx(x) <= infx(z), and in general, infx(z) <= supx(z), so this would mean supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z), which is fine. However, we've also established supy(x) <= infy(z), and in general, infy(z) <= supy(z), so this would mean supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z), which is fine. But for the B relation, we'd also need infy(z) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This is only consistent if infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z), which is a very specific case. Generally, x B z is not possible.

2. x S z: This would mean x is south of z, requiring supy(x) <= infy(z), which we've established. But also infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Given supx(x) <= infx(z), this would mean infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z), which is only consistent if infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z). This is a very specific case. Generally, x S z is not possible.

3. x SE z: This would mean x is southeast of z, requiring supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But this contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) that we've derived. So, x SE z is not possible.

4. x E z: This would mean x is east of z, requiring supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) that we've derived. So, x E z is not possible.

5. x NE z: This would mean x is northeast of z, requiring supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) that we've derived. So, x NE z is not possible.

6. x N z: This would mean x is north of z, requiring supy(z) <= infy(x), which might be possible depending on the specific y-coordinates. But for x N z, we would also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Given supx(x) <= infx(z), this would mean infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z), which is only consistent if infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z). This is a very specific case. Generally, x N z is not possible.

7. x NW z: This would mean x is northwest of z, requiring supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is satisfied. The second condition depends on the specific y-coordinates. Given supy(x) <= infy(z), the constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This is generally inconsistent unless infy(x) = supy(x), which is a specific case. In general, I don't think x NW z is always possible.

8. x W z: This would mean x is west of z, requiring supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is satisfied. Given supy(x) <= infy(z), the constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) would mean infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This is only consistent if infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z), which is a very specific case. Generally, x W z is not possible.

9. x SW z: This would mean x is southwest of z, requiring supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both of these conditions have been established. So, x SW z is possible.

Hmm, I think I'm overthinking this and making the problem more complex than it needs to be. 

Let's approach it more simply. Given:
- Region x is W of region y.
- Region y is SW of region z.

If we look at this on a 2D plane:
- W of y means x is to the left of y with some vertical overlap.
- SW of z means y is to the bottom-left of z.

Let's place these regions on a grid and see what the relationship between x and z is.

First, let's consider the x-coordinate (horizontal position):
- x is to the left of y (x W y).
- y is to the left of z (y SW z).
- Therefore, x is to the left of z.

Now, let's consider the y-coordinate (vertical position):
- x and y have some vertical overlap (x W y). This means x can be at the same level as y, or partially above or below.
- y is below z (y SW z).

Given these, there are a few possibilities for the relation between x and z:
1. If x is at the same level as y, then x would be W of z.
2. If x is below y, then x would be SW of z.
3. If x is above y, then x would be NW of z.
4. There's also a special case where x might have vertical overlap with z, making x W of z.

The actual relation depends on the specific vertical positions of the regions.

I think the answer should include NW, W, and SW as possible relations between x and z.

Wait, I need to re-check my interpretation of the W relation:

W relation: If a W b, then supx(a) <= infx(b), and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

Let me double check this: a W b means
- supx(a) <= infx(b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a)
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

Verbally:
- a is to the left of b.
- The bottom of b is lower than or equal to the bottom of a.
- The top of a is lower than or equal to the top of b.

So the y-projection of a is contained within the y-projection of b. Meaning, vertically, a is at the same level as b or can be contained within the vertical extent of b.

With this understanding:
- x W y means x is to the left of y and the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y.
- y SW z means y is to the bottom-left of z.

From x W y, we know that the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y. And from y SW z, we know that the y-projection of y is below the y-projection of z.

The relationship between the y-projection of x and the y-projection of z is determined by how the y-projection of y relates to both.

Since the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y, and the y-projection of y is entirely below the y-projection of z, the y-projection of x is also entirely below the y-projection of z.

With x to the left of z and the y-projection of x entirely below the y-projection of z, the relation between x and z is SW.

But I think I need to check this step more carefully.

Let the endpoints of the y-projection of a region r be denoted by infy(r) and supy(r).

From x W y, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (bottom of y lower than or equal to bottom of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (top of x lower than or equal to top of y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (top of y lower than or equal to bottom of z)

Combining these:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- So, supy(x) <= infy(z)

This means the top of x is lower than the bottom of z, which indicates x is below z. Combined with the fact that x is to the left of z, the relation is x SW z.

Actually, let me re-examine all the relations, and let's consider a different approach.

Let's place regions y and z first:
- y is SW of z.

Now, where can region x be, knowing that x is W of y?
- x is to the left of y.
- The y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y.

Given this, and knowing that y is SW of z, we can check where x is in relation to z.

Since y is below z, and the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y, x must also be below z. This limits the possible relations to S, SE, and SW.

But since x is to the left of y, and y is to the left of z, x is also to the left of z. The only relation that satisfies these two conditions is SW, meaning x is to the southwest of z.

But why aren't other relations possible? Let's check again.
- x is to the left of z, so the possible relations are W, NW, and SW.
- x is below z, so the possible relations are S, SE, and SW.

The only relation that satisfies both conditions is SW. So, I conclude that the relation between x and z is x SW z.

Actually, maybe I'm using a different definition of "W" than the problem is. Let me read the definition in the problem statement:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

OK so this means:
- a is to the left of b (supx(a) <= infx(b)).
- The bottom of a is above or at the same level as the bottom of b (infy(b) <= infy(a)).
- The top of a is below or at the same level as the top of b (supy(a) <= supy(b)).

Which means the y-projection of a has some overlap with the y-projection of b, but the vertical extent of a doesn't exceed the vertical extent of b.

Now, let's use this understanding:
- x W y means the y-projection of x and the y-projection of y have some overlap.
- y SW z means the y-projection of y is below the y-projection of z.

Given the overlap between the y-projections of x and y, and that y is below z, the y-projection of x can have different relations with the y-projection of z. It could be entirely below z, partially overlapping with z, or even entirely above z.

This means the relation between x and z could be:
- SW: If the y-projection of x is entirely below the y-projection of z.
- W: If the y-projection of x partially overlaps with the y-projection of z.
- NW: If the y-projection of x is entirely above the y-projection of z.

Could x SW z be possible?

From x W y:
- The bottom of x is above or at the same level as the bottom of y: infy(y) <= infy(x).
- The top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y: supy(x) <= supy(y).

From y SW z:
- y is to the left of z: supx(y) <= infx(z).
- The top of y is below the bottom of z: supy(y) <= infy(z).

Combining these:
- x is to the left of z (since x is to the left of y and y is to the left of z).
- The top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y, and the top of y is below the bottom of z.
  So, supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z.
  
This makes the relation x SW z.

Could x W z be possible?

For x W z, we need:
- x is to the left of z (which is satisfied).
- The bottom of x is above or at the same level as the bottom of z: infy(z) <= infy(x).
- The top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z: supy(x) <= supy(z).

We don't have direct information about infy(z), but we do know the top of y is below the bottom of z (supy(y) <= infy(z)). 

However, this doesn't give us a definitive comparison between the bottom of x and the bottom of z.

Let's try an example: Imagine y has the coordinates (1,1) to (2,2), z has the coordinates (3,3) to (4,4), and x has the coordinates (0,1.5) to (0.5,2.5). In this case, x W y and y SW z, but x W z. So it's not possible to determine conclusively without more specific information about the coordinates of the regions.

Actually, with the definition of W provided:
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

This means a is entirely to the left of b, and there's a constraint on the y-projections such that the y-projection of a can't extend beyond the y-projection of b in either direction.

Let's think more about the example I constructed earlier.

For x W y, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): The right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of y. (0.5 <= 1, which is true).
- infy(y) <= infy(x): The bottom of y is lower than or equal to the bottom of x. (1 <= 1.5, which is true).
- supy(x) <= supy(y): The top of x is lower than or equal to the top of y. (2.5 <= 2, which is false).

So my example is wrong because the top of x (2.5) is higher than the top of y (2), which violates the condition supy(x) <= supy(y) for x W y. Let me adjust the example.

New example:
- y has the coordinates (1,1) to (2,2).
- z has the coordinates (3,3) to (4,4).
- x has the coordinates (0,1.2) to (0.5,1.8).

For x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): 0.5 <= 1 (true).
- infy(y) <= infy(x): 1 <= 1.2 (true).
- supy(x) <= supy(y): 1.8 <= 2 (true).

For y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): 2 <= 3 (true).
- supy(y) <= infy(z): 2 <= 3 (true).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z.

Huh, looking at this example, x is still SW of z. The x-projection is to the left, and the y-projection is below.

Let me try to see if I can construct an example where x W z or x NW z.

Actually, let me take a step back and check the conditions more systematically to see if x W z or x NW z is possible.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This is true since supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).
- infy(z) <= infy(x): We know infy(y) <= infy(x) from x W y. But to establish the relation between infy(z) and infy(x), we need additional information. From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z), but we don't have information directly comparing infy(z) and infy(x).
  Can we derive a relationship using the given constraints? We have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), but these don't give us a direct comparison between infy(z) and infy(x).
- supy(x) <= supy(z): We know supy(x) <= supy(y) from x W y. And if the y-projection of z is above the y-projection of y (which is the case for y SW z), then it's reasonable that supy(x) <= supy(z). This is true given the constraints.

Without a direct relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), we can't definitively say if x W z is possible. But let's check if there's an indirect relation or restriction:

From the constraints we have:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y).
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z).

If we also know that infy(y) = infy(x) and supy(y) = supy(x), then yes, it's not possible for x W z because supy(x) = supy(y) <= infy(z), so the y-projections of x and z don't overlap. But in the general case, we have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y), which doesn't restrict the comparison between infy(z) and infy(x).

For the sake of the argument, let's say infy(z) <= infy(x). Then we have the combination of infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z). This is a very restrictive case and generally might not hold. So, generally, x W z is not possible.

What about x NW z? For this, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This is true, as established above.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): We know infy(y) <= infy(x) from x W y. But to compare infy(x) with supy(z), we need more information. If supy(z) <= infy(y), then supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), making this condition true. But we don't have information directly comparing supy(z) and infy(y).

Again, let's see if there's an indirect relation or restriction:

From the constraints we have:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y).
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z).

But these don't give us a direct comparison between supy(z) and infy(x). We can't infer anything about the position of the top of z in relation to the bottom of x.

It seems like both x W z and x NW z might be possible depending on the specifics of the regions. But I'm not sure if there's a general rule or constraint I'm missing.

Actually, let's try to construct an example for x W z and x NW z.

For x W z, the challenging part is ensuring that the y-projections of x and z overlap. Given the constraint that the y-projection of y is below the y-projection of z, and the y-projection of x is contained within or partially overlaps with the y-projection of y, it's challenging to make the y-projection of x overlap with the y-projection of z.

Actually, now I think maybe this is an issue with my understanding of the definition of SW: "a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)."

This means:
- a is to the left of b (supx(a) <= infx(b)).
- a is below b (supy(a) <= infy(b)).

But the question has y SW z, meaning the top of y is below the bottom of z. And we know that the y-projection of x has some overlap with the y-projection of y. Given these, it's challenging to have the y-projection of x overlap with the y-projection of z.

I'm thinking the relation between x and z is predominantly x SW z because:
- x is to the left of y (x W y) and y is to the left of z (y SW z), so x is to the left of z.
- The top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y (x W y) and the top of y is below the bottom of z (y SW z), so the top of x is below the bottom of z. This means x is below z.

Given these, the relation is x SW z.

But can x W z or x NW z be possible?

For x W z, we need the y-projections of x and z to overlap. But given that the y-projection of y is below the y-projection of z and the y-projection of x has some overlap with the y-projection of y, it's challenging for the y-projection of x to extend high enough to overlap with the y-projection of z.

Similarly, for x NW z, we need the y-projection of x to be above the y-projection of z. But since the y-projection of x has some overlap with the y-projection of y, and the y-projection of y is below the y-projection of z, it's challenging for the y-projection of x to be entirely above the y-projection of z.

So, I think the most consistent relation is x SW z. But let's just double-check with an example to confirm this.

Let's come up with another example:
- y has the coordinates (1,1) to (2,2).
- z has the coordinates (3,3) to (4,4).
- x has the coordinates (0,1.5) to (0.5,1.7).

For x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): 0.5 <= 1 (true).
- infy(y) <= infy(x): 1 <= 1.5 (true).
- supy(x) <= supy(y): 1.7 <= 2 (true).

For y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): 2 <= 3 (true).
- supy(y) <= infy(z): 2 <= 3 (true).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z.
- supx(x) <= infx(z): 0.5 <= 3 (true).
- supy(x) <= infy(z): 1.7 <= 3 (true).

This satisfies the definition of x SW z.

But can we find examples where x W z or x NW z?

For x W z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already true).
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (This is challenging because infy(z) = 3 and infy(x) = 1.5, so infy(z) > infy(x)).
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (This is generally true given the constraints).

So, it's challenging to construct an example where x W z because the y-projections of x and z don't seem to overlap.

For x NW z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already true).
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (This is challenging because supy(z) = 4 and infy(x) = 1.5, so supy(z) > infy(x)).

So, it's challenging to construct an example where x NW z as well.

Given these constraints, I'm leaning towards the conclusion that x SW z is the most consistent relation between x and z given the conditions.

OK, maybe I'm overthinking, the definition of the relations is clear:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b),

a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b),

I suppose I should double-check the definition of the NW relation:
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

With these definitions, let's re-examine the problem:

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining, we can infer:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z).

These two conditions align with the definition of x SW z.

For x W z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already established).
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (Not directly inferable from the given constraints).
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (Generally true given the constraints).

For x NW z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already established).
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (Not directly inferable from the given constraints).

So the answer depends on how the y-projection of z compares to the y-projection of x. Without specific information, we can't determine definitively.

So here are the possibilities:

1. If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x W z.
2. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x NW z.
3. If neither of the above, then x SW z. This would be the case if infy(x) < infy(z) or supy(z) < supy(x).

Let's revisit our constraints:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y).
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z).

Given these, we haven't established a direct relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), nor between supy(z) and infy(x). So different scenarios are possible, leading to different relations between x and z.

In conclusion, the relation between x and z could be W, NW, or SW, depending on the specific configurations of the regions.

Actually, wait...

From x W y, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (bottom of y is lower than or equal to bottom of x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (top of x is lower than or equal to top of y).

From y SW z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (top of y is below bottom of z).

Combining the last two conditions:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- Hence, supy(x) <= infy(z)

This means the top of x is below the bottom of z, which means x is below z. Combined with the fact that x is to the left of z, this means x is southwest of z.

So, the relation between x and z is x SW z.

Let me double-check if x W z or x NW z can be possible:

For x W z, we need:
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- But we know supy(x) <= infy(z) from the derivation above.
- For both infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true simultaneously, we'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z).
- This is a very specific case where the bottom of x is exactly the same as the bottom of z, and the top of x is also exactly the same as the bottom of z. This means x is essentially a flat line at the bottom of z, which is a degenerate case and not a general relation.

For x NW z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- But we know infy(y) <= infy(x) from x W y, and supy(y) <= infy(z) from y SW z.
- There's no direct relation between supy(z) and infy(x) from these. But if we're considering a general case, the y-projection of z is situated above the y-projection of y, and the y-projection of x has some overlap with the y-projection of y. It's not impossible for the bottom of x to be higher than the top of z, but this would require the bottom of x to be much higher than the top of y, which isn't a general case.

Given these considerations, I believe the most general relation between x and z is x SW z.

Wait, but I need to rethink the problem. The question is asking for the possible relations.

From the constraints we have:
- x is to the left of z.
- The y-projection of z is above the y-projection of y.
- The y-projection of x has some overlap with the y-projection of y.

Now, considering the relation between the y-projections of x and z:
- The top of x is below the bottom of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)).
- But the relationship between the bottom of x and the y-projection of z is not fixed. The bottom of x could be below, at the same level, or above the bottom of z.
- Similarly, the relationship between the top of x and the top of z is not fixed.

Given these, let's list the possible relations between x and z:

Case 1: The top of x is below the bottom of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)). So far this matches the constraint we've established.
      This means x is below z, and since x is to the left of z, the relation is x SW z.

Case 2: The bottom of x is at the same level as the bottom of z (infy(x) = infy(z)), but the top of x is still below the top of z (supy(x) <= supy(z)).
      This would mean the y-projections of x and z have an endpoint in common, and x is to the left of z.
      Here, infy(z) = infy(x) (bottom of x is same as bottom of z).
      Also, supy(x) <= infy(z) (top of x below bottom of z). But these two produce infy(z) = infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies infy(x) = supy(x). That is, the bottom of x is the same as the top of x, which means x doesn't have height.

Case 3: The top of x is at the same level as the bottom of z (supy(x) = infy(z)). Also, the bottom of x could be below the bottom of z (infy(x) <= infy(z)).
      This still aligns with supy(x) <= infy(z).
      Essentially, the top of x just touches the bottom of z, and x is to the left of z. This would still be x SW z.

I think, given the constraints, the relation between x and z is predominantly x SW z.

Also, I'm second-guessing myself on the x NW z case. Let's recheck. For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from the constraints).
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x).

For this to be true, we'd need the y-projection of z to be completely below the y-projection of x. But given that the y-projection of z is above the y-projection of y (y SW z), and the y-projection of x has some overlap with the y-projection of y (x W y), it's challenging to place x in such a way that it's completely above z.

But actually, wait. The constraint is that the y-projection of x has some overlap with the y-projection of y, not that the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y. So, the bottom of x could be higher than the top of y. And if the bottom of x is higher than the top of y, which is below the bottom of z, there's no direct relation between the y-projection of x and the y-projection of z.

Actually, let me try to re-understand the condition x W y.
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (right edge of x left of left edge of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (bottom of y below or equal to bottom of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (top of x below or equal to top of y)

OK, so this means:
- x is to the left of y.
- The bottom of x is above or at the same level as the bottom of y.
- The top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y.

Wait, but this doesn't constrain the position of the top of x relative to the bottom of y, or the position of the bottom of x relative to the top of y. It's possible that the top of x is below the bottom of y, or the bottom of x is above the top of y. That is, it's possible for the y-projections to not overlap. This is not what I understood earlier.

For the W relation, the y-projection of x must have some overlap with the y-projection of y. This means the top of x can't be below the bottom of y (supy(x) > infy(y)), and the bottom of x can't be above the top of y (infy(x) < supy(y)). Together, this means infy(x) < supy(y) and infy(y) < supy(x).

Combined with the constraints:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (bottom of y lower than or equal to bottom of x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (top of x lower than or equal to top of y).

We get:
infy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(y) and infy(y) < supy(x) <= supy(y). 

This means the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y, the top of x is at or below the top of y, and there's a region of overlap in the y-projections.

Actually, let me get back to the x W y definition provided in the problem:
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b),

This definition also requires:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (bottom of y is below or at the same level as the bottom of x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y).

Thus, essentially, the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y:
infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y).

And y is SW of z, so:
supy(y) <= infy(z).

Combining, we get:
infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).

OK, so with that we get that supy(x) <= infy(z), the top of x is below the bottom of z, which means there can be no overlap in the y-projections of x and z.

This restricts the relations between x and z to S, SE, and SW. But since x is to the left of z, the relation can only be x SW z.

I think now I have a clearer understanding, and the relation between x and z is x SW z.

Oh I missed the overall definition of relation. Let's check it again:

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

This definition is saying that multiple single-tile relations can be combined to form a more general relation. But given the constraints of the problem, I've established that the primary relation between x and z is x SW z. So the answer is "SW".

OK, actually, let's review the problem again. We are given:
- x W y
- y SW z

And we need to find all possible relations between x and z.

Based on the definitions and constraints, I've established that x is to the left of z and the top of x is below the bottom of z. This places x in the southwest direction of z, or x SW z.

So, the answer is "SW".

Actually, I want to double-check the above result as I think I got a bit confused with all the back and forth.

From the definitions:
- x W y means x is to the left of y, and the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of y. That is, the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y, and the top of x is at or below the top of y.
- y SW z means y is to the bottom-left of z. Specifically, the top of y is below the bottom of z, and y is to the left of z.

From these, I can infer that x is to the left of z (since x is to the left of y and y is to the left of z).

I also showed that the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y (x W y), and the top of y is below the bottom of z (y SW z). This means the top of x is below the bottom of z. So, x is below z.

With x to the left of z and x below z, the relation is x SW z.

So, the answer is "SW".

ANSWER:

The cardinal direction relations between region x and region z can be determined by analyzing the constraints.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of y is lower than or equal to bottom of x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x is lower than or equal to top of y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (top of y is below bottom of z)

Combining these conditions:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These conditions precisely satisfy the definition of SW: 
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

The only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.
