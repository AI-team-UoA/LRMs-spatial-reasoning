PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step. 

We are given that:
1. Region x is W of region y, meaning x W y
2. Region y is B of region z, meaning y B z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions of the relations W and B:

x W y if and only if:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

y B z if and only if:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's see what constraints we can derive for the relationship between x and z.

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's combine these constraints to see what we can deduce about x and z:

From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can't directly infer anything about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). It could be that supx(x) <= infx(z) or supx(x) > infx(z).

From infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).

From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we get supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

Case 1: If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is completely to the left of z. We already showed that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which means x could be W of z, or it could be NW of z if also supy(z) <= infy(x), or it could be SW of z if also supy(x) <= infy(z).

Case 2: If supx(x) > infx(z), then x and z overlap in the x direction. Since we already showed that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), x could be B of z if also supx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(x) >= infx(z).

Actually, the constraints we have so far are not complete, since the constraints about supx and infx are not fully determined.

Let's re-analyze the situation.

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now let's analyze more carefully. Since supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), the x-coordinate of region x is definitely bounded from above by infx(y), and the x-coordinate of region z is bounded from below by infx(z). But since infx(z) <= infx(y), we get supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which means supx(x) and infx(z) can have any relation, i.e., supx(x) <= infx(z) or supx(x) > infx(z).

Let's first consider the case where supx(x) <= infx(z), i.e., region x is completely to the left of region z. In this case, the relation between x and z depends on their relative positions in the y-axis.

We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). So, region x is somewhere in the middle of region z in terms of y-coordinate.

So, if supx(x) <= infx(z), the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Now, let's consider the case where supx(x) > infx(z). In this case, regions x and z overlap in the x-axis. We need to further analyze the constraints to determine the possible relations.

We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). So, the y-coordinate of region x is definitely bounded from below by infy(z) and from above by supy(z). 

Also, since y B z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z). And from x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y). But we don't have a constraint on the relation between infx(x) and infx(z).

Hmm, let me think. We have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z).

So, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't know the relation between supx(x) and infx(z). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is completely to the left of z in terms of x-coordinate. In this case, the possible relations between x and z would be W, NW, and SW, depending on the y-coordinate.

Actually, let's approach this differently. Let's draw out the conditions we have:

- West (W) means that one region is completely to the left of the other region, and their y-coordinates overlap.
- Bounding Box (B) means that one region is completely inside the minimum bounding box of the other region.

Given x W y and y B z, let's visualize the potential placements:

Since x W y, region x is completely to the left of region y.
Since y B z, region y is completely inside the minimum bounding box of z. This means z's bounding box extends at least as far as y's in all four directions (left, right, up, down).

If z's bounding box extends farther left than y's, then it's possible for x to overlap with z along the x-axis. But even in this case, since x is completely to the left of y and y is inside z's bounding box, x can't extend farther right than z. So, x is either completely to the left of z or overlaps with z only on the left edge of z.

Actually, let's go back to the constraints.

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's analyze these constraints with respect to the W relation between x and z.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We already know that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
We also know that supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).

But we need to check if supx(x) <= infx(z). We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). So, supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which means supx(x) and infx(z) could have any relation. They could be supx(x) <= infx(z) or supx(x) > infx(z).

If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x W z is a possible relation.

Let's check for SW. For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). So, it's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z), but not guaranteed.
We also have supy(x) <= supy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). These don't give us a clear relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It could be supy(x) <= infy(z) or supy(x) > infy(z).

So, x SW z is a possible relation.

Let's check for NW. For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). So, it's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z), but not guaranteed.
We have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). From these, we can't infer a clear relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

So, x NW z is a possible relation.

Let's check for B. For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We have infx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't know the relationship between infx(x) and infx(y).
We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), from which we can't derive a clear relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).
We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
We have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).

So, we don't have enough constraints to rule out x B z.

Let's check for N. For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). From these, we can't infer the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).
We have infx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't know the relationship between infx(x) and infx(y).
We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), from which we can't derive the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

So, we don't have enough constraints to rule out x N z.

Let's check for NE. For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), and supx(x) <= infx(y). From these, we get supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which means supx(x) <= supx(z). But this doesn't tell us about the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).
We have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). From these, we can't infer the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

So, we don't have enough constraints to rule out x NE z.

Let's check for E. For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), and supx(x) <= infx(y). From these, we don't have a clear relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).
We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
We have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).

So, we don't have enough constraints to rule out x E z.

Let's check for SE. For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), and supx(x) <= infx(y). From these, we don't have a clear relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).
We have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= supy(y). From these, we can't infer the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

So, we don't have enough constraints to rule out x SE z.

Let's check for S. For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= supy(y). From these, we can't infer the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
We have infx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't know the relationship between infx(x) and infx(y).
We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), from which we can't derive the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

So, we don't have enough constraints to rule out x S z.

Actually, I think I was being too uncertain. Let's re-analyze the constraints systematically.

From x W y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y B z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's infer what we can about the relation between x and z.

y is bounded by z, which means z is "larger" than y in terms of bounding box. And x is to the west (left) of y. Let's analyze the constraints for each direction relation to see if it's possible for x and z.

For W, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).
For supx(x) <= infx(z), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but these don't directly tell us about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). 

However, since we're considering regions, there's a reason to think it's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z). The relation x W y means x is entirely to the left of y, and y B z means z's bounding box contains y. But z doesn't have to extend to the left of y. It could be that infx(z) = infx(y), in which case supx(x) <= infx(z). But it could also be that infx(z) < infx(y), in which case we're not sure about the relation between supx(x) and infx(z).

Ok, I'm going to reason through this differently now. Let's draw out the possible regions and then see what cardinal directions are possible.

We're told that x W y, meaning x is to the west of y. We also know that y B z, meaning y is inside the bounding box of z.

First, let's consider the x-axis. From x W y, we know that x is completely to the left of y, or supx(x) <= infx(y). From y B z, we know that y is inside the bounding box of z, meaning infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Let's consider two scenarios:

1. infx(z) = infx(y): In this case, the left edge of z and y align. Since supx(x) <= infx(y) = infx(z), we know that x is completely to the left of z. Given what we'll show below about the y-axis, we can have the relations W, NW, and SW.

2. infx(z) < infx(y): In this case, z extends further left than y. Now, we need to compare supx(x) and infx(z) to determine if x is completely to the left of z. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is completely to the left of z (W, NW, or SW). If supx(x) > infx(z), then x and z overlap along the x-axis.

Now, let's consider the y-axis. From x W y, we know that infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). From y B z, we know that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From these, we derive infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). This means the bottom of z is lower than or equal to the bottom of x, and the top of x is lower than or equal to the top of z.

Given these constraints, let's check if the relation x N z is possible. For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But our constraints tell us infy(x) >= infy(y) >= infy(z) and supy(z) >= supy(y) >= supy(x). These constraints don't force supy(z) <= infy(x). In fact, if supy(y) = infy(x), then supy(z) >= infy(x), which would rule out the N relation.

Let's systematically check all possible relations between x and z:

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
We have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z) is satisfied.
For supx(x) <= infx(z), it's possible if infx(z) is large enough. This is possible if infx(z) = infx(y) or if infx(z) is close enough to infx(y).

So, x W z is a possible relation.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We have supy(y) <= supy(z) and infy(y) <= infy(x). These don't force supy(z) <= infy(x), but it's possible if supy(z) is small enough or infy(x) is large enough.
For supx(x) <= infx(z), it's possible if infx(z) is large enough.

So, x NW z is a possible relation.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We already discussed that supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
For infx(z) <= infx(x), we know infx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between infx(x) and infx(y) or infx(z). It's possible that infx(z) <= infx(x).
For supx(x) <= supx(z), we know supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). So supx(x) <= supx(z) is satisfied.

So, x N z is a possible relation.

Let me continue to go through all the relations, and I'll analyze what's possible based on the constraints.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We have supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= infx(y). These constraints don't force supx(z) <= infx(x). In fact, if infx(y) <= supx(z), then supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(z), which would mean supx(x) <= supx(z). But for the NE relation, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), which would mean supx(x) > supx(z). This is a contradiction.

So, x NE z is not a possible relation.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

As we just showed for the NE relation, the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) would lead to a contradiction.

So, x E z is not a possible relation.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Again, the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) would lead to a contradiction.

So, x SE z is not a possible relation.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We have supy(x) <= supy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). These don't force supy(x) <= infy(z).
For infx(z) <= infx(x), it's possible.
For supx(x) <= supx(z), it's satisfied as shown earlier.

So, x S z is a possible relation.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've already shown that supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible.
For supy(x) <= infy(z), it's possible if supy(x) is small enough or infy(z) is large enough.

So, x SW z is a possible relation.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We have infx(z) <= infx(y), but the relationship between infx(x) and infx(y) is not constrained. So, infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
We have supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z) is satisfied.
We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
We have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z) is satisfied.

So, x B z is a possible relation, provided that infx(z) <= infx(x).

Actually, I'm making an error here. 

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)

This means region x is completely to the left of region y. 

And from y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

If I draw this out, region z's bounding box contains region y, and region x is to the left of region y. The leftmost extent of y is at infx(y), and the leftmost extent of z is at infx(z), with infx(z) <= infx(y). 

Now, for the relation x NE z to be true, region x would have to be to the northeast of region z. This means region x would have to be both to the right and above region z. But since x is to the west (left) of y, and y is inside the bounding box of z, it's impossible for x to be to the right of z.

Similarly, for x E z and x SE z, region x would have to be to the right of region z, which is impossible given the constraints.

So the constraints rule out the relations NE, E, and SE.

Now, let's consider if x can be to the north of z (x N z).

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

These don't force supy(z) <= infy(x). In fact, if supy(y) = infy(x), then supy(y) <= supy(z) implies infy(x) <= supy(z), which would mean the N relation cannot hold. But I'm not sure if we can rule out the possibility entirely.

Let me draw out a specific scenario to check:

I'm drawing a region z whose bounding box is the entire plane. Inside the bounding box of z, there's a region y. To the west of y, there's a region x, and x is positioned so that it's above the bounding box of z (i.e., infy(x) >= supy(z)).

In this scenario, y B z and x W y are both true. But is x N z?

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The first condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), is satisfied by our construction.
For the second condition, infx(z) <= infx(x), is it guaranteed? Given y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y). But the relationship between infx(x) and infx(y) is not constrained by x W y. x could start at any x-coordinate as long as it ends before y starts. So, it's possible that infx(x) < infx(z), which would violate the second condition for x N z.

Wait, let's think of a simple example to check. Imagine z's bounding box is the entire first quadrant of the Cartesian plane, so infx(z) = 0. Then, y could be the unit square with bottom-left corner at (1, 1), so infx(y) = 1. And x could be a unit square with bottom-left corner at (0, 2), so infx(x) = 0.

In this scenario:
- y B z because (1, 1) is inside the first quadrant.
- x W y because supx(x) = 1 = infx(y), infy(y) = 1 <= 2 = infy(x), and supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 2, wait, that's not right, supy(x) would be 3, and supy(y) would be 2, and 3 not <= 2. Hmm, this doesn't work.

Ok, let's try another example. Let's make y the unit square with bottom-left corner at (2, 2), and x the unit square with bottom-left corner at (0, 1). z remains the first quadrant.

In this scenario:
- y B z because (2, 2) is inside the first quadrant.
- x W y because supx(x) = 1 < 2 = infx(y), infy(y) = 2 > 1 = infy(x), and supy(x) = 2 < 3 = supy(y).

Wait, I'm making a mistake with the definition of W. For x W y, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of y is lower than or equal to the bottom of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is lower than or equal to the top of y)

Now, let's try again with y the unit square with bottom-left corner at (2, 1), and x the unit square with bottom-left corner at (0, 2).

In this scenario:
- y B z because (2, 1) is inside the first quadrant.
- x W y because supx(x) = 1 < 2 = infx(y), infy(y) = 1 < 2 = infy(x), and supy(x) = 3 > 2 = supy(y). Wait, the last condition is not satisfied.

Let's try once more. Let y be the unit square with bottom-left corner at (2, 1), and x the unit square with bottom-left corner at (0, 1).

In this scenario:
- y B z because (2, 1) is inside the first quadrant.
- x W y because supx(x) = 1 < 2 = infx(y), infy(y) = 1 = infy(x), and supy(x) = 2 = supy(y).

Now, is x N z?
- supy(z) is effectively infinity for the first quadrant, so supy(z) > infy(x) = 1. This violates the first condition for x N z.

So it's actually not possible to have x N z. The reason for this is that z's top boundary is at least as high as or higher than y's (since y B z). And since x W y, x's top boundary is at most as high as y's. This means x's top boundary is definitely below z's top boundary, which rules out the possibility of x being entirely to the north of z.

Actually, I'm mixing up the definitions. Let me review the definitions again.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of z is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z)

And, for clarity, I'll review the other definitions as well.

For x W y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of y is lower than or equal to the bottom of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is lower than or equal to the top of y)

For y B z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left edge of z is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right edge of y is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (the bottom of z is lower than or equal to the bottom of y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (the top of y is lower than or equal to the top of z)

Now, let's consider if x N z is possible.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

We don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x), so the first condition for x N z might be satisfied.

However, for the second condition, infx(z) <= infx(x), we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)

These don't directly tell us about the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x). It's possible that infx(z) <= infx(x).

For the third condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infx(y) <= supx(y) (this is a natural constraint)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

Combining these, we get supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z) is satisfied.

So, to determine if x N z is possible, we need to check if there's a configuration where:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- All the other constrains (x W y and y B z) are satisfied.

Ok, let's go back to our one example. With z as the first quadrant, y as the unit square with bottom-left corner at (2, 1), and x as the unit square with bottom-left corner at (0, 1).

In this scenario:
- y B z because infx(z) = 0 <= 2 = infx(y), supx(y) = 3 <= infinity = supx(z), infy(z) = 0 <= 1 = infy(y), and supy(y) = 2 <= infinity = supy(z).
- x W y because supx(x) = 1 < 2 = infx(y), infy(y) = 1 = infy(x), and supy(x) = 2 = supy(y).

Is x N z?
For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

In our scenario:
- supy(z) is effectively infinity, so supy(z) > infy(x) = 1. This violates the first condition for x N z.
- infx(z) = 0 = infx(x), so the second condition is satisfied.
- supx(x) = 1 < infinity = supx(z), so the third condition is satisfied.

Since the first condition is violated, x N z is not true in this scenario.

Hmm, actually I keep making errors. Let me now try a new approach. I'll place the regions one by one and check if there's a configuration where x N z is possible.

First, let's consider z. Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, let's place z at the origin, with its center at (0, 0) and its boundary at the unit circle.

Now, for y to satisfy y B z, y must be completely within the bounding box of z. The bounding box of z is the square with corners at (-1, -1), (1, -1), (1, 1), and (-1, 1). So, y can be anywhere inside this square. For simplicity, let's place y as a smaller circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 0.5.

Finally, for x to satisfy x W y, it must be completely to the left of y. The leftmost point of y is at (-0.5, 0). So, x must be such that its rightmost point is to the left of -0.5. Let's place x as a circle with its center at (-1, 0) and radius 0.25. With this, the rightmost point of x is at (-0.75, 0), which is indeed to the left of -0.5.

Now, let's check if x N z is true:
- supy(z) = 1
- infy(x) = -0.25

Clearly, supy(z) > infy(x), which violates the first condition for x N z (we need supy(z) <= infy(x)). But wait, I need to be careful with the y-coordinates here. I think I'm mixing up the y-axis. Let's use the standard orientation of y-axis going upward and try once more.

For y to satisfy y B z, y must be completely within the bounding box of z. The bounding box of z is the square with corners at (-1, -1), (1, -1), (1, 1), and (-1, 1). So, y can be anywhere inside this square. For simplicity, let's place y as a smaller circle with its center at (0, 0) and radius 0.5.

For x to satisfy x W y, it must be completely to the left of y. The leftmost point of y is at (-0.5, 0). So, x must be such that its rightmost point is to the left of -0.5. But we also need to ensure that infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).

The bottom of y is at -0.5, so infy(y) = -0.5. To satisfy infy(y) <= infy(x), we need infy(x) to be at or above -0.5. At the same time, the top of y is at 0.5, so supy(y) = 0.5. To satisfy supy(x) <= supy(y), we need supy(x) to be at or below 0.5.

Let's place x as a circle with its center at (-1, 0) and radius 0.25. With this, the rightmost point of x is at (-0.75, 0), which is to the left of -0.5. The bottom of x is at -0.25, which is above -0.5, so infy(y) <= infy(x) is satisfied. The top of x is at 0.25, which is below 0.5, so supy(x) <= supy(y) is satisfied. This works.

Now, let's check if x N z is true:
- supy(z) = 1
- infy(x) = -0.25

Clearly, supy(z) > infy(x), which violates the first condition for x N z (we need supy(z) <= infy(x)). So, x N z is not true in this configuration. Hmm, I see the issue now. I need to move x upward to satisfy the N direction. But I also need to ensure x W y remains true.

Actually, I keep getting confused by the geometry. Let me reason this through step by step again. For region x to be N of region z, region x needs to be entirely above region z.

Actually you know what? Let me just enumerate the conditions and check if they're consistent with the conditions of x W y and y B z.

For x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of y is lower than or equal to the bottom of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is lower than or equal to the top of y)

For y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the left edge of z is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the right edge of y is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (the bottom of z is lower than or equal to the bottom of y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (the top of y is lower than or equal to the top of z)

For x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below the bottom of x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of z is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z)

From x W y and y B z, we get:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

So, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which is infy(z) <= infy(x).

We also get:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

So, supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which is supy(x) <= supy(z).

For the first condition of x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But we've just shown that infy(x) >= infy(y) >= infy(z) and supy(z) >= supy(y) >= supy(x). These don't give us a clear relation between supy(z) and infy(x). It could be supy(z) <= infy(x) or supy(z) > infy(x).

For the second condition of x N z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x). We know infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z) and supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y). But we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x).

For the third condition of x N z, we need supx(x) <= supx(z). We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z). So, supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which gives us supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, the third condition for x N z is satisfied, but the first and second conditions might or might not be satisfied depending on the specific configurations of x, y, and z.

But let's have a closer look at the first condition. For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(z) >= supy(y) (from y B z) and infy(x) >= infy(y) (from x W y). But we also know supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y). If supy(x) <= supy(y), then infy(x) <= supy(x) (this is a natural constraint, the bottom of a region is at a lower y-coordinate than the top). So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which gives us infy(x) <= supy(z). But for x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), which is the opposite. So, the first condition for x N z can't be satisfied.

This means x N z is not possible.

Let's now make a table which conditions for each cardinal relation are satisfied, and which are not, given the constraints from x W y and y B z.

For x W z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
  - We have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z). Directly this doesn't compel anything, so satisfied or not based on exact positions.
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
  - We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
- supy(x) <= supy(z)
  - We have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z) is satisfied.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
  - Same as for W, so satisfied or not based on exact positions.
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
  - Given infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), we have infy(x) <= supy(z), which is the opposite of what's needed for NW. So, not satisfied.

For x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
  - Not satisfied, as just noted.
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
  - Given constraints, this can be satisfied or not based on exact positions.
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - We have supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z) is satisfied.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
  - Given infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), we have infx(x) <= supx(z), which is the opposite of what's needed for NE. So, not satisfied.
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
  - Not satisfied, as noted for N.

For x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
  - Not satisfied, as noted for NE.
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
  - We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
- supy(x) <= supy(z)
  - We have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z) is satisfied.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
  - Not satisfied, as noted for NE.
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - Given constraints, this can be satisfied or not based on exact positions.

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - Given constraints, this can be satisfied or not based on exact positions.
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
  - Given constraints, this can be satisfied or not based on exact positions.
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - We have supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z) is satisfied.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
  - Same as for W, so satisfied or not based on exact positions.
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - Given constraints, this can be satisfied or not based on exact positions.

For x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
  - Given constraints, this can be satisfied or not based on exact positions.
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - We have supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z) is satisfied.
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
  - We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
- supy(x) <= supy(z)
  - We have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z) is satisfied.

So, based on my analysis so far, here's a classification of the possible relations between x and z:

Definitely not possible:
- x N z (because we need supy(z) <= infy(x), but infy(x) <= supy(z) is inferred)
- x NW z (for the same reason)
- x NE z (because we need supx(z) <= infx(x), but infx(x) <= supx(z) is inferred)
- x E z (for the same reason)
- x SE z (for the same reason)

Possibly true depending on specific positions:
- x W z
- x SW z
- x S z
- x B z

But I'm actually not fully confident in this. Let me think through once again.

Actually, I'm going to go through and re-derive the relations, just to double-check my own logic.

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can infer:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z).

Constraints on NW relation which are not satisfied:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (not satisfied because infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z))

Constraints on N relation which are not satisfied:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (not satisfied, as above)

Constraints on NE relation which are not satisfied:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (not satisfied, as above)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (not satisfied because infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z))

Constraints on E relation which are not satisfied:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (not satisfied, as above)

Constraints on SE relation which are not satisfied:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (not satisfied, as above)

So, the constraints x W y and y B z exclude the relations NW, N, NE, E, and SE from being possible between x and z. 

So we're left with these as potentially possible: W, SW, S, and B. Let's check if there's anything further which can be excluded.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The latter three constraints are always satisfied as proven above. The first one, infx(z) <= infx(x), can be satisfied or violated depending on the specific positions of x, y, and z. So, x B z is a possible relation.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The third constraint is always satisfied. The first and second constraints can be satisfied or violated depending on the specific positions of x, y, and z. So, x S z is a possible relation.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Both constraints can be satisfied or violated depending on the specific positions of x, y, and z. So, x SW z is a possible relation.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The latter two constraints are always satisfied. The first one, supx(x) <= infx(z), can be satisfied or violated depending on the specific positions of x, y, and z. So, x W z is a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given the constraints x W y and y B z, are:
- x W z
- x SW z
- x S z
- x B z

So my answer is: W, SW, S, B.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z could be: W, SW, S, B

Let me explain why:

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, we can derive:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

The N, NW, NE, E, and SE relations are impossible because:
- For N, NW, NE: We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but our constraints give us infy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- For E, SE: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but our constraints give us infx(x) ≤ supx(z)

This leaves W, SW, S, and B as the only possible relations.
