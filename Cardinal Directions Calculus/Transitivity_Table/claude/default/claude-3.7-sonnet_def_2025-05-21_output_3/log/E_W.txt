PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Alright, let's think through this problem step by step.

We know that:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is W of region z

To figure out the possible relations between region x and region z, I'll use the definitions of the cardinal directions and reason about the constraints.

First, let's recall the definitions:
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

From "x is E of y", we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y is W of z", we have:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z)
5. infy(z) <= infy(y)
6. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's try to derive constraints on the relation between x and z:

From 1 and 4, we get:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
This doesn't directly tell us anything about the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z).

From 2 and 5, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
So, infy(z) <= infy(x).

From 3 and 6, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
So, supy(x) <= supy(z).

From the constraints infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), we know that the y-projections of regions x and z overlap in a specific way (or z's y-projection contains x's y-projection). But we don't have much information about the x-projections.

Let's think about this differently. If x is E of y and y is W of z, where could x be in relation to z? Let's visualize the constraints:

- If supx(y) <= infx(x), it means x is to the right of y.
- If supx(y) <= infx(z), it means z is to the right of y.

So both x and z are to the right of y. However, we don't know which is more to the right between x and z.

Furthermore, from infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), we know that in terms of the y-coordinate, z "encloses" x.

Now, let's consider the possible cardinal directions from x to z:

1. E: This means x is to the right of z. Is this possible? Yes, if infx(x) >= supx(z).
2. W: This means x is to the left of z. Is this possible? Yes, if supx(x) <= infx(z).
3. N: This means x is above z. Is this possible? No, because we derived supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the definition of N.
4. S: This means x is below z. Is this possible? No, because we derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the definition of S.
5. NE: This means x is to the right and above z. Is this possible? No, for the same reason as N.
6. SE: This means x is to the right and below z. Is this possible? No, for the same reason as S.
7. NW: This means x is to the left and above z. Is this possible? No, for the same reason as N.
8. SW: This means x is to the left and below z. Is this possible? No, for the same reason as S.
9. B: This means x is inside the bounding box of z. Is this possible? Yes, if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Wait, I think I've made a mistake. Let me be more precise in my reasoning.

From "x is E of y", we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y is W of z", we have:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z)
5. infy(z) <= infy(y)
6. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's see what this tells us about the relation between x and z:

From 1 and 4, we get:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z).

From 2 and 5, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
So, infy(z) <= infy(x).

From 3 and 6, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
So, supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now, let's consider all possible cardinal directions from x to z:

1. E: x is E of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We already have the latter two conditions from our deductions. The first condition is possible, but not guaranteed by the given constraints.

2. W: x is W of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We already have the latter two conditions from our deductions. The first condition is possible, but not guaranteed by the given constraints. Note that if this holds, it contradicts the possibility of E.

3. N: x is N of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we already established that supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

4. S: x is S of z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we already established that infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

5. NE: x is NE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But we already established that supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

6. SE: x is SE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we already established that infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SE of z.

7. NW: x is NW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But we already established that supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be NW of z.

8. SW: x is SW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we already established that infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

9. B: x is B of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We already have the latter two conditions from our deductions. The first two conditions are possible, but not guaranteed by the given constraints.

Actually, I realize that the constraints we've derived aren't that restrictive. Let's think more carefully about what's possible:

Looking at the x-coordinates first:
- Both x and z are to the right of y.
- x can be to the right of z, to the left of z, or they can overlap in the x-direction.

Looking at the y-coordinates:
- z's y-projection "encloses" x's y-projection in the sense that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- x and z cannot be strictly above or below each other in the y-direction.

Let me reconsider the possible cardinal directions:

1. E: x is E of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition means x is strictly to the right of z. The latter two conditions are satisfied from our deductions. So, x can be E of z.

2. W: x is W of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition means x is strictly to the left of z. The latter two conditions are satisfied from our deductions. So, x can be W of z.

Wait, I need to be careful here. Can both E and W be possible? 

Let's say that regions y, x, and z are all aligned along a horizontal line (in that order). Then x would be E of y and y would be W of z. But in this case, x would also be E of z, not W of z.

But consider a different configuration where z is far to the right and slightly down from y, and x is directly to the right of y but below both. Then x would be E of y and y would be W of z, but x might be W of z.

I realize I'm not being systematic enough. Let me try to be more precise:

Given:
- x is E of y, which means: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is W of z, which means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From these, we can derive:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

These are the only direct constraints we can derive on the relationship between x and z. These constraints tell us about the y-projections but don't give us much information about the x-projections.

So, in terms of x-coordinates, any of the following is possible:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (which would make x E of z)
2. supx(x) <= infx(z) (which would make x W of z)
3. None of the above (which suggests overlap in the x-direction).

In terms of y-coordinates, we have established that:
1. infy(z) <= infy(x)
2. supy(x) <= supy(z)

This suggests that z's y-projection encompasses or overlaps with x's y-projection.

Now, let's systematically go through all the possible cardinal directions from x to z:

1. E: For x to be E of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two conditions are already satisfied, and the first condition is one of the possible conditions for the x-projections. So, x can be E of z.

2. W: For x to be W of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two conditions are already satisfied, and the first condition is another of the possible conditions for the x-projections. So, x can be W of z.

3. N: For x to be N of z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But the first condition contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) that we derived. So, x cannot be N of z.

4. S: For x to be S of z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But the first condition contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) that we derived. So, x cannot be S of z.

5. NE: For x to be NE of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is possible, but the second condition contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) that we derived. So, x cannot be NE of z.

6. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition is possible, but the second condition contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) that we derived. So, x cannot be SE of z.

7. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is possible, but the second condition contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) that we derived. So, x cannot be NW of z.

8. SW: For x to be SW of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition is possible, but the second condition contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) that we derived. So, x cannot be SW of z.

9. B: For x to be B of z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two conditions are already satisfied, and the first two conditions are possible for the x-projections. So, x can be B of z.

But I said that any of the conditions are possible for the x-coordinates, which would include:
4. infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x) (which would mean z's x-projection is contained within x's x-projection)
5. infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (which would mean x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)
6. infx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (which would mean x's and z's x-projections overlap)
7. infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) <= supx(x) (which would also mean x's and z's x-projections overlap)

Hmm, I need to think more carefully about all possible scenarios.

I realized I've been a bit imprecise in my understanding. At this point I think it's helpful to draw all possible scenarios. 

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is W of region z

There are several possible configurations for the three regions, but the constraints we've derived remain:
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

These constraints tell us that in terms of the y-coordinates, z "encompasses" x in a way that the lowest point of x is above the lowest point of z, and the highest point of x is below the highest point of z.

For the x-coordinates, the only constraints we have from the given conditions are:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from "x is E of y")
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from "y is W of z")

These constraints don't directly give us a relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z.

Let's consider all possibilities for the relative positions of x and z:

1. x is E of z: If supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The latter two conditions are satisfied from our derivations, and the first condition is a possibility for the x-coordinates. So, x can be E of z. This can happen if both x and z are to the right of y, but x is farther to the right.

2. x is W of z: If supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The latter two conditions are satisfied from our derivations, and the first condition is another possibility for the x-coordinates. But is it compatible with the given constraints?

   If supx(x) <= infx(z), and we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (from "x is E of y"), then supx(y) <= infx(z). This is consistent with "y is W of z". So, x can be W of z.

3. Other conditions where x and z overlap in the x-direction:
   - If x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - If z's x-projection is contained within x's x-projection: infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x).
   - If x's and z's x-projections overlap in other ways.

Considering all of these cases, we can now determine the possible cardinal directions:

1. E: As determined earlier, x can be E of z.

2. W: As determined earlier, x can be W of z.

3. N, S, NE, SE, NW, SW: These are not possible due to the y-coordinate constraints we've derived.

4. B: For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two conditions are already satisfied, and the first two conditions are a possibility for the x-coordinates. So, x can be B of z.

What about other multi-tile directions? For each of the 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW), we can combine them only if the regions are adjacent and the combination makes a contiguous region.

Given the constraints, x's region can't be strictly above or below z's region due to the y-coordinate constraints. So, any combination involving N, S, NE, SE, NW, SW is not possible.

If x's region overlaps with z's region in the x-direction but is not contained within (B) or strictly to the right (E) or left (W), would it satisfy a different cardinal direction? I think it would be a combination of directions.

For instance, if infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x), then x's x-projection contains z's x-projection. Combined with infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), this gives a specific relation where z's y-projection contains x's y-projection, and x's x-projection contains z's x-projection. This can be represented as a combination of directions. But since we're asked for pure cardinal directions, I'm not sure if this falls into any of the 9 directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B).

Actually, let's go back to the definitions:

Single-tile cardinal direction relation B (bounding box), S (South), SW (South West), W (West), NW (North West), N (North), NE (North East), E (East) and SE (South East) is defined as follows:

B: a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
S: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
SW: a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
W: a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
NW: a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
N: a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
NE: a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
E: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
SE: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now, lets reconsider:

For x to be E of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). 
For x to be W of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). 
For x to be B of z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). 

Given the constraints from the problem (x is E of y and y is W of z), we've derived:
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Using these, we can easily check if the conditions for each direction are met:

E: The y-constraints are satisfied. We just need supx(z) <= infx(x). This is possible in some configurations.

W: The y-constraints are satisfied. We just need supx(x) <= infx(z). I need to check if this is possible.

   Recall that we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is E of y) and supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y is W of z). These don't directly constrain the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). So, we can have supx(x) <= infx(z) in some configurations. For example, if x is directly to the right of y but less far to the right than z is, this can happen.

B: The y-constraints are satisfied. We just need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This is possible in some configurations.

Now, let's consider some overlap conditions:

4. If infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x), then x's x-projection contains z's x-projection. Combined with infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), this means x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection, and z's x-projection is contained within x's x-projection. This doesn't match any of the 9 cardinal directions, but it seems to be a valid relative position.

5. If infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) <= supx(x), then x's and z's x-projections overlap in a specific way. This, combined with the y-constraints, also doesn't match any of the 9 cardinal directions.

6. If infx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), then x's and z's x-projections overlap in another specific way. Again, this, combined with the y-constraints, doesn't match any of the 9 cardinal directions.

Ah, I've been overlooking the fact that the cardinal direction relation seems to indicate a categorical relation. That is, relations like E, W, B, etc., are strictly single-tile cardinal directions. But based on the introduction, a cardinal direction relation can be an expression R1: ... : Rk, where 1<=k<=9.

So, if we have regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG, then the cardinal direction relation is R1: ... : Rk.

Now, for the overlap conditions I was considering, it seems they might be represented as multi-tile direction relations. Let's check:

4. If infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x), and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), this means x is to the left of z, to the right of z, and also contains parts of z in the middle. This might be represented as a combination of E, W, and some other direction.

5 & 6. These are similar overlap cases.

I wonder if we should explicitly explore x possessing a multi-tile cardinal direction?

Single-tile directions for x relative to z:
- E: Possible.
- W: Possible.
- B: Possible.
- N, S, NE, SE, NW, SW: Not possible due to y-constraints.

Let's see if x can have a multi-tile cardinal direction relation:
- E:W: No, x can't be both strictly east AND strictly west of z.
- E:B: This means x has two disjoint regions, one to the east of z and one inside the bounding box of z. This is possible.
- W:B: Similarly, this is possible.
- E:W:B: This suggests x has three disjoint regions. This seems unlikely given the constraints.

Actually, wait. The problem description says:

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: 
i) 1 <= k <= 9, 
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, 
iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, 
iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

This implies that the multi-tile direction R1: ... : Rk represents a region that can be divided into k disjoint regions, each satisfying one of the single-tile cardinal directions.

In our problem, we're asked for the relation between region x and region z. If we consider a single region x, it can stand in a single cardinal direction relation to z. But if x can be divided into multiple disjoint regions, then the relation might be a multi-tile direction.

Given the constraints from the problem (x is E of y and y is W of z), we've established that x can be E of z, W of z, or B of z, and can't be N, S, NE, SE, NW, or SW of z. I don't think we have any specific constraints that would force x to be split into multiple disjoint regions.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are E, W, and B. But since the problem asks for all possible relations, I'm still not sure if I should consider multi-tile directions like E:B, W:B, etc.

The more I think about it, the more I think the answer is indeed just E, W, or B. But let's reconsider:

If the region x is a single cohesive region, then it can't be E and W at the same time. It can be either E, W, or B of z, as we derived.

But if the region x consists of disjoint subregions, it might be possible for x to have a multi-tile direction relation to z. But the problem statement says x is E of y. This suggests that x is a single cohesive region that's to the east of y. If x were multiple disjoint regions, the statement would likely be clearer about which part of x is being referred to.

Therefore, I think the answer should be that region x can be in one of the following relations to region z: E, W, or B.

Let's reconsider one more time to make sure.

Here's another way to think about it: Given the constraints from "x is E of y" and "y is W of z", are there any configurations where x would stand in a multi-tile direction relation to z? If so, what would they be?

I don't see any inherent reason why x, as a single cohesive region, must be in a single-tile direction relative to z. For instance, if x is a large region that spans both to the east and west of z, it might have a multi-tile direction relation.

But the problem is, given our constraints, it's hard to see a scenario where x would have a multi-tile relation to z. If x is E of y and y is W of z, then both x and z are to the right of y. Depending on the exact positioning, x can be to the right of z (E), to the left of z but still to the right of y (W), or inside z (B). But it's hard to see how x, as a single region, could be in a multi-tile relation to z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are E, W, and B.

Actually, I wonder if the problem is asking about multi-tile directions in the case where I have a single object x, while allowing that a cardinal direction relation R1:...:Rk can refer to a collection of objects a1, ..., ak, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b).

But this interpretation doesn't seem to fit with "region x is E of region y" and "region y is W of region z". These statements suggest we're considering single regions in our problem.

So I believe the possible relations between region x and region z are E, W, and B.

Let me double check that a multi-tile cardinal direction can't hold with x being a single cohesive region. Suppose x is a single cohesive region. Can it be both E and B of z at the same time?

For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

The y-constraints are the same for both. But the x-constraints for E require supx(z) <= infx(x), while the x-constraints for B require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). These x-constraints conflict: supx(z) <= infx(x) means x is strictly to the right of z, while infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) mean x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection.

So, a single cohesive region x can't be both E and B of z at the same time. This suggests that multi-tile directions like E:B aren't possible for a single cohesive region.

Similarly, x can't be both W and B, or both E and W, or all three (E, W, B) at the same time.

But actually, I just realized the problem with my earlier reasoning. The multi-tile direction R1:...:Rk doesn't necessarily refer to a collection of disjoint regions a1, ..., ak. Rather, it allows for a single region to be in multiple cardinal directions relative to a reference region, if the region can be mapped to multiple Cartesian product areas of the reference region.

Let's consider this more carefully:

If x is a single cohesive region, can it be in a multi-tile direction relation to z? This would mean that x overlaps with multiple tiles around z: perhaps it's partially to the east and partially to the north. But our constraints limit the possible directions to E, W, and B, and we've just shown that a single cohesive region can't be in two of these directions at the same time.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are indeed just E, W, and B.

Actually, I realize that there's a subtlety to the question. It asks:

"If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

So it's asking for "possible relations", not "possible directions".

But I think those are the same for our purposes. I think the best answer for this problem is E, W, and B (with B being "bounded by", meaning x is inside the bounding box of z).

Actually, I figured out the issue here. When I referred to a multi-tile direction as a cardinal direction relation R1:...:Rk, I didn't fully understand the definition. It's not that a region is simultaneously in multiple cardinal directions. Instead, the region can be split into disjoint subregions, each in a single cardinal direction.

From the given constraints "x is E of y" and "y is W of z", we know that x, as a single cohesive region, can be in one of three possible cardinal directions relative to z: E, W, or B. If we were to consider x as potentially consisting of multiple disjoint regions, then we might consider other possibilities. But the problem statement suggests x, y, and z are all single cohesive regions.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are E, W, and B.

OK, let's take a step back. The problem might be way more straightforward. Let's say we are ignoring the multi-tile relations for now:

If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, I need to find the possible directions of x relative to z.

So I have three regions on the plane. The first observation is that there's no transitive closure: if x is E of y and y is W of z, it doesn't logically tell us a specific direction of x relative to z.

But I can narrow it down. If x is E of y, this means x is strictly to the right of y. And if y is W of z, this means y is strictly to the left of z. So, we have three regions in a left-to-right ordering: y, z, and x. Is that correct? Hmm, no, this is wrong. It could also be y, x, z. Since we don't have a direct constraint between x and z (we only know both are to the right of y), either can be to the right of the other.

So the order could be:
1. y, x, z (where x is to the right of y but to the left of z)
2. y, z, x (where x is to the right of both y and z)

For order 1 (y, x, z), x is likely W of z.
For order 2 (y, z, x), x is likely E of z.

But I forgot the y-coordinate. The constraints for x being E of y and y being W of z provide constraints in both the x and y dimensions. I need to think about these more carefully.

From the given constraints:
- x is E of y: This means supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is W of z: This means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From these, we derived:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

These y-constraints tell us that, in terms of the y-dimension, z "encompasses" both x and y in a way that the lowest point of x is above the lowest point of z, and the highest point of x is below the highest point of z.

In terms of the x-dimension, the only constraints we have from the given conditions are:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from "x is E of y")
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from "y is W of z")

These don't directly give us a relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z. Both x and z are to the right of y, but either can be to the right of the other, or they can overlap in the x-dimension.

Given these considerations, I'd say the possible relations between region x and region z are:
1. E: If x is to the right of z.
2. W: If x is to the left of z (but still to the right of y).
3. B: If x is inside the bounding box of z.

Ah, I see. The question is, if region x is E of region y, and region y is W of region z, what are the possible relations x can have with z. "Relation" can simply refer to cardinal direction relation.

The possible cardinals direction relations are {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

I'm given that x is E of y. This means supx(y) <= infx(x) [strictly to the right], infy(y) <= infy(x) [above or at the same level], and supy(x) <= supy(y) [below or at the same level].

I'm also given that y is W of z. This means supx(y) <= infx(z) [strictly to the left], infy(z) <= infy(y) [above or at the same level], and supy(y) <= supy(z) [below or at the same level].

From these constraints, we can derive:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, let's go through the list of possible directions again to see which ones are consistent with these constraints.

1. B: This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two conditions are already satisfied, and the first two conditions can be satisfied in some configurations. So, x can be B of z.

2. S: This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (unless supy(x) = infy(x) = infy(z), which is a boundary case). So, x generally can't be S of z.

3. SW: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (unless supy(x) = infy(x) = infy(z)). So, x generally can't be SW of z.

4. W: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). All these conditions can be satisfied in some configurations. So, x can be W of z.

5. NW: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition can be satisfied, but for the second condition, we've derived supy(x) <= supy(z), which means supy(z) can be greater than or equal to supy(x). If supy(z) > infy(x), then supy(z) <= infy(x) can't be satisfied. But if supy(z) = supy(x) and supy(x) = infy(x) (a degenerate case), it is possible. So, x generally can't be NW of z, except in specific degenerate cases.

6. N: This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The last two conditions can be satisfied, but for the first condition, we've derived supy(x) <= supy(z), which means supy(z) can be greater than or equal to supy(x). If supy(z) > infy(x), then supy(z) <= infy(x) can't be satisfied. If supy(z) = supy(x) and supy(x) = infy(x), this holds. But since we have infy(z) <= infy(x), we'd then have infy(z) <= infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z), which means region z is a horizontal line, which is not a proper region in REG. So, x can't be N of z, except in specific degenerate cases.

7. NE: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition can be satisfied, but for the second condition, we've derived supy(x) <= supy(z), which means supy(z) can be greater than or equal to supy(x). If supy(z) > infy(x), then supy(z) <= infy(x) can't be satisfied. If supy(z) = supy(x) and supy(x) = infy(x), this holds. But since we have infy(z) <= infy(x), we'd then have infy(z) <= infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z), which means region z is a horizontal line. So, x can't be NE of z, except potentially in specific degenerate cases.

8. E: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). All these conditions can be satisfied in some configurations. So, x can be E of z.

9. SE: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition can be satisfied, but the second condition contradicts the constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). So, generally x can't be SE of z, unless supy(x) = infy(x) = infy(z).

So, in general, the possible relations between region x and region z are E, W, and B.

Even though I've argued for special cases where some of the other relations might hold (in degenerate cases), I'm inclined to just report the three aforementioned relations because these are definitely possible.

Let me double check the degenerate cases. First, note that the problem refers to regions in REG, which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This means we're talking about "nice" regions without holes or unusual properties.

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition can be satisfied, but for the second condition, we've derived supy(x) <= supy(z), which constrains supy(z). For supy(z) <= infy(x) to hold, we'd need supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This would mean the height of x is zero (since supy(x) <= infy(x)), which isn't a proper region in REG. So, x can't be NW of z.

Similarly, for other relations like N, NE, S, SE, SW, I can show they're not possible for proper regions in REG.

So, the final answer is: The possible relations between region x and region z are E, W, and B.

Hmm, actually, wait. Let's be super thorough and double check all of the degenerate cases. In E, W, and B, we've shown these relations can hold, i.e. that they're consistent with the given constraints.

For S, we said x generally can't be S of z. In this relation, we need:
supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

We derived infy(z) <= infy(x). If both supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) are to hold, we'd have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the height of x is zero or negative, which doesn't correspond to a proper region in REG. So, x can't be S of z.

For SW, we said x generally can't be SW of z. In this relation, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We derived infy(z) <= infy(x). If both supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) are to hold, we'd have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the height of x is zero or negative, which doesn't correspond to a proper region in REG. So, x can't be SW of z.

For W, we said x can be W of z. In this relation, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

These conditions are consistent with our derived constraints. So, x can be W of z.

For NW, we said x generally can't be NW of z. In this relation, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

We derived supy(x) <= supy(z). If both supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are to hold, we'd have supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This means the height of x is zero or negative, which doesn't correspond to a proper region in REG. So, x can't be NW of z.

For N, we said x generally can't be N of z. In this relation, we need:
supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

We derived supy(x) <= supy(z). If both supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are to hold, we'd have supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This means the height of x is zero or negative, which doesn't correspond to a proper region in REG. So, x can't be N of z.

For NE, we said x generally can't be NE of z. In this relation, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

We derived supy(x) <= supy(z). If both supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are to hold, we'd have supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This means the height of x is zero or negative, which doesn't correspond to a proper region in REG. So, x can't be NE of z.

For E, we said x can be E of z. In this relation, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

These conditions are consistent with our derived constraints. So, x can be E of z.

For SE, we said x generally can't be SE of z. In this relation, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We derived infy(z) <= infy(x). If both supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) are to hold, we'd have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the height of x is zero or negative, which doesn't correspond to a proper region in REG. So, x can't be SE of z.

I've reconfirmed the possible cardinal direction relations: E, W, and B.

In summary: The cardinal direction relation of x with respect to z is one of the following: E, W, B.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal direction relations are possible between regions x and z, given the constraints that x is E of y and y is W of z.

From "x is E of y," I can derive:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is strictly to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of y is at or below bottom of x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x is at or below top of y)

From "y is W of z," I can derive:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is strictly to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (bottom of z is at or below bottom of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (top of y is at or below top of z)

Combining these constraints, I can derive:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (transitively through y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (transitively through y)

Now I'll check each possible cardinal direction relation between x and z:

For E: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
The y-constraints are already satisfied, and the x-constraint is possible. So E is possible.

For W: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
The y-constraints are already satisfied, and the x-constraint is possible. So W is possible.

For B: Requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
The y-constraints are already satisfied, and the x-constraints are possible. So B is possible.

For N, S, NE, SE, NW, SW: These all require constraints that contradict our derived y-constraints, making them impossible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: E, W, B
