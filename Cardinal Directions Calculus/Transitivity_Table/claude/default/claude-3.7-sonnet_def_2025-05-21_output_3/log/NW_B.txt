PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step.

Given:
1. Region x is NW of region y. This means: 
   - x is in the northwest direction of y
   - specifically: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

2. Region y is B of region z. This means:
   - y is in the bounding box of z
   - specifically: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's analyze the constraints on x relative to z through the transitive relationship with y:

For the x-coordinate:
- We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- We know infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
- This means supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(z)
- So we have supx(x) <= supx(z)

But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and infx(z), which we would need to determine the east-west component of the relation.

For the y-coordinate:
- We know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- We know supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)
- This gives us: supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z))

But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and infy(z), which we would need to determine the north-south component of the relation.

Let's think about this geometrically. 

If x is NW of y, and y is contained within the bounding box of z, then x could be:

1. NW of z - This is possible if z doesn't extend too far north or west beyond y.
2. N of z - This is possible if z extends westward beyond x.
3. W of z - This is possible if z extends northward beyond x.
4. B of z - This is possible if z is large enough to contain x.
5. NE, E, SE, S, SW - These should be impossible based on the constraints.

Let me verify these possibilities more rigorously:

1. x NW z requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
   - So we can't definitely say supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - Thus, we can't confirm that x is always NW of z

Wait, let me be more careful. If y is in the bounding box of z, then z's bounding box contains y's bounding box. This means z can extend in any direction beyond y.

Let me reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

If x is NW of y, and y is within the bounding box of z:

1. NW: x can be NW of z if z doesn't extend west or north beyond x.
2. N: x can be N of z if z extends west to include the same longitude as x.
3. W: x can be W of z if z extends north to include the same latitude as x.
4. B: x can be within z's bounding box if z extends both west and north to include x.
5. NE: This is not possible because x is west of y, and y is within z, so x must be west of some part of z.
6. E: This is not possible because x is west of y, and y is within z, so x must be west of some part of z.
7. SE: This is not possible because x is west and north of y, and y is within z, so x must be west and can't be south of all of z.
8. S: This is not possible because x is north of y, and y is within z, so x must be north of some part of z.
9. SW: This is not possible because x is north of y, and y is within z, so x must be north of some part of z.

So, if I reason correctly, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, and B.

Actually, I need to double-check this. Let's think about region z's possible positions relative to y more carefully:

Since region y is B of region z, z can be the same as y (if they have identical bounding boxes) or z can extend beyond y's bounding box in any direction.

Let's consider some specific scenarios:

Scenario 1: z is identical to y (same bounding box)
- If x is NW of y, then x is NW of z as well.

Scenario 2: z extends west of y but not north
- In this case, x might be N of z (rather than NW) if z extends far enough west to be directly below x.

Scenario 3: z extends north of y but not west
- Here, x might be W of z (rather than NW) if z extends far enough north to be directly to the right of x.

Scenario 4: z extends both north and west of y
- In this case, x might be inside the bounding box of z (B relation) if z extends far enough to contain x.

Hmm, I need to be even more careful. Let's revisit the definitions:

1. x NW y means: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
   - This places x entirely to the northwest of y's bounding box.

2. y B z means: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)
   - This means y is contained within z's bounding box.

Given these, let's determine what we can say about x's position relative to z:

From x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) => We can't directly compare supx(x) and infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z) => We can't directly compare infy(x) and supy(z)

So, the exact relation between x and z is not uniquely determined.

Let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations:

1. NW: This is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - If supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - If supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - So, NW is possible.

2. N: This is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - If infx(z) < infx(y) and extends west beyond x, then infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - If supx(z) > supx(y) and extends east beyond y, then supx(x) <= supx(z) (since x is NW of y)
   - If supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - So, N is possible.

This is getting more complex than I expected. Let me reconsider with a more intuitive approach.

Given:
- x is NW of y
- y is B of z

This means:
- x is entirely to the northwest of y
- y is entirely within the bounding box of z

Now, let's consider the possible positions of z relative to x:

1. z is entirely to the southeast of x. This would make x NW of z.
2. z extends westward to include the same longitude as x, but still south of x. This would make x N of z.
3. z extends northward to include the same latitude as x, but still east of x. This would make x W of z.
4. z extends both westward and northward to include x. This would make x B of z.
5. z extends westward beyond x. This would make x NE of z.
6. z extends northward beyond x and westward beyond x. This would make x E of z.
7. z extends northward beyond x, westward beyond x, and southward beyond y. This would make x SE of z.
8. z extends only northward beyond x and southward beyond y. This would make x E of z.
9. z extends only westward beyond x and southward beyond y. This would make x NE of z.

Wait, I need to check if all of these scenarios are actually possible given the constraints. Let's reconsider:

Given that x is NW of y, it means x is entirely to the northwest of y's bounding box. Specifically:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

Given that y is B of z, it means y is entirely within z's bounding box. Specifically:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Now, let's evaluate the possible cardinal relations between x and z:

1. NW: x is NW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - From the constraints, we can't directly ensure supx(x) <= infx(z) because infx(z) can be less than infx(y).
   - Similarly, we can't ensure supy(z) <= infy(x) because supy(z) can be greater than supy(y).
   - But it's possible for these conditions to be met if z doesn't extend too far west or north.

2. N: x is N of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - It's possible for infx(z) to be less than infx(x) if z extends far enough west.
   - It's possible for supx(x) to be less than supx(z) because supx(x) is less than infx(y), which is less than supx(y), which is less than supx(z).
   - As before, supy(z) <= infy(x) is not guaranteed but possible.

3. NE: x is NE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - This would require supx(z) <= infx(x), but from the constraints, supx(z) >= supx(y) >= infx(y) >= supx(x).
   - This contradicts the requirement, so x cannot be NE of z.

3 (4). W: x is W of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - As before, supx(x) <= infx(z) is not guaranteed but possible.
   - It's possible for infy(z) to be less than infy(x) if z extends far enough south.
   - It's possible for supy(x) to be less than supy(z) if z extends far enough north.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. We need to be more careful about the constraints.

Given that x is NW of y:
- x is entirely to the northwest of y.
- Specifically, the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y (supx(x) <= infx(y)).
- And the bottommost point of x is above the topmost point of y (supy(y) <= infy(x)).

Given that y is B of z:
- y is completely within the bounding box of z.
- Specifically, the leftmost point of y is to the right of the leftmost point of z (infx(z) <= infx(y)).
- The rightmost point of y is to the left of the rightmost point of z (supx(y) <= supx(z)).
- The bottommost point of y is above the bottommost point of z (infy(z) <= infy(y)).
- The topmost point of y is below the topmost point of z (supy(y) <= supy(z)).

Now, if we imagine a scenario where y is B of z, then z's bounding box can extend in any direction beyond y's bounding box. 

Let's determine the possible cardinal relations between x and z:

1. NW: x is NW of z if the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) and the bottommost point of x is above the topmost point of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)).
   - From x NW y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y).
   - From y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y).
   - This means we can't guarantee supx(x) <= infx(z). It depends on how far west z extends.
   - Similarly, from x NW y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - From y B z, we know supy(y) <= supy(z).
   - This means we can't guarantee supy(z) <= infy(x). It depends on how far north z extends.
   - So, x can be NW of z if z doesn't extend too far west or north.

2. N: x is N of z if the bottommost point of x is above the topmost point of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z (infx(z) <= infx(x)), and the rightmost point of x is to the left of the rightmost point of z (supx(x) <= supx(z)).
   - As before, supy(z) <= infy(x) is not guaranteed but possible.
   - It's possible for infx(z) to be less than infx(x) if z extends far enough west.
   - from x NW y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y).
   - From y B z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z).
   - This means supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - So, x can be N of z if z extends far enough west and doesn't extend too far north.

OK, let me be very systematic in evaluating all possible cardinal directions:

1. NW: x is NW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - This is possible if z doesn't extend too far west or north.

2. N: x is N of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - This is possible if z extends far enough west and doesn't extend too far north.

3. NE: x is NE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - From the constraints, supx(z) >= supx(y) >= infx(y) >= supx(x).
   - This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x), so x cannot be NE of z.

4. W: x is W of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - This is possible if z doesn't extend too far west and extends far enough north and south.

5. B: x is B of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - This is possible if z extends far enough in all directions.

6. E: x is E of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From the constraints, supx(z) >= supx(y) >= infx(y) >= supx(x).
   - This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x), so x cannot be E of z.

7. SW: x is SW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From x NW y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - From y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y).
   - This means supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
   - If we combine these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z), so x cannot be SW of z.

8. S: x is S of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - As before, supy(x) <= infy(z) is contradicted by the constraints, so x cannot be S of z.

9. SE: x is SE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - Both constraints are contradicted, so x cannot be SE of z.

Now, let's see what cardinal directions are possible: NW, N, W, B.

But wait, I want to make sure I haven't made a mistake. Let me double-check one more case:

8. NE: x is NE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - But from the constraints, it appears possible that z could be wide and extend far to the west beyond x, such that supx(z) is much larger than infx(x). 
   - Similarly, z could extend far to the north beyond x, such that supy(z) is much larger than infy(x).
   
   Let's double-check:
   - From x NW y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
   - From y B z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z).
   - So, supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
   - This means supx(x) <= supx(z), but we need supx(z) <= infx(x) for NE. Since supx(x) <= supx(z), we can't have supx(z) <= infx(x) unless supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x), which is a very specific and unlikely case.
   - So, NE is typically not possible.

Actually, hang on. When I said x could not be SW of z, I made an error. Let's correct it:

7. SW: x is SW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From x NW y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - From y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y).
   - This means infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - We can NOT directly derive supy(x) <= infy(z) from these constraints.
   - However, if x is high enough and z is low enough, it's possible that supy(x) > infy(z), meaning x is not SW of z.
   
   Let's reconsider the constraints:
   - From x NW y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - From y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
   - From these, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
   - If infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(z), satisfying the first condition for SW.
   - However, for the second condition, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - Now, we can say infy(z) <= infy(x), but we can't derive supy(x) <= infy(z) from the constraints.
   - In fact, the constraints suggest the opposite: infy(z) <= infy(x), making it impossible for supy(x) <= infy(z) (since supy(x) < infy(x) for any valid region).
   
   So, x cannot be SW of z. Similarly for S and SE.

OK let me triple check. 

From x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

From these constraints, can x be SW of z?

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

From the constraints, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

These don't guarantee supx(x) <= infx(z), so the first condition might not always be met.

But for the second condition, let's analyze deeper:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

If we combine these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).

Now, for x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
But from the constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(x).

For a valid region x, supy(x) is always less than infy(x) (the top of a region is always above its bottom). So, supy(x) < infy(x).

Combined with infy(z) <= infy(x), we get supy(x) < infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x).

But this doesn't directly tell us if supy(x) <= infy(z) or if infy(z) <= supy(x).

Actually, wait. I think I'm making a mistake in my interpretation of the domain. Let me read the problem definition again:

A region is defined as something homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. The functions supx, supy, infx, infy refer to the supremum and infimum of the projections of the region onto the x and y axes.

For a region in REG, which is homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, the supremum of the projection of the region onto a coordinate axis is the furthest extent of the region in that direction, and the infimum is the furthest extent in the opposite direction. So, for a region x:
- infx(x) is the leftmost extent of x
- supx(x) is the rightmost extent of x
- infy(x) is the bottommost extent of x
- supy(x) is the topmost extent of x

With this understanding:
- When we say "supx(x) <= infx(y)", it means the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y.
- When we say "supy(y) <= infy(x)", it's a bit confusing since infy refers to the bottommost point. This would mean the topmost point of y is below the bottommost point of x, which doesn't seem right.

Let me double-check the definition again.

Looking at the definition, I see:
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

Ah, I think I see the mistake in my understanding. The "y" coordinate in this 2D space is actually the vertical coordinate, with larger values at the top. So, infy refers to the lowest y-value (i.e., the bottom of the region), and supy refers to the highest y-value (i.e., the top of the region).

Actually, reading the definition again, I see:
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

Wait, this is confusing. This would mean the top of b is below the bottom of a, which doesn't make sense for a region to be northwest of another. Let me carefully reread the definitions.

Ok, looking closely:
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

This is saying region a is to the northwest of region b if:
1. The rightmost point of a is to the left of the leftmost point of b (supx(a) <= infx(b)).
2. The topmost point of b is below the bottommost point of a (supy(b) <= infy(a)).

Hmm, but "supy" should refer to the top of a region, and "infy" should refer to the bottom. So, if a is northwest of b, then the top of b should be below the bottom of a? That seems unlikely, unless I'm confused, but let's go with the defined relations.

Let's redo our analysis with this understanding:

From x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (rightmost of x is left of leftmost of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (topmost of y is below bottommost of x)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (leftmost of z is left of leftmost of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (rightmost of y is right of rightmost of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (bottommost of z is below bottommost of y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (topmost of y is below topmost of z)

Let's now analyze the possible cardinal relations between x and z:

1. NW: x is NW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - From the constraints, infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y). We can't directly infer if supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - Similarly, supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). We can't directly infer if supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - So, NW is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

2. N: x is N of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - Again, the third condition isn't directly determined from the constraints.
   - So, N is possible if supy(z) <= infy(x).

3. NE: x is NE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - From the constraints, supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= infx(y). This means supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - So, NE is not possible.

4. W: x is W of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - The first condition, as discussed, isn't directly determined from the constraints.
   - For the second, we have infy(z) <= infy(y), but we can't directly infer if infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For the third, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (which means supy(y) < supy(x)), but we can't directly infer if supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - So, W is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

5. B: x is B of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From the constraints, infx(z) <= infx(y), and we know supx(x) <= infx(y). This means supx(x) <= infx(y), but we can't directly infer if infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For the other conditions, we can't directly infer from the constraints either.
   - So, B is possible if the above conditions are met.

6. E: x is E of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From the constraints, supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= infx(y). This means supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - So, E is not possible.

7. SW: x is SW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - The first condition, as discussed, isn't directly determined from the constraints.
   - For the second, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (which means supy(y) < supy(x)), and infy(z) <= infy(y). But we can't directly infer the relation between supy(x) and infy(z).
   - So, SW is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

8. S: x is S of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - The first two conditions, as discussed, aren't directly determined from the constraints.
   - For the third, similar to the SW case, we can't directly infer the relation.
   - So, S is possible if the above conditions are met.

9. SE: x is SE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From the constraints, supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= infx(y). This means supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - So, SE is not possible.

Hmm, I still seem to be arriving at potentially all cardinal directions except NE, E, and SE are possible. 

Actually, I think I haven't fully considered the constraints. Now let's take another approach.

From x NW y:
- The rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y (supx(x) <= infx(y)).
- The topmost point of y is below the bottommost point of x (supy(y) <= infy(x)).

From y B z:
- y is fully contained within the bounding box of z.

Now, if x is NW of y and y is B of z, the region x must be:
- To the left of at least part of z (since it's to the left of y, which is contained within z).
- Above at least part of z (since it's above y, which is contained within z).

Let's visualize this to clarify. 

Given:
- x is NW of y.
- y is B of z.

First, we know that y is somewhere within z's bounds. The region z can extend beyond region y in any direction.

For x to be NW of z, the rightmost point of x has to be to the left of the leftmost point of z, and the bottommost point of x has to be above the topmost point of z. But since y is within z, and x is NW of y, it's possible that x is also NW of z, especially if z doesn't extend too far to the west or north of y.

For x to be N of z, the rightmost point of x must be to the right of the leftmost point of z, and the leftmost point of x must be to the left of the rightmost point of z. And, as before, the bottommost point of x must be above the topmost point of z. Given that x is NW of y, and y is B of z, it's possible that x is N of z if z extends further west than x.

For x to be W of z, the rightmost point of x must be to the left of the leftmost point of z, the topmost point of x must be below the topmost point of z, and the bottommost point of x must be above the bottommost point of z. Given that x is NW of y, and y is B of z, it's possible that x is W of z if z extends further north than x.

For x to be B of z, x must be fully contained within the bounding box of z. Given that x is NW of y, and y is B of z, it's possible that x is B of z if z extends far enough to the west and north to encompass x.

For x to be NE, E, or SE of z, the leftmost point of x must be to the right of the rightmost point of z. But since x is to the left of y, and y is within z, it's not possible for x to be to the right of all of z. So, these three cardinal directions aren't possible.

For x to be S of z, the topmost point of x must be below the bottommost point of z. But since x is above y, and y is within z, it's not possible for x to be below all of z. So, S isn't possible.

For x to be SW of z, the rightmost point of x must be to the left of the leftmost point of z, and the topmost point of x must be below the bottommost point of z. While the former condition might be satisfied, the latter contradicts the fact that x is above y, and y is within z. So, SW isn't possible.

Thus, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are: NW, N, W, and B.

This sounds more plausible! I'll break down the reasoning to make absolutely sure.

From x NW y and y B z, can x be:
1. NW of z? Yes, if z doesn't extend too far west or north beyond y.
2. N of z? Yes, if z extends west beyond x.
3. NE of z? No, because x is to the left of y, which is within z, so x can't be entirely to the right of z.
4. W of z? Yes, if z extends north beyond x.
5. B of z? Yes, if z extends west and north beyond x.
6. E of z? No, for the same reason as NE.
7. SW of z? No, because x is above y, which is within z, so x can't be entirely below z.
8. S of z? No, for the same reason as SW.
9. SE of z? No, for the combined reasons of NE and SW.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, and B.

Let's double-check this. From x NW y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (rightmost of x is left of leftmost of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (topmost of y is below bottommost of x)

From y B z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (leftmost of z is left of leftmost of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (rightmost of y is right of rightmost of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (bottommost of z is below bottommost of y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (topmost of y is below topmost of z)

Consider x NW of z. For this, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (rightmost of x is left of leftmost of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (topmost of z is below bottommost of x)

We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). We can't determine if supx(x) <= infx(z) without more info, so it's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z).

We also know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). We can't determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) without more info, so it's also possible that supy(z) <= infy(x).

Therefore, x can be NW of z. However, as I reasoned before, regions x and z can also have the relations N, W, and B, but not NE, E, SE, S, or SW. So the final answer is: NW, N, W, B.

Actually, let me double check the SW relation.

For x SW of z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (rightmost of x is left of leftmost of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (topmost of x is below bottommost of z)

We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). We can't determine if supx(x) <= infx(z) without more info, so it's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z).

For the second condition, we know supy(y) <= infy(x), which means y is below x. We also know infy(z) <= infy(y), which means z extends below y. Since y is below x and z extends below y, we can't have the topmost point of x below the bottommost point of z. So, x can't be SW of z.

OK I think we have the answer: NW, N, W, B.

Let me make a drawing. Scenario 1: z = y. In this case, x NW y => x NW z. Scenario 2: z bounding box extends only east of y. Still, x NW y => x NW z.
Scenario 3: z bounding box extends only south of y. Still, x NW y => x NW z.
Scenario 4: z bounding box extends south and east of y. Still, x NW y => x NW z.
Scenario 5: z bounding box extends west of y. Here, x could be N of z.
Scenario 6: z bounding box extends north of y. Here, x could be W of z.
Scenario 7: z bounding box extends west and north of y, enough to encompass x. Here, x could be B of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, and B. But let me triple check the example I wasn't sure about.

For x SW of z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (rightmost of x is left of leftmost of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (topmost of x is below bottommost of z)

Given that y is B of z, and y and z are regions in REG, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) (bottommost of z is below or at the same level as the bottommost of y). This is part of the definition of y being in the bounding box of z.

Given that x is NW of y, and x and y are regions in REG, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (topmost of y is below the bottommost of x). This is part of the definition of x being northwest of y.

These two constraints give us:
infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

While I can deduce that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), I can't directly infer the relation between supy(x) and infy(z).

But let's think about it intuitively. If x is northwest of y, and y is within the bounding box of z, then x is to the northwest of at least part of z. Specifically, x is above y (so its bottommost point is above the topmost point of y), and y is part of z.

For x to be SW of z, it would need to be below z. But x is above y, and y is part of z, so x can't be entirely below z.

So, x can't be SW of z.

The other three directions, S, SE, E, NE also follow similar constraints.

For x to be S of z, its bottommost point should be above the bottommost of z, its topmost point should be below the bottommost of z, and it should overlap with z horizontally. But since x is above y, which is part of z, it can't be below the entirety of z.

For x to be SE of z, the leftmost point of x should be to the right of the rightmost point of z, and the topmost point of x should be below the bottommost point of z. But x is to the left of y, which is part of z, so x can't be to the right of all of z. Also, as argued above, x can't be below all of z.

For x to be E of z, the leftmost point of x should be to the right of the rightmost point of z. But since x is to the left of y, which is part of z, x can't be to the right of all of z.

For x to be NE of z, the leftmost point of x should be to the right of the rightmost point of z. But as reasoned above, this is not possible.

I'm pretty sure the answer is NW, N, W, and B.

But let me sanity check:
- NW: this can happen when z and y are essentially the same.
- N: z essentially includes y but extends to the west in a way that z is to the south of x (not the south-west or south-east).
- W: z essentially includes y but extends to the north in a way that z is to the east of x (not the north-east or south-east).
- B: z essentially includes y and extends both north and west enough to also include x.

But why can't x be:
- NE, E, SE: For these, the leftmost point of x needs to be to the right of the rightmost point of z. But since x is to the left of y (from x NW y), and y is within z, x can't be entirely to the right of z.
- S, SW: For these, the topmost point of x needs to be below the bottommost point of z. But since x is above y (from x NW y), and y is within z, x can't be entirely below z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, and B.

But hold, let me just double check the definition of regions in REG.
To be in REG, a region should be homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, meaning it is closed, connected, and has a connected boundary. 

From the definitions, for a region a to be in B of region b, the following conditions must be satisfied:
- infx(b) <= infx(a), which means the leftmost point of b is to the left of the leftmost point of a.
- supx(a) <= supx(b), which means the rightmost point of a is to the left of the rightmost point of b.
- infy(b) <= infy(a), which means the bottommost point of b is below the bottommost point of a.
- supy(a) <= supy(b), which means the topmost point of a is below the topmost point of b.

Essentially, B means that the region a is inside the bounding box of region b.

So, if y is B of z, it means y is inside the bounding box of z. 

With this in mind, I believe my reasoning and conclusion are consistent and correct.

The possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, and B.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal direction relationships are possible between region x and region z, based on the given constraints: "x is NW of y" and "y is B of z".

From the definitions:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  (x is completely to the northwest of y)
- y B z means: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
  (y is completely within the bounding box of z)

Let me analyze each possible direction relationship between x and z:

1. NW: Possible if z doesn't extend too far west or north beyond y
2. N: Possible if z extends west beyond x's position
3. W: Possible if z extends north beyond x's position 
4. B: Possible if z extends both west and north enough to include x

5. NE, E, SE: Not possible because x is to the left of y (which is inside z), so x cannot be entirely to the right of z
6. S, SW: Not possible because x is above y (which is inside z), so x cannot be entirely below z

The possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, B
