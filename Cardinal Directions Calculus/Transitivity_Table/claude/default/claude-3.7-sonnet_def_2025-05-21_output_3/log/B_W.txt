PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully analyze the given conditions and determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given information:
- x B y (x is in the bounding box of y)
- y W z (y is west of z)

First, let's understand what these mean geometrically:

1. x B y means:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (y's left boundary is at or to the left of x's left boundary)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is at or to the left of y's right boundary)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top boundary is at or below y's top boundary)

2. y W z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y's right boundary is at or to the left of z's left boundary)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's bottom boundary is at or below y's bottom boundary)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's top boundary is at or below z's top boundary)

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z based on these constraints.

Let's consider the x-axis constraints first:
- From x B y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

This gives us: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This means x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis. This is consistent with the definitions of W, NW, and SW relations.

Now, let's consider the y-axis constraints:
- From x B y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Hmm, this doesn't give us a strict constraint on the relative positions of x and z on the y-axis. We know that:
- z's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary
- z's top boundary is at or above x's top boundary

This means z could be higher, lower, or at the same height as x. The possible relations based on the y-axis could be W, NW, or SW.

Let's verify each possible cardinal direction relation:

1. W relation: 
   - We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which satisfies the first condition for W.
   - For W, we also need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We derived above that infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - So, x W z is a possible relation.

2. NW relation:
   - We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which satisfies the first condition for NW.
   - For NW, we also need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we derived supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which doesn't guarantee supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - So, x NW z may not be guaranteed based on the given constraints.

Actually, let me reconsider the NW relation. For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we know is satisfied)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which means x is strictly above z)

From the constraints, we have:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These don't guarantee supy(z) ≤ infy(x). In fact, they suggest the opposite: x is likely to be below or overlap with z on the y-axis. So, x NW z is not a guaranteed relation.

Let's verify the remaining possibilities:

3. SW relation:
   - We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which satisfies the first condition for SW.
   - For SW, we also need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we derived infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which doesn't guarantee supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - So, x SW z may not be guaranteed based on the given constraints.

Again, let me reconsider the SW relation. For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we know is satisfied)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which means x is strictly below z)

From the constraints, we have:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These don't guarantee supy(x) ≤ infy(z). In fact, they suggest the opposite: x is likely to be above or overlap with z on the y-axis. So, x SW z is not a guaranteed relation.

Now, let's try to visualize this differently. Since z is strictly to the right of y, and x is contained within y's bounding box, x must also be strictly to the left of z. This gives us the W, NW, or SW relations as possibilities.

But the y-axis relationship between x and z is not fully constrained. However, there's an additional constraint: x must be within y's bounding box, and y must be within z's vertical range (from y W z). This means x is also likely within z's vertical range, which aligns with the W relation.

However, let's examine the edge cases:

If x is at the top edge of y's bounding box and y is at the top edge of z's vertical range, then x could be at the same height as z's top edge. If x extends above this, it could potentially have an NW relation with z.

Similarly, if x is at the bottom edge of y's bounding box and y is at the bottom edge of z's vertical range, then x could be at the same height as z's bottom edge. If x extends below this, it could potentially have an SW relation with z.

But without more specific information about the relative positions, we can't rule out W, NW, or SW as possible relations between x and z.

Let me try to be more precise by considering concrete examples:

1. Consider x as a small region in the center of y's bounding box, and y as a region just to the left of z. In this case, x would be W of z.

2. Consider x as a small region at the top-right corner of y's bounding box, and y as a region just to the left of z with its top edge slightly below z's top edge. In this case, x could be NW of z if x extends above y's top edge.

3. Consider x as a small region at the bottom-right corner of y's bounding box, and y as a region just to the left of z with its bottom edge slightly above z's bottom edge. In this case, x could be SW of z if x extends below y's bottom edge.

Given the constraints, I believe the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Hm, but let me reconsider this more carefully. 

For x B y, x must be completely inside y's bounding box.
For y W z, y must be completely to the left of z, and y's vertical range must be within z's vertical range.

Combining these, x must be within y's bounding box, which is completely to the left of z. This means x is also completely to the left of z.

On the y-axis, y's vertical range is within z's vertical range. Since x is within y's bounding box, x's vertical range is also within y's vertical range, which in turn is within z's vertical range.

So, x's vertical range is within z's vertical range, and x is completely to the left of z. According to the definitions, this corresponds to the W relation: x W z.

Let me verify this with the formal definition:

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is strictly to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is at or below z's top boundary)

From our constraints:
- We've shown that supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
- From x B y and y W z, we have infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), which gives infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- From x B y and y W z, we have supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which gives supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

So, all the conditions for the W relation are satisfied.

But the above argument showing that the vertical range of x must be contained with the vertical range of z, because the vertical range of y is contained within the vertical range of z, assumes that the vertical range of x is contained within the vertical range of y. Let's check whether that's necessarily true from the definition of x B y.

For x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (y's left boundary is at or to the left of x's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is at or to the left of y's right boundary)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top boundary is at or below y's top boundary)

Actually, it's not true that x must be contained within the vertical range of y based on the definition of the bounding box. Rather it is true that y contains (not necessarily properly) x.

From B's definition, we actually have:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top boundary is at or below y's top boundary)

This means y's vertical range is at least as large as x's vertical range, and y's vertical extents contains x's vertical extents. 

And from y W z, we have:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's bottom boundary is at or below y's bottom boundary)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's top boundary is at or below z's top boundary)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (z's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is at or below z's top boundary)

Which means z's vertical range is at least as large as x's vertical range, and z contains x's vertical extents. This, combined with x being strictly to the left of z, indeed corresponds to the W relation: x W z.

Hmm, but I still feel like I'm making some mistake. Let me reconsider the definitions again.

Let's more precisely analyze the given conditions:

1. x B y means x is completely within y's bounding box. This is defined as:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (y's left boundary is at or to the left of x's left boundary)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is at or to the right of y's right boundary)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top boundary is at or above y's top boundary)

2. y W z means y is strictly to the west of z. This is defined as:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y's right boundary is at or to the left of z's left boundary)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's bottom boundary is at or below y's bottom boundary)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's top boundary is at or above z's top boundary)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x B y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x B y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)

This gives us:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis.

For the y-axis, we have:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x B y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x B y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y W z)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

So, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which means z's vertical range contains x's vertical range.

Given that x is strictly to the left of z and z's vertical range contains x's vertical range, the relation between x and z is W (West). So, x W z.

Actually, I'm now more confident in this answer. Let's confirm by checking all the possible cardinal direction relations:

1. N (North): For this, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts our derived supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x N z is not possible.

2. NE (North East): For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we derived supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means infx(z) ≤ supx(x), contradicting supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

3. E (East): For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts our derived supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x E z is not possible.

4. SE (South East): For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But we derived supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x SE z is not possible.

5. S (South): For this, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts our derived infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x S z is not possible.

6. SW (South West): For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We derived supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but also infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

7. W (West): For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've derived all of these conditions, so x W z is a possible relation.

8. NW (North West): For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We derived supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but also supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NW z is not possible.

9. B (Bounding Box): For this, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We derived infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), but we also derived supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z, contradicting the requirement for B. So, x B z is not possible.

From this analysis, it's clear that the only possible relation between x and z is W (West).

Actually, let me double-check my analysis for the SW, NW, and W relations once more, because those are borderline cases depending on the y-axis.

For SW (South West) relation, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we confirmed)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is strictly below z)

From our derived constraints:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (which means z's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)

This contradicts the requirement supy(x) ≤ infy(z) for the SW relation. So, x SW z is not a possible relation.

For NW (North West) relation, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we confirmed)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly above z)

From our derived constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (which means x's top boundary is at or below z's top boundary)

This contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for the NW relation. So, x NW z is not a possible relation.

For W (West) relation, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we confirmed)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is at or below z's top boundary)

We've derived all of these conditions:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

So, the W relation is satisfied.

Based on this more detailed analysis, I'm more confident that the only possible relation between x and z is W (West).

Actually, hold on. I need to read the original definitions and formalization more carefully, because I suspect that there might still be some issue, so let me check.

First, let's clarify what "x B y" means. From the definition:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

Applying this to x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (y's left boundary is at or to the left of x's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right boundary is at or to the right of y's right boundary)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top boundary is at or above y's top boundary)

This means x is completely within y's bounding box.

Next, "y W z" means:
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

Applying this to y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y's right boundary is at or to the left of z's left boundary)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom boundary is at or below y's bottom boundary)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top boundary is at or below z's top boundary)

Now, let's put these together to see if I can detect any mistakes I might have made.

From x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's check the definition for the W relation again:
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we derived)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we derived)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we derived)

So, all the conditions for x W z are satisfied. x W z is a valid relation.

Now, let's try to find other cardinal direction relations that might be satisfied. Let's check the definitions for the cardinal direction relations again, one by one and be more precise in our derivations:

1. x B z (Bounding Box):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From our derivation, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis.
   - This contradicts the requirement for B that x's left boundary is within z's x-range. Therefore, x B z is not a valid relation.

2. x S z (South):
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   From our derivation, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis.
   - This contradicts the requirement for S that x's x-range is contained within z's x-range. Therefore, x S z is not a valid relation.

3. x SW z (South West):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   From our derivation, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z), which is satisfied.
   - infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement for SW that x is strictly below z on the y-axis (supy(x) <= infy(z)). Therefore, x SW z is not a valid relation.

4. x W z (West):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From our derivation, all these conditions are satisfied. Therefore, x W z is a valid relation.

5. x NW z (North West):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   From our derivation, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z), which is satisfied.
   - supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the requirement for NW that x is strictly above z on the y-axis (supy(z) <= infy(x)). Therefore, x NW z is not a valid relation.

6. x N z (North):
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   From our derivation, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis.
   - This contradicts the requirement for N that x's x-range is contained within z's x-range. Therefore, x N z is not a valid relation.

7. x NE z (North East):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   From our derivation, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis.
   - This contradicts the requirement for NE that x is strictly to the right of z on the x-axis (supx(z) <= infx(x)). Therefore, x NE z is not a valid relation.

8. x E z (East):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From our derivation, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis.
   - This contradicts the requirement for E that x is strictly to the right of z on the x-axis (supx(z) <= infx(x)). Therefore, x E z is not a valid relation.

9. x SE z (South East):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   From our derivation, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis.
   - This contradicts the requirement for SE that x is strictly to the right of z on the x-axis (supx(z) <= infx(x)). Therefore, x SE z is not a valid relation.

After checking all the possible cardinal direction relations, I can confirm that the only valid relation is x W z.

Let me double check the definition of W though. According to the definition:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the given conditions, we've already shown that these constraints are satisfied. Therefore, x W z is indeed a valid relation.

Let's review how we derived this. We know:
- From x B y: infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, all the conditions for x W z are met.

Actually, let's stop and think more intuitively to see if the answer we found is correct. Since x B y means that x is in the bounding box of y, we know that:
- y extends at least as far left as x
- y extends at least as far right as x
- y extends at least as far down as x
- y extends at least as far up as x

And since y W z, we know that y is strictly to the left of z, and y's vertical range is within z's vertical range.

Combining these, we can visually see that x is strictly to the left of z, and x's vertical range is within z's vertical range. This corresponds to the W relation. Just to be extra sure, let's use concrete examples:

Let y be a square with its bottom-left corner at (2, 2) and its top-right corner at (4, 4).
Let x be a square with its bottom-left corner at (2.5, 2.5) and its top-right corner at (3.5, 3.5).
Let z be a square with its bottom-left corner at (6, 1) and its top-right corner at (8, 5).

Then:
- infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2.5
- supx(x) = 3.5 <= supx(y) = 4
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2.5
- supy(x) = 3.5 <= supy(y) = 4

So, x is in the bounding box of y (x B y is valid).

- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 6
- infy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2
- supy(y) = 4 <= supy(z) = 5

So, y is west of z (y W z is valid).

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = 3.5 <= infx(z) = 6
- infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2.5
- supy(x) = 3.5 <= supy(z) = 5

So, x is west of z (x W z is valid).

Hmm, let's actually double-check our derivations and our reasoning.

Given information:
- x B y
- y W z

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Logically deducing the constraints between x and z:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x B y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z)
- Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z)

- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
- Therefore, infy(z) <= infy(x)

- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z)
- Therefore, supy(x) <= supy(z)

Checking against the cardinal directions:

For W, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

These are exactly the constraints we derived. Therefore, x W z is valid.

I believe that the relation between x and z is W.

Actually, let's check a potential edge case where x is at the exact boundary of y's bounding box.

Let's say:
- y is a square with bottom-left corner at (2, 2) and top-right corner at (4, 4).
- z is a square with bottom-left corner at (6, 1) and top-right corner at (8, 5).

Now, let's place x at the boundary of y:
Case 1: x is a square with bottom-left corner at (2, 2) and top-right corner at (3, 3). Here, x is at the bottom-left corner of y.
Case 2: x is a square with bottom-left corner at (3, 3) and top-right corner at (4, 4). Here, x is at the top-right corner of y.

Let's check the relation between x and z for both cases:

Case 1:
- supx(x) = 3 <= infx(z) = 6
- infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2
- supy(x) = 3 <= supy(z) = 5

So, x W z is valid.

Case 2:
- supx(x) = 4 <= infx(z) = 6
- infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 3
- supy(x) = 4 <= supy(z) = 5

So, x W z is valid.

These examples confirm our derivation that the relation between x and z is W.

Now, let's also consider the most extreme cases:

Case 3: x is a point at (4, 4), the top-right corner of y.
- supx(x) = 4 <= infx(z) = 6
- infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 4
- supy(x) = 4 <= supy(z) = 5

So, x W z is valid.

Case 4: x is a point at (2, 2), the bottom-left corner of y.
- supx(x) = 2 <= infx(z) = 6
- infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2
- supy(x) = 2 <= supy(z) = 5

So, x W z is valid.

All these cases confirm that the relation between x and z is W.

Actually, wait, I think I should also double-check potential extreme cases for z:

Case 5: z's vertical range exactly matches y's vertical range.
- y is a square with bottom-left corner at (2, 2) and top-right corner at (4, 4).
- z is a square with bottom-left corner at (6, 2) and top-right corner at (8, 4).
- x is a square with bottom-left corner at (2.5, 2.5) and top-right corner at (3.5, 3.5).

This means:
- supx(x) = 3.5 <= infx(z) = 6
- infy(z) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2.5
- supy(x) = 3.5 <= supy(z) = 4

So, x W z is valid.

Case 6: Extreme case where z's vertical range extends just enough to satisfy the relation with y.
- y is a square with bottom-left corner at (2, 2) and top-right corner at (4, 4).
- z is a square with bottom-left corner at (6, 1.9) and top-right corner at (8, 4.1).
- x is a square with bottom-left corner at (2.5, 2.5) and top-right corner at (3.5, 3.5).

This means:
- supx(x) = 3.5 <= infx(z) = 6
- infy(z) = 1.9 <= infy(x) = 2.5
- supy(x) = 3.5 <= supy(z) = 4.1

So, x W z is valid.

These extreme cases also confirm that the relation between x and z is W.

Alright, I'm now very confident that the only possible relation between x and z is W (West).

Actually, one more thing: regions are not just points or simple shapes like squares, but rather any region homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. So we should also consider the flexibility in the shapes. But the constraints are fundamentally based on the infimum and supremum of the projections, which remain the same regardless of the specific shape within the given bounds.

So even when we consider a wide range of possible shapes, the relation between x and z can only be W, given the constraints. This is because we've shown that for any region x that satisfies the constraint x B y, and any region z for which y W z is satisfied, the relation between x and z can only be W.

Therefore, the answer to the question "If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is only W (West).

But actually, hold on one second. Before I finalize this, let me once again check whether I'm correctly interpreting the definitions given in the problem statement. 

Let's revisit the definition of the bounding box relation (B):
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

This means the region a is completely contained within the bounding box of b. Applying to x B y, it means x is completely within the bounding box of y.

Now, the definition of the West relation (W):
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

This means region a is strictly to the west (or left) of region b, and the vertical range of a is contained within the vertical range of b. Applying to y W z, it means y is strictly to the west of z, and y's vertical range is within z's vertical range.

Given these interpretations, our derivation is correct. By deducing the constraints between x and z from the given information, we find that the relation is x W z. That is, x is west of z.

So my final answer is that the only possible relation between x and z is W (West).

Actually, let's double check again, using the provided definitions.

Given:
1. x B y means x is within the bounding box of y. From the provided definition, this is:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) (y's left boundary is at or to the left of x's left boundary)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right boundary is at or to the right of y's right boundary)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top boundary is at or above y's top boundary)

2. y W z means y is west of z. From the provided definition, this is:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y's right boundary is to the left of z's left boundary)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom boundary is at or below y's bottom boundary)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top boundary is at or below z's top boundary)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:

From x B y and y W z, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x B y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z)
- Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z)

- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
- Therefore, infy(z) <= infy(x)

- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z)
- Therefore, supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, checking against the definition of W:
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we derived)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we derived)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we derived)

So, all the conditions for x W z are satisfied.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is W (West).

def check_bounding_box(a, b):
    """Check if region a is in the bounding box of region b."""
    infx_a, supx_a = a[0], a[1]
    infy_a, supy_a = a[2], a[3]
    
    infx_b, supx_b = b[0], b[1]
    infy_b, supy_b = b[2], b[3]

            infy_b <= infy_a and supy_a <= supy_b)

# Define some sample regions
y = (2, 4, 2, 4)  # (infx, supx, infy, supy)
z = (6, 8, 1, 5)

# Check various positions of x
x1 = (2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5)
x2 = (2, 3, 2, 3)
x3 = (3, 4, 3, 4)
x4 = (2, 2, 2, 2)
x5 = (4, 4, 4, 4)

for x in [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]:
    if check_bounding_box(x, y):
        relation = "x is in the bounding box of y"
    else:
        relation = "x is NOT in the bounding box of y"
    print(f"For x={x}, {relation}")
    
    if check_west(x, z):
        relation = "x is west of z"
    else:
        relation = "x is NOT west of z"
    print(f"For x={x}, {relation}")
    print()

All of these examples confirm that when x is in the bounding box of y and y is west of z, then x is also west of z.

Actually, let me make sure I'm correct by checking all the possible cardinal direction relations using the definitions from the problem statement. (I'm re-writing these here for clarity):

1. B (bounding box): 
   a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

2. S (south): 
   a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

3. SW (south west): 
   a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

4. W (west): 
   a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

5. NW (north west): 
   a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

6. N (north): 
   a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

7. NE (north east): 
   a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

8. E (east): 
   a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

9. SE (south east): 
   a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Given:
1. x B y means:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. y W z means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, for the relation between x and z, let's try all nine cardinal direction relations:

1. B (bounding box): For x B z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (satisfied)
   But, we have supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition for B. So, x B z is not valid.

2. S (south): For x S z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   But, we have infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for S. So, x S z is not valid.

3. SW (south west): For x SW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   But, we have infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for SW. So, x SW z is not valid.

4. W (west): For x W z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (satisfied)
   All the conditions for W are satisfied. So, x W z is valid.

5. NW (north west): For x NW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   But, we have supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for NW. So, x NW z is not valid.

6. N (north): For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   But, we have supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for N. So, x N z is not valid.

7. NE (north east): For x NE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   But, we have supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z. This contradicts the condition for NE that x is strictly to the right of z. So, x NE z is not valid.

8. E (east): For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (satisfied)
   But, we have supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z. This contradicts the condition for E that x is strictly to the right of z. So, x E z is not valid.

9. SE (south east): For x SE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   But, we have supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z. This contradicts the condition for SE that x is strictly to the right of z. So, x SE z is not valid.

After checking all the possible cardinal direction relations, I confirm that the only valid relation between x and z is W (West).

Therefore, if region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is W (West).

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, let me determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x B y (x is in the bounding box of y)
- y W z (y is west of z)

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) 
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), therefore supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), therefore infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), therefore supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

These three derived constraints exactly match the definition of the W relation:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is strictly to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is at or below z's top boundary)

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is W.
