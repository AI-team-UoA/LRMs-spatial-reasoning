PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, we know:
- x is NE of y
- y is B of z

Let's recall the definitions:
- "a NE b" means supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- "a B b" means infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, we need to determine what these conditions imply for the relation between x and z.

From the given conditions, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

However, these conditions don't give us a direct relationship between x and z in terms of the relative positions of their projections on the x and y axes.

Let's analyze the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the east of z.
2. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is to the north of z.

But we don't know if either of these conditions holds based on the given information.

However, let's see if we can narrow down the possibilities.

If x is NE of y and y is B of z, then:
- x is to the north-east of y
- y is within the bounding box of z

Since y is within the bounding box of z, z can extend in any direction beyond y. However, x is to the north-east of y, so x is also to the north-east of the part of z that overlaps with y.

But z could extend beyond y in various directions, and the relation between x and z would depend on how far z extends.

If z extends far to the east beyond y, then x might be N of z.
If z extends far to the north beyond y, then x might be E of z.
If z extends to both north and east but not beyond x, then x might be NE of z.
If z extends beyond x in both north and east directions, then x might be B of z.

Wait, can x be B of z? Let's see. For x to be B of z, we would need:
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given that x is NE of y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

And given that y is B of z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't tell us the relation between infx(x) and supx(z).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), but this doesn't tell us the relation between infy(x) and supy(z).

So, based solely on the given constraints, we can't determine if x can be B of z. However, let's continue thinking...

I think I'm making this too complicated. Let's think of it in terms of regions on a 2D plane.

If x is NE of y, then x is in the north-east quadrant relative to y.
If y is B of z, then y is completely contained within the bounding box of z.

So, x is in the north-east quadrant relative to y, and y is somewhere inside the bounding box of z.

Given these conditions, what could be the relation between x and z?

1. If z exactly matches y (i.e., z = y), then x would be NE of z.
2. If z extends beyond y in directions other than NE, but still doesn't overlap with the NE quadrant relative to y, then x would still be NE of z.
3. If z extends into the NE quadrant relative to y, it could overlap with x. Depending on the extent of overlap, x could be in various relations with z. If z completely contains x, then x would be B of z. If z partially overlaps with x from the west, then x could be E of z. If z partially overlaps with x from the south, then x could be N of z. If z overlaps with x from the south-west but not from the north or east, then x could be NE of z.
4. If z extends towards the NE quadrant but doesn't overlap with x, x could be N of z, E of z, or NE of z, depending on the exact shape and extent of z.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- NE (if z doesn't extend beyond y in the NE direction)
- N (if z extends to the east beyond y but not north beyond x)
- E (if z extends to the north beyond y but not east beyond x)
- B (if z completely contains x)
- OR potentially even NW, SE, or S if z has a very irregular shape, but I think this is less likely given the constraints.

But wait, I want to check if NW, SE, or S are even possibilities. Let's review the definitions once more.

For x to be NW of z, we would need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

Given that x is NE of y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

And given that y is B of z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). But for x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). These two conditions contradict each other. So, x cannot be NW of z.

Similarly, we can check for SE and S. I'll skip the detailed derivation for brevity, but using the same approach, we can determine that x cannot be SE or S of z.

Let's also check for SW:

For x to be SW of z, we would need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

Given that x is NE of y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

And given that y is B of z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). But for x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). These two conditions contradict each other. So, x cannot be SW of z.

Let's check for W:

For x to be W of z, we would need:
supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given that x is NE of y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

And given that y is B of z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). But for x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). These two conditions contradict each other. So, x cannot be W of z.

Now, let's verify if x can be N, E, NE, or B of z.

For x to be N of z, we would need:
supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Given that x is NE of y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

And given that y is B of z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x).
- We don't know the relation between supx(x) and supx(z).

So, based on the given constraints, it's possible for x to be N of z, but it's not guaranteed.

Let's check for E:

For x to be E of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given that x is NE of y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

And given that y is B of z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
- We don't know the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).

So, based on the given constraints, it's possible for x to be E of z, but it's not guaranteed.

Let's check for NE:

For x to be NE of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

Given that x is NE of y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

And given that y is B of z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).

So, based on the given constraints, it's possible for x to be NE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

Let's check for B:

For x to be B of z, we would need:
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given that x is NE of y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

And given that y is B of z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). If infx(y) < supx(y), this would imply infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < infx(x). This contradicts the requirement for x to be B of z, which is infx(z) <= infx(x). However, if infx(y) = supx(y), then the derivation would be infx(z) <= infx(y) = supx(y) <= infx(x), which doesn't necessarily contradict the requirement.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let's step back and think about this more intuitively.

If x is NE of y, it means x is strictly in the north-east quadrant relative to y. There's no overlap between x and y.

If y is B of z, it means y is completely contained within the bounding box of z. It doesn't mean y covers the entire bounding box of z. Z could extend beyond y in any or all directions.

So, what are the possible relations between x and z?

1. If z doesn't extend beyond y in the north or east direction, then x would be NE of z.
2. If z extends beyond y to the east but not north, then x could be N of z.
3. If z extends beyond y to the north but not east, then x could be E of z.
4. If z extends beyond y to both north and east, then x could be inside the bounding box of z (i.e., B of z) or it could still be outside the bounding box of z, in which case it could be NE, N, or E of z, depending on how far z extends.

Wait, let me visualize this better. I'm thinking of it in terms of the 2D plane, where the relations are based on the relative positions of the regions. But I want to make sure I understand the definitions correctly. The definition for "a B b" mean that a is inside the bounding box of b. But it doesn't necessarily mean that a is strictly inside b. Similarly for other cardinal directions.

Actually, let me approach the problem slightly differently.

We know that "a NE b" is defined as supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
In relation to our problem, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

Also, "a B b" is defined as infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
In relation to our problem, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Now, let's enumerate the possible relations between x and z.

For x to be N of z, we would need:
supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From our constraints, we can derive:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between infx(z) and infx(x).
- We don't know the relation between supx(x) and supx(z).

Given the constraints, we can have situations where supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). For instance, if z is a square, y is a smaller square strictly inside z, and x is a square strictly in the northeast quadrant of y, then x can be N of z if z extends far to the east but not much to the north.

For x to be NE of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From our constraints, we can derive:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).

Given the constraints, we can have situations where supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). For instance, if z is identical to y, then x would be NE of z. Or if z extends beyond y but not into the NE quadrant, then x would still be NE of z.

For x to be E of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From our constraints, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
- We don't know the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).

Given the constraints, we can have situations where supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). For instance, if z is a square, y is a smaller square strictly inside z, and x is a square strictly in the northeast quadrant of y, then x can be E of z if z extends far to the north but not much to the east.

For x to be B of z, we would need:
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From our constraints, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
- We don't know the relation between supx(x) and supx(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z).

Given the constraints, we can have situations where infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). For instance, if z is a very large region that contains both y and x, then x would be B of z.

Let's check the remaining cardinal directions:

For x to be S of z, we would need:
supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From our constraints, we can derive:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This implies supy(y) <= infy(x), which means y is south of x. And if y is south of x, and z contains y, then it's unlikely that x would be south of z. So, it's not possible for x to be S of z.

For x to be SW of z, we would need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From our constraints, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). But for x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). These two conditions contradict each other. So, x cannot be SW of z.

For x to be W of z, we would need:
supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From our constraints, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). But for x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). These two conditions contradict each other. So, x cannot be W of z.

For x to be NW of z, we would need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From our constraints, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). But for x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). These two conditions contradict each other. So, x cannot be NW of z.

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From our constraints, we can derive:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This implies supy(y) <= infy(x), which means y is south of x. And if y is south of x, and z contains y, then it's unlikely that x would be southeast of z. So, it seems unlikely for x to be SE of z.

Let's logically this. Let's be more precise and check the SE relation.

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From our constraints:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't tell us if supx(z) <= infx(x).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). It doesn't tell us about supy(x) in relation to infy(z).

It's possible for x to be above y but not extend below the top of z (since y is B of z). Thus is seems unlikely but let's check more carefully.

Let's see... if x is NE of y, then supy(y) <= infy(x). And if y is B of z, then infy(z) <= infy(y). Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).

This means infy(z) <= infy(x), which is consistent with the condition for x to be N, NE, E, or B of z. But for x to be SE of z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z). This would imply supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), meaning supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction because infy(x) <= supy(x) by definition. So, x cannot be SE of z.

Let's also double check the case for S:

For x to be S of z, we would need:
supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From our constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with the first condition for x to be S of z.
- We don't know the relation between supx(x) and supx(z), so the second condition might be satisfied.
- But again, if x is NE of y, then supy(y) <= infy(x). And if y is B of z, then infy(z) <= infy(y). Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x). But for x to be S of z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z). This would imply supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), meaning supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction because infy(x) <= supy(x) by definition. So, x cannot be S of z.

Let me double check some of the earlier results again:

For x to be N of z, we would need:
supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From our constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x). This satisfies the second condition.
- We don't know the relation between supx(x) and supx(z), so the third condition might be satisfied.

Given the constraints, N could be a possible relation between x and z.

For x to be NE of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From our constraints:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).

Given the constraints, NE could be a possible relation between x and z.

For x to be E of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From our constraints:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x). This satisfies the second condition.
- We don't know the relation between supy(x) and supy(z), so the third condition might be satisfied.

Given the constraints, E could be a possible relation between x and z.

For x to be B of z, we would need:
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From our constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x). This satisfies the first condition.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x). This satisfies the third condition.
- We don't know the relation between supx(x) and supx(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z), so the second and fourth conditions might be satisfied.

Given the constraints, B could be a possible relation between x and z.

The results of our analysis seem to indicate that B, N, NE, and E are the possible relations between x and z.

Let me double check a case that I'm a bit uncertain about:

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From our constraints:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).

But for the second condition of SE, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). This doesn't seem to be directly implied by our constraints. Is it possible to have supy(x) <= infy(z) given the constraints?

If infy(z) <= infy(x), and if infy(x) is strictly less than supy(x) (which is true by definition of a region), then we have infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). And if infy(z) < supy(x), then it's not possible to have supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SE of z.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is B of z, are:
B, N, NE, and E.

Let me double check this conclusion by sketching some examples and checking if it's possible for x to be W of z (which I concluded it can't), SE of z (which I concluded it can't) and so on. 

If x is NE of y, then x will be strictly at the northeast corner of y (no overlap). And if y is B of z, then y will be inside the bounding box of z.

Let's picture this and try to place z, y, and x in the 2D plane.

First, let's place y. Then, x will be in the NE quadrant of y. And z will be such that y is inside its bounding box.

Now, can x be W of z? It would mean that x is to the west of z, or x is strictly to the left of z on the x-axis. But if x is NE of y, then supx(y) <= infx(x). And if y is B of z, then infx(z) <= infx(y). Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= infx(x). But for x to be W of z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z). This would imply supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), meaning supx(x) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction because infx(x) <= supx(x) by definition. So, x cannot be W of z.

Similar reasoning can be applied to show that x cannot be NW, SW, S, or SE of z.

But it's easy to see that x can be:
- B of z (if z is large and encompasses both y and x)
- NE of z (if z doesn't extend much beyond y to the north or east)
- N of z (if z extends far to the east but not much to the north)
- E of z (if z extends far to the north but not much to the east)

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is B of z, are:
B, N, NE, and E.

Actually, let me double check the SE case a bit more formally.

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From our constraints:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y).

The second condition for x to be SE of z is supy(x) <= infy(z). But from our constraints, we have:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).

This means infy(z) <= supy(x), which does not guarantee supy(x) <= infy(z). In fact, if infy(z) < supy(x), then supy(x) cannot be less than or equal to infy(z), which means the second condition for SE cannot be satisfied. So, given the constraints, it's unlikely for x to be SE of z. However, let's think of one scenario:

If (we let) infy(z) = supy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(z) would be satisfied. And if (we let) supx(z) = infx(x), then supx(z) <= infx(x) would also be satisfied. In such a case, x would be SE of z.

But is it possible to have infy(z) = supy(x)? From our constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). For infy(z) to be equal to supy(x), all these inequalities would need to be equalities, which is a very restrictive condition.

I think it's more reasonable to stick with the conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are:
B, N, NE, and E.

Let me double check SE once more.

We have x NE of y, which means:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

And we have y B of z, which means:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From the given conditions, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This only tells us that infy(z) <= infy(x), and doesn't give us information about supy(x) in relation to infy(z).

So, based on the given conditions, we can have scenarios where x is SE of z. For example, if z is shaped like an "L" with y inside it, and x is located at the southeast corner of z, then x could be SE of z.

Let me re-evaluate this. For x to be SE of z:
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x), which can be made to be true with certain configurations of y, x, and z.
- We also need supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which implies infy(z) <= supy(x). This doesn't guarantee supy(x) <= infy(z).

Can we have supy(x) <= infy(z) given our constraints? It seems unlikely. If infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), then infy(z) <= supy(x). For supy(x) to be less than or equal to infy(z), we would need infy(z) = supy(x). But this would mean infy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y) = infy(x) = supy(x), which is unlikely for regions that are defined to have connected boundaries (since a region's interior would vanish under such conditions).

So, it's reasonable to say that it's highly unlikely for x to be SE of z given the constraints. While I can't definitively rule out the SE relation based on the given constraints, it's much more likely for x to be in the B, N, NE, or E relation with z.

In summary, the most likely relations between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is B of z, are:
B, N, NE, and E.

Actually, let's check once more.

For a region a, if infy(a) = supy(a), is a still a valid region in REG? According to the definition, regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. If infy(a) = supy(a), then a would be squashed flat in the y-direction, which doesn't preserve the topological properties of a disk. So, such an a would not be in REG. This means that infy(a) < supy(a) for all regions a in REG.

Using this insight, if infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), then infy(z) < supy(x) (since infy(z) <= supy(y) < supy(x)). This means supy(x) cannot be less than or equal to infy(z), which means the condition for x to be SE of z cannot be satisfied.

Therefore, x cannot be SE of z given the constraints.

Looking at the other cardinal directions, we can also rule out the NW relation for similar reasons.

For x to be NW of z, we would need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From our constraints:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). This means infx(z) <= supx(x), which doesn't guarantee supx(x) <= infx(z). In fact, if infx(z) < supx(x), then supx(x) cannot be less than or equal to infx(z), which means the first condition for NW cannot be satisfied.

So, x cannot be NW of z given the constraints. And as I've previously established, x cannot be W, SW, S, or SE of z either.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is B of z, are:
B, N, NE, and E.

Here's a more concise summation of what are the possible relations and why:

1. B (Bounding Box):
   For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From our constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x) (derived) and infy(z) <= infy(x) (derived), so two of the four conditions are satisfied. The other two conditions can be satisfied depending on the exact configuration of x, y, and z. So, B is a possible relation.

2. N (North):
   For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From our constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x) (derived), and the other two conditions can be satisfied depending on the exact configuration of x, y, and z. So, N is a possible relation.

3. NE (Northeast):
   For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Both conditions can be satisfied depending on the exact configuration of x, y, and z. So, NE is a possible relation.

4. E (East):
   For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From our constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(x) (derived), and the other two conditions can be satisfied depending on the exact configuration of x, y, and z. So, E is a possible relation.

5. SE (Southeast):
   For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   From our constraints, we can derive infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which means infy(z) <= supy(x). If infy(z) < supy(x), then supy(x) cannot be less than or equal to infy(z), which means the second condition for SE cannot be satisfied. Since regions in REG have infy(a) < supy(a), it follows that infy(z) < supy(x), making SE an impossible relation.

6. S, SW, W, NW:
   Similar reasoning can be applied to rule out these relations.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
B, N, NE, and E.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is NE of y
- y is B of z

I'll analyze what these conditions tell us:

For x NE of y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

For y B of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Examining each possible relation between x and z:

- B: Possible if z extends far enough to contain x
- N: Possible if z extends east past x but not north past x
- NE: Possible if z doesn't extend beyond y in the northeast direction
- E: Possible if z extends north past x but not east past x

The relations S, SW, W, NW, and SE are impossible due to the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: B, N, NE, E
