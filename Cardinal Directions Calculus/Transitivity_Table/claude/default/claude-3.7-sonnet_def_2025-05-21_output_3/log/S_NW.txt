PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me reason through this step by step.

We know that:
1. Region x is S of region y. This means:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is within y's horizontal extent)

2. Region y is NW of region z. This means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the above, we can deduce:
- Since supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), we have both x and z below y, but we can't directly determine the vertical relationship between x and z.
- Since supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y), we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

So, x is to the left of z, but the vertical relationship can be varied.

Let's analyze the potential cardinal directions:

1. SW: This means x is to the left of z and above z. But we know both x and z are below y, so we don't know their relative vertical positions. SW is a possibility if x is above z.

2. W: This means x is to the left of z, and they overlap vertically. W is a possibility if x and z have overlapping vertical extents.

3. NW: This means x is to the left of z and below z. NW is a possibility if x is below z.

From the conditions, we can't determine whether x is above, at the same level, or below z, so SW, W, and NW are all possible relations.

Let me double check this:

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z) ✓
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z) ❓

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z) ✓
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (vertical overlap) ❓

For x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z) ✓
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x) ❓

Wait, I see a problem with my reasoning. Since region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, let's carefully trace the vertical relationships again.

1. x is S of y means supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
2. y is NW of z means supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

These two conditions don't directly give us the vertical relationship between x and z. Let's think about it geometrically: 
- x is below y
- z is below y

We cannot determine whether x is above, below, or at the same vertical level as z based on these facts. Both x and z are below y, but their relative positions to each other can vary.

So, given that x is to the left of z, the possible cardinal directions are:

1. SW: If x is above z.
2. W: If x and z have overlapping vertical extents.
3. NW: If x is below z.

Hmm, actually I don't think that's right. Let me reconsider the condition "y is NW of z" more carefully.

For y to be NW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

So, z is below y, not above. That's why I was confused.

1. x is S of y means x is below y.
2. y is NW of z means y is above z.

So, x is below y and y is above z. Let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. If x is above z, then x could be SW, S, or SE of z.
2. If x is at the same vertical level as z, then x could be W, B, or E of z.
3. If x is below z, then x could be NW, N, or NE of z.

But, we also know that x is to the left of z (because supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)). This eliminates the possibilities S, SE, B, E, N, and NE.

So, the possible relations are:
1. SW (x is above z and to the left)
2. W (x and z have overlapping vertical extents, and x is to the left)
3. NW (x is below z and to the left)

Hmm, wait. I realized I need to be more careful when thinking about "above" and "below" in this context. Let me clarify:

1. x is S of y means x is south (or below) y.
2. y is NW of z means y is northwest (above and to the left) of z.

In terms of coordinates:
1. x is S of y means that the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of y. (supy(x) ≤ infy(y))
2. y is NW of z means the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) AND the minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of z (infy(y) ≥ supy(z)).

Here, "above" in terms of the 2D plane means having higher y-coordinates. So, if y is above z, then y has higher y-coordinates than z.

From this:
1. x is below y (because x is S of y).
2. y is above z (because y is NW of z).

But we can't directly determine the vertical relationship between x and z from these facts. x could be above, below, or at the same vertical level as z.

However, we know that x is to the left of z because:
1. infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x is S of y).
2. supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y is NW of z).
3. Combining, we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Given that x is to the left of z, the possible cardinal directions are:
1. SW (if x is above z)
2. W (if x and z have overlapping vertical extents)
3. NW (if x is below z)

But let me check once more with the formal definitions.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (✓, we've established this)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (for x to be below z in the 2D plane, which we're uncertain about)

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (✓, we've established this)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (for vertical overlap, which we're uncertain about)

For x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (✓, we've established this)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (for x to be above z in the 2D plane, which we're uncertain about)

Given that we're uncertain about the vertical relationship between x and z, all three relations (SW, W, NW) are possible.

But wait, let's double-check the definition of the relations. For the vertical orientation, if x is SW of z, then x is below z. If x is NW of z, then x is above z.

According to the given definitions:

x SW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
x W z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
x NW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Hmm, for SW, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) means the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of z. This means x is below z, not above.

For NW, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) means the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x. This means z is below x, or in other words, x is above z (in the 2D plane).

Ok, so I need to correct the relation of "above" and "below" in terms of these cardinal directions:

- If x is SW of z, then x is to the left of z and below z.
- If x is W of z, then x is to the left of z and vertically overlaps with z.
- If x is NW of z, then x is to the left of z and above z.

Now, given what we know, let's re-analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. x is S of y means x is below y (meaning supy(x) ≤ infy(y) in coordinate terms).
2. y is NW of z means y is to the left of z and above z (meaning supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) in coordinate terms).

From these, we can deduce that x is to the left of z. But we need to determine the vertical relationship between x and z.

We know that x is below y and y is above z. From transitivity, we might conclude that x is above z, but that's not necessarily the case. x being below y doesn't guarantee any specific relation with z.

In fact, let's try to visualize possible configurations:

1. z could be so far below that even though x is below y, x might still be above z.
2. z could overlap vertically with x.
3. z could be so high that even though it's below y, it might still be above x.

Given these possibilities, the possible cardinal directions for the relation between x and z are:
- SW (if z is above x)
- W (if z and x overlap vertically)
- NW (if z is below x)

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let me revise what we know:

1. x is S of y means:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal extent is contained within y's)

2. y is NW of z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

From the first set of conditions, we know that x is below y and within y's horizontal extent. From the second set, we know that y is to the left of z and above z.

If x is below y and within y's horizontal extent, and y is to the left of z, then x is also to the left of z. But determining the vertical relationship between x and z is more complex.

It's clear that y is above both x and z. But we still need to determine: Is x above z, below z, or do they have overlapping vertical extents?

Given the conditions, all these scenarios are possible. So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is below z)
- W (if x and z have overlapping vertical extents)
- NW (if x is above z)

But actually, looking back at the definitions, I think I've been consistently mixing up "above" and "below" in the 2D-plane sense.

For clarity, in a 2D plane with y-coordinates increasing upwards:
- "Above" means having higher y-coordinates.
- "Below" means having lower y-coordinates.

Now, let's reconsider the relations:

1. x SW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - This means x is to the left of z (because supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
   - And x is below z (because supy(x) ≤ infy(z), meaning the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of z).

2. x W z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - This means x is to the left of z (because supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
   - And x and z vertically overlap (because infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

3. x NW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - This means x is to the left of z (because supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
   - And x is above z (because supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x).

Yes, I was mixed up. For SW, x is below z. For NW, x is above z.

Let me again determine the possible relations between x and z based on what we know:

1. x is S of y means:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal extent is within y's)

2. y is NW of z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

From these, I already established that x is to the left of z. Now I need to determine the vertical relationship.

We know that x is below y (because supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) and z is below y (because supy(z) ≤ infy(y)). But this doesn't tell us directly the vertical relationship between x and z.

All three scenarios are possible: x could be above z, below z, or they could have overlapping vertical extents.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is below z)
- W (if x and z have overlapping vertical extents)
- NW (if x is above z)

Wait, I'm still confusing myself about "above" and "below" in the context of the cardinal directions. Let me re-read the definitions.

The definition for S is: a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

This means a is "south" of b, or in other words, a is "below" b in the 2D plane.

That is, if region a is S of region b, then supy(a) ≤ infy(b), which means the maximum y-coordinate of a is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of b. This confirms that a is below b in the 2D plane.

Similarly, for NW: a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).

This means a is "northwest" of b, or a is "above and to the left" of b in the 2D plane.

If region a is NW of region b, then supy(b) ≤ infy(a), which means the maximum y-coordinate of b is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of a. This confirms that a is above b in the 2D plane.

Now, the definitions for SW, W, and NW:

- x SW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). 
  - This means x is to the left of z (because supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and x is below z (because supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).

- x W z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  - This means x is to the left of z (because supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and they vertically overlap.

- x NW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
  - This means x is to the left of z (because supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and x is above z (because supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

Ok, now I'm clear.

Now, given what we know, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. x is S of y means:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal extent is within y's)

2. y is NW of z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

From the second condition, we know that z is below y. And from the first condition, we know that x is also below y. So, both x and z are below y, but we don't know their vertical relation to each other.

From the conditions, we also know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x is S of y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y is NW of z)

Combining, we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Since x is to the left of z, the possible relations are:
- SW (if x is below z)
- W (if x and z have overlapping vertical extents)
- NW (if x is above z)

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, W, and NW.

Actually, I want to check one more thing to be sure. Let's look at S and NW:

- For a S b, we know supy(a) ≤ infy(b) and infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).
- For b NW c, we know supx(b) ≤ infx(c) and supy(c) ≤ infy(b).

Now, I want to see if we can deduce anything more about the relationship between a and c. We already know that a is to the left of c because supx(a) ≤ supx(b) ≤ infx(c).

Vertically, we know:
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) from a S b.
- supy(c) ≤ infy(b) from b NW c.

So, both a and c are below b, but we still don't know their vertical relationship with each other.

Ok, so in our specific case, the possible relations between region x and region z are still: SW, W, and NW.

Actually, let's analyze the problem from a different angle.

Given:
1. Region x is S of region y: x is below y and within y's horizontal extent.
2. Region y is NW of region z: y is to the left of z and above z.

Let's first figure out the horizontal relationship between x and z. 
From (1), we know that x is within y's horizontal extent (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).
From (2), we know that y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).
If supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

This means x is to the left of z.

Now, let's determine the possible vertical relationships between x and z.
From (1), we know that x is below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).
From (2), we know that y is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).

We know that both x and z are below y, but we can't directly determine the vertical relationship between x and z from the given information. Specifically:
- The maximum y-coordinate of x, supy(x), is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of y, infy(y).
- The maximum y-coordinate of z, supy(z), is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of y, infy(y).

These conditions don't tell us directly how the y-coordinates of x and z relate to each other.

Hence, there are multiple possibilities:
1. x could be below z (resulting in a SW relation).
2. x and z could have overlapping vertical extents (resulting in a W relation).
3. x could be above z (resulting in a NW relation).

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, W, and NW.

Let's sanity check this with an example:

Suppose y is the region defined by the box with corners at (1, 3) and (3, 5). Then:
- infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 5.

For x to be S of y, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(y) = 3, infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). 
One such x could be the box with corners at (1.5, 1) and (2.5, 2.5). For this x:
- infx(x) = 1.5, supx(x) = 2.5, infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 2.5.

For y to be NW of z, we need supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Let's consider a few possible positions for z:

1. If z is the box with corners at (4, 1) and (5, 2), then:
   - infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2.
   - Here, x is NW of z (because x is to the left of z and x is above z).

2. If z is the box with corners at (4, 1.5) and (5, 3), then:
   - infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 1.5, supy(z) = 3.
   - Here, x is W of z (because x is to the left of z and x and z have overlapping vertical extents).

3. If z is the box with corners at (4, 2.6) and (5, 3), then:
   - infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 2.6, supy(z) = 3.
   - Here, x is SW of z (because x is to the left of z and x is below z).

So, depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z (while still satisfying the given conditions), x can be NW, W, or SW of z.

Therefore, the answer is still: SW, W, and NW.

I haven't really considered the SE, B, E, NE, S, and N relations. Let me check if any of these are possible.

For SE, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). While it's possible that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This contradicts the requirement for SE, so x cannot be SE of z.

For B, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Again, the condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts the requirement for B, so x cannot be B of z.

For E, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), x is to the left of z, which contradicts the requirement for E. So, x cannot be E of z.

For NE, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Again, x is to the left of z, which contradicts the requirement for NE. So, x cannot be NE of z.

For S, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) cannot be satisfied. So, x cannot be S of z.

For N, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Again, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts the requirement for N.

I double checked the other relations and none of them are possible given the conditions. The only possible relations are SW, W, and NW, all of which have x to the left of z, which is consistent with our deduction.

Therefore, the answer is: SW, W, and NW.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, W, and NW.

When region x is S of region y:
- x is below y
- x is within y's horizontal extent

When region y is NW of region z:
- y is to the left of z
- y is above z

From these conditions:
1. Horizontally: Since x is within y's horizontal extent and y is to the left of z, x must be to the left of z.
2. Vertically: Both x and z are below y, but their vertical relationship with each other is undetermined.

Since x is definitely to the left of z, but can be below, overlapping vertically, or above z, the three possible relations are SW, W, and NW.
