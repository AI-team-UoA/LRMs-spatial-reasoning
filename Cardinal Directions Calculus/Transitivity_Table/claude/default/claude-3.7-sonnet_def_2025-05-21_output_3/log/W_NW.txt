PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step using the definitions of cardinal direction relations.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions for the relevant cardinal directions:

For "x is W of y":
x W y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

For "y is NW of z":
y NW z if and only if supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, let's try to deduce the possible relation between x and z.

From "x is W of y", we know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is above or at the same level as y's bottom)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is below or at the same level as y's top)

From "y is NW of z", we know:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
5. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relation between x and z:

For the x-coordinate:
From 1 and 4, we can derive: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This means: supx(x) <= infx(z)
This implies that x is to the left of z.

For the y-coordinate:
From 3 and 5, we can derive: supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

However, we can't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z) or supy(z) and infy(x) with the information given. This means x could be above, below, or at the same level as z.

Given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- W (if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))
- NW (if supy(z) <= infy(x))
- SW (if supy(x) <= infy(z))

Actually, let's check if we can further constrain the y-coordinate relation.

From 2 and 5, we can derive: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
This means: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
Hence, supy(z) <= infy(x)

This implies that x is above z, which means the relation must be NW.

Wait, let me double-check this reasoning.

From "x is W of y":
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is above or at the same level as y's bottom)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is below or at the same level as y's top)

From "y is NW of z":
4. supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
5. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

I made a mistake in my reasoning above. Let me correct it.

For the x-coordinate:
From 1 and 4, we can derive: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
This means: supx(x) <= infx(z)
This implies that x is to the left of z.

For the y-coordinate:
From 2 and 5, we can derive: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
This means: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
Hence, supy(z) <= infy(x)
This implies that x is above z.

From 3, we know: supy(x) <= supy(y)
But from 5, we know: supy(z) <= infy(y)
We can't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z) with the information given.

Hmm, let's take another approach. Given the constraints:
- x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z))
- x is above z (supy(z) <= infy(x))

This seems to indicate that x is NW of z. However, I want to make sure I'm not missing any other possibilities.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's approach it systematically.

From the definitions, if region a is related to region b with cardinal direction R, and region b is related to region c with cardinal direction S, then the possible relations between a and c can be determined by checking the compatibility of the constraints imposed by R and S.

Let's look at the compatible relations for "x W y" and "y NW z":

From "x W y":
- x is to the left of y
- x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range

From "y NW z":
- y is to the left of z
- y is above z

Given these constraints, x would be to the left of z (because x is to the left of y and y is to the left of z). However, the y-coordinate relationship between x and z depends on the specific positions of x, y, and z.

Let's consider different scenarios:

1. If x's y-coordinate range is entirely above z's y-coordinate range, then x would be NW of z.
2. If x's y-coordinate range overlaps with z's y-coordinate range, then x would be W of z.
3. If x's y-coordinate range is entirely below z's y-coordinate range, then x would be SW of z.

Since "x W y" means x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range, and "y NW z" means y is entirely above z, it appears that x must be above or at the same level as z. This rules out the possibility of x being SW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- W (if x's y-coordinate range overlaps with z's y-coordinate range)
- NW (if x's y-coordinate range is entirely above z's y-coordinate range)

Actually, I realize I may be overcomplicating this. Let's stare more at the constraints and think carefully about the y-coordinate.

From "x W y":
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is at or above y's bottom)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)

From "y NW z":
5. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom is above z's top)

From 2 and 5, we get: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
This implies supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is entirely above z.

With the x-coordinate constraint (x is to the left of z) and the y-coordinate constraint (x is above z), the relation between x and z is NW.

Wait, I think I'm again making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me restart and be more precise.

From the definitions:

For "x W y":
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-coordinate range is within y's y-coordinate range)

For "y NW z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

For the x-coordinate:
From "x W y" and "y NW z", we have: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
This implies: supx(x) <= infx(z)
Meaning: x is to the left of z.

For the y-coordinate:
From "x W y", we know: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
From "y NW z", we know: supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
This means: supy(z) <= infy(x)
Implying: x is above z.

However, we can't determine the exact relation between supy(x) and infy(z) with the information given.

So, if x is to the left of z and x is above z, the only possible cardinal direction relation is NW. I'm confident that NW is the answer.

Actually, let me stare at this one more time. Maybe I'm constraining it too tightly.

From "x W y" and "y NW z", we have:
- x is to the left of y
- y is to the left of z
- y is above z
- x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range

The constraints "x is to the left of y" and "y is to the left of z" together imply "x is to the left of z". This is because the x-coordinate of x < x-coordinate of y < x-coordinate of z.

The constraints "y is above z" and "x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range" together imply that x's bottom boundary is above y's bottom boundary, which is above z's top boundary. This means x is above z.

Given that x is to the left of z and x is above z, the cardinal direction relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let's think about it more conceptually.

If region x is to the west of region y, and region y is to the northwest of region z, then region x is to the northwest of region z. This is because:
1. West + Northwest (in the x-coordinate) = West (because both are to the left)
2. West + Northwest (in the y-coordinate) = Northwest (because y is above z, and x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range, so x is also above z)

But wait. Actually, I think I've been too restrictive. Let's reconsider.

From the cardinal direction definitions:
x W y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
y NW z if and only if supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (z is below x)

So, x is to the left and above z, which corresponds to the NW direction. But let's see if there's any other possibility.

Actually, wait. I made an mistake earlier. Let's re-interpret the conditions.

From "x W y":
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's bottom is at or below x's bottom)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)

From "y NW z":
4. supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
5. supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

From 1 and 4, we have: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This implies: supx(x) <= infx(z)
Meaning: x is to the left of z.

From 2 and 5, we have: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
This means: supy(z) <= infy(x)
Implying: z is below x.

Given these constraints, the relation between x and z is NW (x is to the left and above z).

Actually, I now see a subtle nuance. 

The condition "x W y" means x is to the west of y, which implies x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range. The condition "y NW z" means y is to the northwest of z, which implies y is to the left and above z.

When we combines these, x is definitely to the left of z. The y-coordinate relationship is a bit more complex. Since x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range and y is above z, it's possible that:
1. x is entirely above z (making the relation NW)
2. x and z have overlapping y-coordinates (making the relation W)

But let's check more closely. From "y NW z", we know:
supy(z) <= infy(y) (z's top is at or below y's bottom)

From "x W y", we know:
infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's bottom is at or below x's bottom)

Combining these, we get:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (z's top is at or below x's bottom)

This implies that z is entirely below x, making the relation between x and z definitely NW.

Actually, I need to be even more precise, since there might be a possibility I'm overlooking.

To reconsider, let's examine the conditions once more. I want to be absolutely sure about the y-coordinate relationship because that's where the potential ambiguity lies.

From "x W y" and "y NW z", we have the following constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is below x)

With these constraints, the relation between x and z is NW. There's no other cardinal direction relation that satisfies both of these constraints.

So, the answer is NW.

One more check, with formulas. From "x W y", we know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y NW z", we know:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z)
5. supy(z) <= infy(y)

Are there any other constraints I'm missing? Let's see... no I think 1-5 are complete.

From 1 and 4, we can derive: supx(x) <= infx(z)
This ensures that x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)).

From 2 and 5, we can derive: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) => supy(z) <= infy(x)
This ensures that x is above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)).

Given these constraints, the relation between x and z is NW (to the left and above).

I am absolutely confident that the answer is NW.

Wait, let me try to think about this problem from a different angle, i.e. by considering concrete configurations that respect the constraints. I will pick specific regions and see the relation between them.

Let's define three regions x, y, and z on a Cartesian plane.

For simplicity, let's consider rectangular regions.

Case 1: let's say 
x = [1, 2] x [5, 7]
y = [3, 4] x [4, 8]
z = [5, 6] x [1, 3]

Here x W y because:
- supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3
- infy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5
- supy(x) = 7 <= supy(y) = 8

And y NW z because:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5
- supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 4

In this configuration, the relation between x and z is:
- supx(x) = 2 <= infx(z) = 5 (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) = 5 (z is below x)

So, the relation is NW.

Case 2: let's try a slightly different configuration.
x = [1, 2] x [3, 4]
y = [3, 4] x [2, 5]
z = [5, 6] x [0, 1]

Here x W y because:
- supx(x) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3
- infy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 3
- supy(x) = 4 <= supy(y) = 5

And y NW z because:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(y) = 2

In this configuration, the relation between x and z is:
- supx(x) = 2 <= infx(z) = 5 (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 3 (z is below x)

Again, the relation is NW.

Are there any other possible configurations I might want to check?
I think one place I might be wrong is in the statement "if y is above z and x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range, then x is above z." Let me revisit this.

If y is above z, then supy(z) <= infy(y). If x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range, then infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). Given these, we can derive supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This implies x is above z. 

So my initial logic is correct.

I'm pretty confident that the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Hold on, let's revisit the problem once more to ensure I have not missed out any possiblity.

Given:
- x W y: x is to the west of y
- y NW z: y is to the northwest of z

We want to find the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z.

From "x W y", we can derive:
1. x is to the left of y
2. x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range

From "y NW z", we can derive:
3. y is to the left of z
4. y is above z

From 1 and 3, we can conclude that x is to the left of z (because of transitivity in the x-coordinate).

Now, for the y-coordinate, from 2 and 4, we know that x's y-coordinate range is contained within y's y-coordinate range, and y is above z. While I'm confident based on my derivation above that x should be above z, let me double-check.

If "x W y", then infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's bottom is at or below x's bottom). If "y NW z", then supy(z) <= infy(y) (z's top is at or below y's bottom). Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x) (z's top is at or below x's bottom).

This means z is below x. Since x is to the left of z and z is below x, the relation between x and z is NW.

So, based on the constraints given, the answer is:
x NW z

But let me make sure, by really re-checking carefully.

From "x W y":
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's bottom is at or below x's bottom)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)

From "y NW z":
4. supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
5. supy(z) <= infy(y) (z's top is at or below y's bottom)

From 1 and 4, we can derive: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) => supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z).

From 2 and 5, we can derive: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) => supy(z) <= infy(x) (z's top is at or below x's bottom). This means z is below x.

I'm convinced this is the only interpretation that matches our constraints.

Given that x is to the left of z and z is below x, the relation between x and z is:
x NW z

I am now fully confident that the answer is NW.

Actually, I want to try visualizing a concrete case. Let me do that one more time.

Let's imagine a coordinate system. 

For region y, say it has a boundary from (5,5) to (10,10). That is, infx(y) = 5, supx(y) = 10, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 10. So y is a square from (5,5) to (10,10).

For region z, say it has a boundary from (11, 0) to (15, 4). That is, infx(z) = 11, supx(z) = 15, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 4.

So we have supx(y) <= infx(z) because 10 <= 11, and we have supy(z) <= infy(y) because 4 <= 5. So y NW z.

For region x, we need it to be W of y. Where could it be? Let's try a region from (0, 6) to (4, 9). That is, infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 9. Given that supx(x) <= infx(y) (we have 4 <= 5), infy(y) <= infy(x) (we have 5 <= 6), and supy(x) <= supy(y) (we have 9 <= 10), so indeed x W y.

Now let's see the relation between x and z. We know infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 9, infx(z) = 11, supx(z) = 15, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 4. 

So we have 
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (4 <= 11), meaning x is to the left of z
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (4 <= 6), meaning z is below x
This corresponds to NW.

So yes, indeed x is NW of z. I remain convinced that NW is the unique answer.

Actually, let's try a different configuration or two. I wnat to see if I can find a example where the answer is something other than NW!

In the previous example, y was rectangle, not a region homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. That's fine, I will try again.

For region y, say it has infx(y) = 5, supx(y) = 10, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 10. So the minimum bounding box of y is from (5,5) to (10,10), but the actual region could be some roundish shape inside that box, e.g. a quarter circle of radius 5 centered at the 10,10.

For region z, say it has infx(z) = 11, supx(z) = 15, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 4. So the minimum bounding box of z is from (11, 0) to (15, 4). Again, the region could be some roundish shape inside that box.

The constraint that "y NW z" means: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y). Indeed, supx(y) = 10 <= infx(z) = 11, and supy(z) = 4 <= infy(y) = 5, satisfying "y NW z".

For region x, the constraint "x W y" means: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).

Let me pick different boxes for x and see if I can get a different relation to z:

Example 1: x with infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 9.
We have supx(x) = 4 <= infx(y) = 5, infy(y) = 5 <= infy(x) = 6, and supy(x) = 9 <= supy(y) = 10. So, indeed, "x W y".

Now, the relation between x and z:
We have supx(x) = 4 <= infx(z) = 11 (x is to the left of z) and supy(z) = 4 <= infy(x) = 6 (z is below x). That's a "NW" relation.

Example 2: x with infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 8.
We have supx(x) = 4 <= infx(y) = 5, infy(y) = 5 = infy(x) = 5, and supy(x) = 8 <= supy(y) = 10. So, "x W y" still holds.

The relation between x and z:
We have supx(x) = 4 <= infx(z) = 11 (x is to the left of z) and supy(z) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 (z is below x). That's still a "NW" relation.

I'm still getting NW for the relation between x and z, regardless of the specifics of the regions, as long as they satisfy the given constraints.

In general terms, 
- "x W y" means x is to the left of y and x's y-coodrinates of x are contained in the y-coordinates of y (in the specific sense I described from the definition earlier)
- "y NW z" means y is to the left of z and z is below y.

The only constraint this imposes on the relation between x and z is:
- x is to the left of z (because x is to the left of y and y is to the left of z)
- z is below x (because z is below y and x is vertically aligned with y)

This unique combination places x in the NW of z.

Ok, I'm convinced that the correct answer is "NW".

Wait a minute! I just realized that I might have misinterpreted one of the constraints. Let me double-check the definition.

From the definition of "x W y", it says:

x W y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means:
1. x is to the left of y.
2. y's bottom is at or below x's bottom.
3. x's top is at or below y's top.

In other words, x's y-range doesn't have to be entirely contained within y's y-range. It just needs to be such that y's bottom is at or below x's bottom, and x's top is at or below y's top.

Given that, I need to reconsider all possible configurations.

From "x W y", we know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's bottom is at or below x's bottom)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)

From "y NW z", we know:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
5. supy(z) <= infy(y) (z's top is at or below y's bottom)

From 1 and 4, we can derive: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) => supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z).

From 2 and 5, we can derive: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) => supy(z) <= infy(x) (z's top is at or below x's bottom). This means z is below x.

I think I'm still right. Given that x is to the left of z and z is below x, the relation between x and z is:
x NW z

I don't see any other possibility with the given constraints.

Actually, let me think about the y-coordinate more. Maybe I can come up with a configuration where there's a different relation.

From "x W y", we know y's bottom is at or below x's bottom, and x's top is at or below y's top.
From "y NW z", we know z's top is at or below y's bottom.

If z's top is at or below y's bottom, and y's bottom is at or below x's bottom, then z's top is at or below x's bottom. This means z is below x.

So, given the constraints, the relation between x and z is still NW.

Ok, so our answer is NW. But let me ask: are there other possible answers that aren't NW?

For the relation to be something other than NW, we would need one of the following:
1. x is not to the left of z: This contradicts our derivation from "x W y" and "y NW z".
2. z is not below x: This contradicts our derivation from "x W y" and "y NW z".

So, it doesn't seem possible to have a relation other than NW.

Actually, wait a minute!

Let's try again. I will visualize a different example of regions.

For region y, say it has infx(y) = 5, supx(y) = 10, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 10.
For region z, say it has infx(z) = 11, supx(z) = 16, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 4.

The constraint "y NW z" is satisfied: supx(y) = 10 <= infx(z) = 11, and supy(z) = 4 <= infy(y) = 5.

For region x, let's try: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 9.

The constraint "x W y" is satisfied: supx(x) = 4 <= infx(y) = 5, infy(y) = 5 <= infy(x) = 6, and supy(x) = 9 <= supy(y) = 10.

The relation between x and z:
We have supx(x) = 4 <= infx(z) = 11 (x is to the left of z) and supy(z) = 4 <= infy(x) = 6 (z is below x). That's a "NW" relation.

But let me actually try to challenge the conclusion and find a case where x is not NW of z.

So, suppose x is not NW of z. This would mean either:
a. x is not to the left of z (i.e., supx(x) > infx(z)), or
b. z is not below x (i.e., supy(z) > infy(x)).

Let's check if (a) is possible. From "x W y", we have supx(x) <= infx(y), and from "y NW z", we have supx(y) <= infx(z). Since infx(y) <= supx(y) (by definition of infimum and supremum), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This gives us supx(x) <= infx(z), contradicting (a). So, (a) is not possible, which means x must be to the left of z.

Let's check if (b) is possible. From "x W y", we have infy(y) <= infy(x), and from "y NW z", we have supy(z) <= infy(y). Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts (b). So, (b) is not possible, which means z must be below x.

So given the constraints, x is always to the left of z and z is always below x, which means the relation is always NW. Huh, let me think…

Actually, let's recall the definitions of the cardinal directions:

NW: a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

That is, a is NW of b if a is to the left of b and b is below a.

Given our derivation that x is to the left of z and z is below x, the cardinal direction relation between x and z is:
x NW z

I'm absolutely confident in this.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z is only NW.

Thinking logically, imagine a birds-eye view. The region x is to the west of region y (W). And y is to the northwest of region z (NW). So, z is southeast of y, and y is east of x. Combining these, x is to the northwest of z (NW).

Or to paraphrase, given "x W y" and "y NW z", the only possible relation between x and z is "x NW z".

Ok, I'm pretty confident.

Actually, I'm wondering if I'm missing anything. Let me really check if I'm representing the definitions correctly.

For "x W y":
x W y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means:
1. x is to the left of y.
2. y's bottom is at or below x's bottom.
3. x's top is at or below y's top.

For "y NW z":
y NW z if and only if supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

This means:
4. y is to the left of z.
5. z's top is at or below y's bottom.

From these, we can derive:
- From 1 and 4: x is to the left of z.
- From 2 and 5: z's top is at or below x's bottom, which means z is below x.

Given that x is to the left of z and z is below x, the cardinal direction relation between x and z is "x NW z".

I think that's all the inference we can make. In summary, the answer is:
x NW z

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction definitions, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From "x W y", we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top boundary is at or below y's top boundary)

From "y NW z", we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

Analyzing the x-coordinate relationship:
From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can derive supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Analyzing the y-coordinate relationship:
From infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), we can derive supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is below x.

Since x is to the left of z and z is below x, the only possible relation is:

NW
