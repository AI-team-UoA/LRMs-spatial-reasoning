PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This problem is about deducing possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z.

Let's use the definitions provided:
- x SW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y N z means supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

I need to determine what these constraints tell us about the possible relations between x and z.

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [x is to the west of y]
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  [x is to the south of y]

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  [y is to the north of z]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [z extends at least as far west as y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  [z extends at least as far east as y]

Now, let's see what we can deduce about x relative to z:

For the east-west relationship:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [from x SW y]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [from y N z]

Since we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), we cannot definitively conclude any east-west relationship between x and z. x could be west of z, could overlap with z in the east-west direction, or could be east of z, depending on the specific positions.

For the north-south relationship:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  [from x SW y]
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  [from y N z]

From these, we can see that both x and z are south of y. However, we cannot determine the north-south relationship between x and z. x could be north of z, south of z, or at the same level.

Given these constraints, what could be the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z?

Let's analyze each possible cardinal direction relation:

1. x N z (North):
   This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y). This means both x and z are south of y, but we can't determine their relative positions. So x could be N of z.

2. x NE z (Northeast):
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) from x SW y, so x is west of y. We also know from y N z that supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means z extends at least as far east as y. Given these constraints, it's unlikely that x is east of z (because x is west of y and z extends eastward from y). So x NE z seems unlikely.

Actually, wait, I need to be more precise here. From our given constraints, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [from x SW y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  [from y N z]

This doesn't tell us definitively about the east-west relationship between x and z. It's possible that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which would mean x is west of z. But it's also possible that infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(z), which would mean x and z overlap in the east-west direction.

Let's reconsider. From:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [from x SW y]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [from y N z]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  [from y N z]

We can see that infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y), which means infx(z) and supx(x) are both ≤ infx(y). But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(z) and supx(x). It's possible that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which would mean x is west of z. But it's also possible that infx(z) ≤ supx(x), which would mean x and z overlap or x is east of z (though the latter seems unlikely given the other constraints).

For the north-south relationship, from:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  [from x SW y]
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  [from y N z]

We know both x and z are south of y. But the relative north-south positioning of x and z is not constrained by the given relations. x could be north of z, at the same level, or south of z.

Given this more detailed analysis, let's reconsider the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

0. Let's define our constraints more clearly:
   a. supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [x is west of y]
   b. supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  [x is south of y]
   c. supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  [y is north of z]
   d. infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [z extends at least as far west as y]
   e. supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  [z extends at least as far east as y]

1. x N z:
   This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   Given our constraints, this is possible if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which is not constrained by our given relations).

2. x NE z:
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   Given our constraints, this is not possible because supx(z) ≥ supx(y) (from e) and infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from a). This means supx(z) ≥ supx(y) ≥ infx(y) ≥ infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

3. x E z:
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   Given our constraints, this is not possible for the same reason as NE.

4. x SE z:
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   Given our constraints, this is not possible for the same reason as NE.

5. x S z:
   This requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   Given our constraints, this is possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which is not constrained by our given relations).

6. x SW z:
   This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   Given our constraints, this is possible if infx(z) ≥ supx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which are not directly constrained by our given relations). Since x is SW of y and y is N of z, it's plausible that x could be SW of z.

7. x W z:
   This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   Given our constraints, this is possible if infx(z) ≥ supx(x) (which is not directly constrained by our given relations).

8. x NW z:
   This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   Given our constraints, this is possible if infx(z) ≥ supx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which are not directly constrained by our given relations).

9. x B z:
   This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   Given our constraints, this is possible if the above conditions are met (which are not directly constrained by our given relations).

Based on the above analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be: N, S, SW, W, NW, and B. The relations NE, E, and SE are not possible.

Actually, I think I made an error in my analysis for x N z. Let me double-check.

For x N z, the conditions are:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)  [x is north of z]
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x)  [z extends at least as far west as x]
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)  [z extends at least as far east as x]

From our constraints, we know:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [x is west of y]
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [z extends at least as far west as y]
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  [z extends at least as far east as y]

The condition supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is likely to be met since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
The condition infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not directly constrained by our given relations. It could be true or false.

So, x N z is possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) are both true, which is not constrained by our given relations. Now I need to double-check all the other relations...

Actually, let me use a more systematic approach. Let's go back to the initial constraints:
   a. supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [x is west of y]
   b. supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  [x is south of y]
   c. supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  [y is north of z]
   d. infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [z extends at least as far west as y]
   e. supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  [z extends at least as far east as y]

Let's analyze the possible east-west relationships between x and z:
- From a, we know x is west of y.
- From d and e, we know z overlaps with y in the east-west direction and extends eastward beyond y.
- Given this, x could be west of z, or could overlap with z in the east-west direction.

Let's analyze the possible north-south relationships between x and z:
- From b, we know x is south of y.
- From c, we know z is south of y.
- Given this, x could be north of z, at the same level as z, or south of z.

Combining the possible east-west and north-south relationships, we can determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. If x is west of z and north of z, then x NW z.
2. If x is west of z and at the same level as z, then x W z.
3. If x is west of z and south of z, then x SW z.
4. If x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is north of z, then x N z.
5. If x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is at the same level as z, then x B z (assuming x is fully contained within z).
6. If x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is south of z, then x S z.

I don't think x can be east of z because x is west of y (from a) and z overlaps with y in the east-west direction (from d and e). So, the relations NE, E, and SE are unlikely.

But wait, actually I need to be careful here. x overlapping with z in the east-west direction doesn't necessarily mean x is bounding box with z. x would need to be fully contained within z for that. Otherwise, x could be N, S, etc., of z even if they overlap in the east-west direction.

Let me review the east-west relationship more carefully:
- From a, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
- From d, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y).
- From e, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y), then x and z overlap in the east-west direction, with x being partially to the east of z.
If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(y), then x is west of z.

For the north-south relationship, we know:
- From b, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- From c, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y), then x is north of z.
If infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), then x and z overlap in the north-south direction.
If infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y), then z is fully contained within x in the north-south direction.
If supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(y), then x is south of z.

OK, let me enumerate the possible east-west and north-south relationships, and then combine them for the cardinal direction relations:

East-West relationships: x could be west of z or overlap with z in the east-west direction.
North-South relationships: x could be north of z, overlap with z in the north-south direction, or be south of z.

So, the possible combined relationships are:
1. x is west of z and north of z => x NW z.
2. x is west of z and overlaps with z in the north-south direction => x W z.
3. x is west of z and south of z => x SW z.
4. x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is north of z => x N z.
5. x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and overlaps with z in the north-south direction => x could be B z (if x is fully contained within z), or x and z could have a more complex relationship. In this case, let's say the relationship is one of the cardinal directions: N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW, or B.
6. x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is south of z => x S z.

Actually, I've been a bit sloppy in my analysis. Let me be more precise about the possible relationships:

East-West relationships:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(z) => x is west of z.
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) => x overlaps with z in the east-west direction, with x being in the western part of z.
3. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x) => x overlaps with z in the east-west direction, with x extending eastward beyond z.

Given our constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [x is west of y]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [z extends at least as far west as y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  [z extends at least as far east as y]

It's possible that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which would mean x is west of z (Relationship 1).
It's also possible that infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y), which means x and z overlap in the east-west direction, with x being in the western part of z (Relationship 2).
The third east-west relationship seems unlikely given our constraints, as it would require supx(z) ≤ supx(x), but we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

North-South relationships:
1. supy(z) ≤ infy(x) => x is north of z.
2. infy(x) ≤ supy(z) and infy(z) ≤ supy(x) => x and z overlap in the north-south direction.
3. supy(x) ≤ infy(z) => x is south of z.

Given our constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  [x is south of y]
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  [y is north of z]

All three north-south relationships are possible because the relative positions of x and z in the north-south direction are not constrained by our given relations.

Combining the possible east-west and north-south relationships, we get:

1. x is west of z and north of z => x NW z.
2. x is west of z and overlaps with z in the north-south direction => x W z.
3. x is west of z and south of z => x SW z.
4. x overlaps with z in the east-west direction (with x being in the western part of z) and is north of z => x N z.
5. x overlaps with z in the east-west direction (with x being in the western part of z) and overlaps with z in the north-south direction => This could be a complex relationship. If x is fully contained within z, then x B z. Otherwise, it's one of the other cardinal directions or a multi-tile relation.
6. x overlaps with z in the east-west direction (with x being in the western part of z) and is south of z => x S z.

Given our constraints and the possible combinations of east-west and north-south relationships, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be: N, S, SW, W, NW, and potentially B if certain conditions are met.

Actually, let's clarify the condition for x B z. For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given our constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so the condition supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied.
- Both infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) are not constrained by our given relations. It's possible that all of them are satisfied, making x B z possible.

Now, although I've mentioned that x B z is possible if certain conditions are met, it's actually the bounding box (B) scenario I described in situation 5, where x overlaps with z in both east-west and north-south directions. If x is fully contained within z, then the relationship is x B z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be: N, S, SW, W, NW, and B.

Actually, let me double-check the condition for x B z. I think I initially misstated the definition. For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

This means x is fully contained within z. Given our constraints, it's possible that all of these conditions are satisfied, making x B z a possible relation.

Actually, wait, sometimes I get confused by the definitions because I'm trying to determine the relation of x with respect to z (i.e., x R z), but the definitions are provided for a relation with respect to b (i.e., a R b). Let me just directly substitute:

For x B z, the conditions are:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

For x S z, the conditions are:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For x SW z, the conditions are:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

For x W z, the conditions are:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

For x NW z, the conditions are:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

For x N z, the conditions are:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For x NE z, the conditions are:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

For x E z, the conditions are:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

For x SE z, the conditions are:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Given the constraints discussed, namely:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  [x is west of y]
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  [x is south of y]
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  [y is north of z]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  [z extends at least as far west as y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  [z extends at least as far east as y]

Let's analyze the possibility of each cardinal direction relation:

1. x B z:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x): Not constrained by given relations.
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z): From the given relations, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so this condition is satisfied.
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x): Not constrained by given relations.
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z): Not constrained by given relations.
   - Possible if the unconstrained conditions are met.

2. x S z:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z): Not constrained by given relations.
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x): Not constrained by given relations.
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z): From the given relations, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so this condition is satisfied.
   - Possible if the unconstrained conditions are met.

3. x SW z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z): From the given relations, supx(x) ≤ infx(y). But we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(y). Thus, it's not certain that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). It could be, making this relation possible.
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z): Not constrained by given relations.
   - Possible if the unconstrained conditions are met.

4. x W z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z): Same consideration as in SW.
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x): Not constrained by given relations.
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z): Not constrained by given relations.
   - Possible if the unconstrained conditions are met.

5. x NW z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z): Same consideration as in SW.
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x): Not constrained by given relations.
   - Possible if the unconstrained conditions are met.

6. x N z:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x): Not constrained by given relations.
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x): Not constrained by given relations.
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z): From the given relations, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so this condition is satisfied.
   - Possible if the unconstrained conditions are met.

7. x NE z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x): From the given relations, supx(z) ≥ supx(y) ≥ infx(y) ≥ infx(x). This contradicts the required condition. So, this relation is not possible.

8. x E z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x): Same contradiction as in NE. Not possible.

9. x SE z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x): Same contradiction as in NE. Not possible.

From the above analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be: B, S, SW, W, NW, and N. The relations NE, E, and SE are not possible.

Actually, I've made an error. I was thinking of a scenario where x is in the bounding box of z. But the given definitions in the problem statement don't match that. Here's the correct definition:

For region a and reference region b:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means a is fully contained within the bounding box of b. So, for x B z, it means x is fully contained within the bounding box of z.

Ok, so I should be determining whether x is in the relation R with respect to reference region z (x R z), not the other way around. Let's continue with this understanding using the definitions given in the problem statement:

1. x B z (x is in the bounding box of z):
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - Given our constraints, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied. The other conditions are not constrained.
   - Possible if all the unconstrained conditions are met.

2. x S z (x is to the south of z):
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x is in the east-west extent of z)
   - Given our constraints, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied. The other conditions are not constrained.
   - Possible if all the unconstrained conditions are met.

3. x SW z (x is to the southwest of z):
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
   - Given our constraints, these conditions are not directly constrained. However, there's an indirect relation: we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), so if infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But if infx(z) < infx(y), then we can't determine for sure.
   - Possible if all the conditions are met.

4. x W z (x is to the west of z):
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x is in the north-south extent of z)
   - Similar reasoning as for SW. Possible if all the conditions are met.

5. x NW z (x is to the northwest of z):
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
   - Similar reasoning as for SW. Possible if all the conditions are met.

6. x N z (x is to the north of z):
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x is in the east-west extent of z)
   - Given our constraints, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied. The other conditions are not constrained.
   - Possible if all the unconstrained conditions are met.

7. x NE z (x is to the northeast of z):
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
   - Given our constraints, supx(z) ≥ supx(y) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Not possible.

8. x E z (x is to the east of z):
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x is in the north-south extent of z)
   - Same contradiction as in NE. Not possible.

9. x SE z (x is to the southeast of z):
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
   - Same contradiction as in NE. Not possible.

From the above, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: B, S, SW, W, NW, and N. The relations NE, E, and SE are not possible.

Actually let's follow the diagram given in figure 1 of the PDF to make sure I get the definitions right. The diagram clearly shows that for a S b, region a is in the south tile with respect to reference region b. And similarly for other directions. So let me try once more:

1. x B z: x is in the bounding box tile of z.
2. x S z: x is in the south tile of z.
3. x SW z: x is in the southwest tile of z.
4. x W z: x is in the west tile of z.
5. x NW z: x is in the northwest tile of z.
6. x N z: x is in the north tile of z.
7. x NE z: x is in the northeast tile of z.
8. x E z: x is in the east tile of z.
9. x SE z: x is in the southeast tile of z.

And for a given tile, the conditions are:

1. B tile: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
2. S tile: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

Given the constraints:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Let's analyze the possibility of each relation between x and z:

1. x B z:
   - Need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied.
   - The other conditions are not directly constrained by the given relations.
   - Possible if the unconstrained conditions are met.

2. x S z:
   - Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied.
   - The other conditions are not directly constrained by the given relations.
   - Possible if the unconstrained conditions are met.

3. x SW z:
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). If infx(z) < infx(y), we can't determine whether supx(x) ≤ infx(z). If infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is not directly constrained by the given relations.
   - Possible if all the conditions are met.

4. x W z:
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - Similar reasoning as for SW for the east-west condition.
   - The north-south conditions are not directly constrained by the given relations.
   - Possible if all the conditions are met.

5. x NW z:
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - Similar reasoning as for SW for the east-west condition.
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then this condition is satisfied.
   - Possible if all the conditions are met.

6. x N z:
   - Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied.
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then this condition is satisfied.
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not directly constrained by the given relations.
   - Possible if all the unconstrained conditions are met.

7. x NE z:
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This contradicts the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Not possible.

8. x E z:
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - Same contradiction as in NE for the east-west condition.
   - Not possible.

9. x SE z:
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - Same contradiction as in NE for the east-west condition.
   - Not possible.

From the above, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: B, S, SW, W, NW, and N. The relations NE, E, and SE are not possible.

Actually, there's something about the B relation I'm still confused about. The definition for a B b says:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means a is fully contained within (or on the border of) the bounding box of b.

But from the question, B is described as:
A single-tile cardinal direction relation B (bounding box), S (South), SW (South West), W (West), NW (North West), N (North), NE (North East), E (East) and SE (South East) is defined as follows:

So, based on the name "bounding box", it seems like B is indicating that a is inside the bounding box of b. 

Actually I think the naming is from the perspective of the 9-tile partition: B represents the central tile, which corresponds to the bounding box of the reference region.

Anyways, I think my final analysis looks correct, so let's summarize:

Given that x is SW of y and y is N of z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: B, S, SW, W, NW, and N. The relations NE, E, and SE are not possible.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine what relations are possible between regions x and z given that x is SW of y and y is N of z.

Let's analyze what we know:
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

For each possible relation between x and z, I'll check if it's consistent with these constraints:

NE, E, SE: These are impossible because we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts the requirement that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for any eastern relation.

For the remaining relations:

B: Possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

S: Possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

SW: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

W: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

NW: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

N: Possible if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

The possible relations between x and z are: B, S, SW, W, NW, N
