PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

In this problem, I need to determine possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that region x is S (South) of region y, and region y is B (bounding box) of region z.

First, let me understand what these relations mean:
- x S y means that x is south of y. Specifically: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y B z means that y is the bounding box of z. Specifically: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now I need to deduce what relations are possible between x and z.

Since x is S of y, we know that x is completely below y (on the y-axis). Also, x's x-projection is within y's x-projection.

Since y is B of z, we know that z is contained within y's bounding box.

Let's think about the possible configurations:

1. Region z could be entirely within region y, possibly touching its boundary.
2. Region z could extend beyond region y in any direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW), as long as its bounding box matches y's.

Now, I need to determine where x could be relative to z:

Given that x is S of y, and y is B of z, there are several possibilities:

1. x could be S of z: This happens if z is entirely in the northern part of y or occupies most of y but doesn't extend to its southern boundary.

2. x could be SE of z: This is possible if z is positioned in the northwestern part of y.

3. x could be SW of z: This is possible if z is positioned in the northeastern part of y.

4. x could be B of z: This is possible if z is contained entirely within x (and y).

5. x could be E of z: If z is in the western part of y, extending from north to south, but not reaching the eastern boundary of y.

6. x could be W of z: If z is in the eastern part of y, extending from north to south, but not reaching the western boundary of y.

Wait, let me think more carefully about these possibilities.

Given that x is S of y, we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's)

Given that y is B of z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's)

Let's work out what these constraints tell us about the relation between x and z.

First, considering the y-axis:
- We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- We also know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's y-projection starts at or before y's)

This means z's y-projection could start before x ends on the y-axis, or it could start after x ends. So on the y-axis, x and z could be separated (x below z), or they could overlap.

Now considering the x-axis:
- We know infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's)
- We also know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's)

This means z's x-projection contains y's, which contains x's. So on the x-axis, z's projection definitely contains x's.

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. If infy(z) > supy(x), then x is completely below z, so x S z (x is south of z).

2. If infy(z) ≤ supy(x) and infx(z) < infx(x), then x and z overlap in the y-direction, and z extends to the left of x. This could result in x being B z (if z is completely within x), or x SE z (if z is to the northwest of x), or x E z (if z is to the west of x).

3. If infy(z) ≤ supy(x) and supx(z) > supx(x), then x and z overlap in the y-direction, and z extends to the right of x. This could result in x being B z (if z is completely within x), or x SW z (if z is to the northeast of x), or x W z (if z is to the east of x).

Actually, let me approach this differently.

Given the constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

I'll consider all the defined cardinal directions and check which ones are possible for the relation between x and z.

1. x B z: This means infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   
   Given our constraints, we don't know for sure how infx(x) relates to infx(z), how supx(x) relates to supx(z), how infy(x) relates to infy(z), or how supy(x) relates to supy(z).
   
   So x B z is possible only if these conditions hold. But it's not necessarily always true.

2. x S z: This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   
   Given supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), we can't guarantee that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). It depends on whether z extends to the bottom of y or not.
   
   If infy(z) >= infy(y), then supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), so x S z.
   
   But if infy(z) < infy(y), then we don't know if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   
   Similarly, given infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), we get infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   
   And given supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   
   So x S z is possible if z doesn't extend too far south.

3. x SW z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   
   Given supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), we can't guarantee that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Similarly, we can't guarantee that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   
   So x SW z is possible only if these conditions hold, but it's not necessarily always true.

Hmm, actually this is a bit tricky. Let me think about this differently.

Given that x is South of y, x is entirely below y, and x's x-projection is within y's.

Given that y is the bounding box of z, z is contained within y, but could touch y's boundary.

Let's think about where z could be relative to y:
- z could be at the northern part of y, possibly touching its upper boundary.
- z could be at the southern part of y, possibly touching its lower boundary.
- z could be at the western part of y, possibly touching its left boundary.
- z could be at the eastern part of y, possibly touching its right boundary.
- z could be at any corner of y, possibly touching both boundaries at that corner.
- z could be entirely contained within y without touching any boundary.

Now, given that x is South of y, and z is contained within y, let's see where x could be relative to z:

If z is at the northern part of y, not reaching its lower boundary, then x is south of z (x S z).

If z is at the southern part of y, touching its lower boundary, then x could be:
- x S z (if z doesn't extend all the way to the lower boundary of y)
- x SE z (if z is at the southwest corner of y, and doesn't extend to the southeast)
- x SW z (if z is at the southeast corner of y, and doesn't extend to the southwest)
- x W z (if z is at the right boundary of y's southern part, and doesn't extend to the left)
- x E z (if z is at the left boundary of y's southern part, and doesn't extend to the right)

Actually, wait, let me approach this differently.

Given that y is B of z, the only real constraint is that z is contained within y. It's not that y is contained within z as I initially thought.

So, given that x is S of y, and z is contained within y:

1. If z is in the northern part of y and doesn't extend to its lower boundary, then x is south of z (x S z).

2. If z is in the northwestern part of y and doesn't extend to its lower or right boundaries, then x is southeast of z (x SE z).

3. If z is in the northeastern part of y and doesn't extend to its lower or left boundaries, then x is southwest of z (x SW z).

4. If z is in the western part of y and doesn't extend to its right boundary, and if x and z overlap in the y-direction, then x is east of z (x E z).

5. If z is in the eastern part of y and doesn't extend to its left boundary, and if x and z overlap in the y-direction, then x is west of z (x W z).

Actually, wait, I misidenterpretted the constraint.

Let's clarify the constraint "y B z" again:

y B z means that y is B (bounding box) of z, which is defined as:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means that y's projection in both x and y axes is contained within z's projection. So, z's projection extends beyond y's in all directions (or is equal). In other words, z can extend beyond the boundaries of y in all directions.

Now, given that x is S of y, we have:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

Ok, actually I think I've been making an error in how I understand "y B z".

y B z means:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means that y's bounding box is entirely within or equal to z's bounding box. In other words, z's projection can extend beyond or be equal to y's in all directions.

And x S y means:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

This means x is entirely below y, and x's x-projection is contained within y's.

Ok, so let's go with this and figure out the possible relations between x and z.

1. x S z:
   For this, we need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   
   We know: 
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) from x S y
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) from y B z
   From these, we can't definitely say that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). If infy(z) < supy(x) < infy(y), then x is not S of z.
   
   We also know:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) from x S y
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) from y B z
   From these, we can say that infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   
   And:
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) from x S y
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) from y B z
   From these, we can say that supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   
   So, for x to be S of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This is possible if z doesn't extend too far south of y.

Similarly, I can check all other possible relations and determine which ones are compatible with our constraints.

I realize that I still don't have a systematic approach here. Let me try again.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this.

Given that:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's)

I can derive:
1. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (z's left boundary is to the left of or coincides with x's)
2. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z's right boundary is to the right of or coincides with x's)
3. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's bottom can be below y's)
4. supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z's top is above or coincides with y's)

Given these, and the fact that supy(x) ≤ infy(y), I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's check each of the 9 cardinal direction relations and see if they're possible:

1. x B z:
   This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   
   From our derivations, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) doesn't always hold. It depends on the specific configurations of x, y, and z. So, x B z is not guaranteed.

Actually I've been making an error all along the. Let's try this again.

"y B z" means y is B of z, which means:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means that y completely contains z. y is the bounding box of z.

And "x S y" means:
supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)

This means x is South of y, and x's x-projection is within y's.

Let's derive what we can:
1. infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)
2. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)... wait, this isn't right. If y is B of z, then y contains z, so it would be infx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(y).

Let's re-read the definitions to make sure:

x S y means: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
This means that x is South of y. x's vertical projection is completely below y's vertical projection. And x's horizontal projection is contained within y's horizontal projection.

y B z means: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
This means... hmm, but this is contradictory to my understanding of "y is the bounding box of z". If y is the bounding box of z, then y contains z, not the other way around.

Looking at the definition again:
"a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)"

So, "y B z" means:
infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means that z's bounding box contains y's bounding box. z's projection in both axes extends beyond (or is equal to) y's.

OK, this makes more sense. So z's bounding box contains y's bounding box, and x is South of y.

Now, let's reconsider our derivations:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)
3. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

From these, we can derive:
a. infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (z's projection on x-axis starts before x's)
b. supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (z's projection on x-axis extends beyond x's)
c. infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's projection on y-axis starts before y's)
d. supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's projection on y-axis extends beyond y's)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. x S z (x is South of z):
   This requires: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   
   From our derivations, we know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   For supy(x) <= infy(z), we know supy(x) <= infy(y) from "x S y", but we also know infy(z) <= infy(y) from "y B z". So supy(x) <= infy(z) might not always hold.
   
   If z doesn't extend too far south (i.e., infy(z) = infy(y)), then supy(x) <= infy(z) and x S z holds.

2. x SW z (x is Southwest of z):
   This requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   From our derivations, we know supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). But we don't know if supx(x) <= infx(z).
   For supy(x) <= infy(z), as discussed above, it depends on how far south z extends.
   
   If z is positioned in the northeastern part of y and doesn't extend too far south, then x SW z is possible.

3. x W z (x is West of z):
   This requires: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   From our derivations, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). It's not guaranteed that infy(z) <= infy(x) or that supx(x) <= infx(z).
   
   However, if z is positioned at the east of y and x overlaps with z in the y-direction, then x W z is possible.

Actually I don't think I'm making any progress. Let me try to systematically check each of the 9 possible cardinal directions.

1. x S z (x is South of z):
   - We know: supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
   - We also know: infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)
   - From these, we can't guarantee that supy(x) <= infy(z). It depends on the specific values.
   - However, if z doesn't extend too far south (i.e., if infy(z) is close to infy(y)), then supy(x) <= infy(z) and x S z is possible.

2. x SW z (x is Southwest of z):
   - We need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know: supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)
   - We also know: infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
   - From these, we can't guarantee that supx(x) <= infx(z). But if z is positioned at the northeastern part of y, it's possible.
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), as discussed in the previous point, it's possible if z doesn't extend too far south.

3. x W z (x is West of z):
   - We need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know: supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)
   - We also know: infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
   - From these, we can't guarantee that supx(x) <= infx(z). But if z is positioned at the eastern part of y, it's possible.
   - For infy(z) <= infy(x), we know infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z), but we don't know how infy(x) relates to infy(y) or infy(z).
   - For supy(x) <= supy(z), we know supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z). But this doesn't guarantee supy(x) <= supy(z).

4. x NW z (x is Northwest of z):
   - We need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've already established that supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible if z is positioned at the eastern part of y.
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), we know supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z). But this doesn't guarantee anything about supy(z) and infy(x).
   - Additionally, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y), which means x is entirely below y. If z extends far beyond the top of y, it's unlikely that x would be northwest of z.

5. x N z (x is North of z):
   - We need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've already established that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) can be derived from our constraints.
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), we know supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z). But this doesn't guarantee anything about supy(z) and infy(x).
   - Additionally, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y), which means x is entirely below y. It's very unlikely that x would be north of z given these constraints.

I'm going to stop here and think harder. I feel like I'm going in circles by not approaching this systematically.

OK, here's what I know:
- x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, I can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

These two inequalities mean that x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection.

Now, let's consider the possible relations based on where the y-coordinates can be:

1. If infy(z) < supy(x) < infy(y), then x and z have overlapping y-coordinates, with x being partially above and south of z. In this scenario, and given the x-coordinate constraints, x could be E z, W z, or even B z (if z is sufficiently small and contained within x).

2. If supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y), then x is strictly below z. Given the x-coordinate constraints, x would be S z.

3. If supy(x) <= infy(y) < infy(z), then x is strictly below y, which is strictly below z. Here, x would be S z.

But the actual relation also depends on the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis.

For example:
a. If infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x), then z extends to the left of x.
b. If infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) < supx(z), then z's x-projection contains x's.
c. If infx(x) < infx(z) and supx(z) < supx(x), then x's x-projection contains z's.

Actually, wait. I realize I messed up the definitions earlier. Let me make sure:

For a, b in REG:
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). This means a is South of b, and a's x-projection is contained within b's x-projection.
- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). This means a is completely contained within b's bounding box.

So, for our problem:
- x S y means: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
- y B z means: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From the definitions, clearly, B refers to the fact that one region is contained within another's bounding box. So, y B z means y is contained within z's bounding box.

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (meaning, on the x-axis, z starts before y, which starts before x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (meaning, on the x-axis, x ends before y, which ends before z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (on the y-axis, z starts before or at the same point as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (on the y-axis, y ends before or at the same point as z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (on the y-axis, x ends before y starts)

Since we know that x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection, and we know x is below y, the possible relations of x to z will depend on how x and z are positioned on the y-axis.

Now let's systematically check all the 9 possible directions:

1. x B z:
   For x to be bounded by z, infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   The first two conditions are met. For the third, we don't know if infy(z) <= infy(x). But it's possible if z extends far enough to the south. For the fourth, given supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we get supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, x B z is possible if z extends far enough to the south.

2. x S z:
   For x to be South of z, supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   The last two conditions are met. For the first, we know supy(x) <= infy(y). If infy(z) <= infy(y), we can't guarantee supy(x) <= infy(z). But if infy(z) >= infy(y), then we'd have supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z), which would make x S z.
   So, x S z is possible if z doesn't extend too far south of y.

3. x SW z:
   For x to be Southwest of z, supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We've established that supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't guarantee supx(x) <= infx(z). However, if z is positioned at the east of y, it's possible.
   For supy(x) <= infy(z), as discussed for S, it's possible if z doesn't extend too far south of y.
   So, x SW z is possible if z is positioned at the east of y and doesn't extend too far south.

4. x W z:
   For x to be West of z, supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   As discussed for SW, supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible if z is at the east of y. For infy(z) <= infy(x), we know infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't know if infy(x) >= infy(y) (or infy(z)). It's possible if x and z overlap in the y-direction. For supy(x) <= supy(z), given supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we get supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, x W z is possible if z is positioned at the east of y and there's an overlap in the y-direction between x and z.

5. x NW z:
   For x to be Northwest of z, supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
   For supx(x) <= infx(z), as discussed, it's possible if z is at the east of y. For supy(z) <= infy(x), we know supy(y) <= supy(z). Given supy(x) <= infy(y), it's unlikely for supy(z) <= infy(x) unless x and z are positioned in a very specific way.
   So, x NW z is rare but potentially possible under very specific configurations.

6. x N z:
   For x to be North of z, supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   The last two conditions are met. For the first, as discussed for NW, it's unlikely given our constraints.
   So, x N z is rare but potentially possible under very specific configurations.

7. x NE z:
   For x to be Northeast of z, supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
   We've established that infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

8. x E z:
   For x to be East of z, supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   As with NE, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is contradicted by our established constraints. So, x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z:
   For x to be Southeast of z, supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
   As with NE and E, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is contradicted. So, x SE z is not possible.

Let's just double-check the constraints that are definitely satisfied based on the given information:

1. infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): This means z's left boundary is to the left of x's.
2. supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z): This means z's right boundary is to the right of x's.
3. infy(z) <= infy(y): This means z's bottom boundary is below or at the same level as y's.
4. supy(y) <= supy(z): This means z's top boundary is above or at the same level as y's.
5. supy(x) <= infy(y): This means x is completely below y.

From these, the relations x NE z, x E z, and x SE z are not possible, as they all require supx(z) <= infx(x), which is contradicted by 1. and 2.

For the other six relations, the possibility depends on the exact positions of x, y, and z:

x B z is possible if z's bottom boundary is below x's, which can happen if z extends sufficiently far to the south.

x S z is possible if x is completely below z, which can happen if z doesn't extend too far to the south.

x SW z is possible if x is to the left and below z, which can happen if z is positioned at the east of y and doesn't extend too far to the south.

x W z is possible if x is to the left of z and they overlap in the y-direction, which can happen if z is positioned at the east of y.

x NW z is possible if x is to the left and above z, which is rare given our constraints but not strictly impossible.

x N z is possible if x is directly above z, which is rare given our constraints but not strictly impossible.

But I'm not feeling confident about the answers, so let me try again. 

Given:
- x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

The constraints from these:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)
4. infx(z) <= infx(y)
5. supx(y) <= supx(z)
6. infy(z) <= infy(y)
7. supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) using (2) and (4)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) using (3) and (5)
- And we know supy(x) <= infy(y) using (1)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) using (6)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) using (7)

Let's check if these constraints are compatible with each of the 9 possible cardinal directions between x and z.

1. x B z (x bounds z):
   - We need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From our constraints: infx(z) <= infx(x) => True
   - From our constraints: supx(x) <= supx(z) => True
   - No constraint for infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - No direct constraint for supy(x) <= supy(z), but we can derive it: supy(x) <= infy(y) (given) and infy(y) <= supy(y) (by definition of y being a valid region) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (given). So, supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For x B z to be true, we need infy(z) <= infy(x), which is not guaranteed by our constraints. It depends on the specific configurations.

2. x S z (x is South of z):
   - We need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - From our constraints: infx(z) <= infx(x) => True
   - From our constraints: supx(x) <= supx(z) => True
   - No direct constraint for supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). If infy(z) = infy(y), then supy(x) <= infy(z). But if infy(z) < infy(y), we can't guarantee supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - For x S z to be true, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), which is not guaranteed by our constraints. It depends on the specific configurations.

3. x SW z (x is Southwest of z):
   - We need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= supx(y), but we don't have direct information about infx(z).
   - And similar to the S case, supy(x) <= infy(z) is not guaranteed.
   - For x SW z to be true, both conditions must be met, but neither is guaranteed by our constraints. It depends on the specific configurations.

Hmm, let me try some more.

4. x W z (x is West of z):
   - We need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From our constraints, supx(x) <= infx(z) is not guaranteed.
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y), but there's no direct constraint for infy(x) relative to infy(y) or infy(z).
   - From our prior derivation, supy(x) <= supy(z) is true.
   - For x W z to be true, all three conditions must be met, but they are not all guaranteed by our constraints. It depends on the specific configurations.

Honestly, I'm a bit uncertain about this approach since many of the conditions are "not guaranteed" but might be true depending on the specific configurations. Let me try a more direct approach.

The derivations that are definitely true from our constraints are:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From these, we see that x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection. This immediately rules out the relations x SW z, x W z, x NW z, x NE z, x E z, and x SE z, as they all require some form of non-overlap of the x-projections.

So, the possible relations are x B z, x S z, and x N z. Actually, let me just double check these:

x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
So far we've figured out: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
Actually, given these, it's impossible that supx(x) <= infx(z), because that would imply supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), which means supx(x) <= infx(x), which is nonsensical for any valid region x. So x SW z is not possible.

x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
Using the same reasoning for x SW z, the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) can't be satisfied, so x W z is not possible.

x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
Again, the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) can't be satisfied, so x NW z is not possible.

x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
Given infx(z) <= infx(x), it's impossible for supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless z is a point, which is not considered in our setup). So, x NE z is not possible.

x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
Again, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) can't be satisfied, so x E z is not possible.

x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) can't be satisfied, so x SE z is not possible.

So, the only possible relations are x B z, x S z, and x N z. Let's check these in detail:

x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
The first two conditions are satisfied. For the third condition, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) but we don't have direct constraints between infy(x) and infy(y) or infy(z). For the fourth condition, we've already derived that supy(x) <= supy(z).
So, x B z is possible if infy(z) <= infy(x), which can happen if z extends sufficiently far to the south.

x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
The last two conditions are satisfied. For the first condition, we know supy(x) <= infy(y), but we don't have direct constraints between infy(z) and infy(y). From our problem, we know infy(z) <= infy(y).
If infy(z) < supy(x), then x S z would be false.
If infy(z) >= supy(x), then x S z would be true.
So, x S z is possible if infy(z) >= supy(x), which can happen if z doesn't extend too far to the south.

x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
The last two conditions are satisfied. For the first condition, we know supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(x) <= infy(y). It seems odd for supy(z) <= infy(x) to be true, given that x is south of y and z's y-projection extends beyond y's, but it's not strictly impossible. It would require a very specific configuration.

OK, the relations that are definitely allowed by the constraints are x B z, x S z, and possibly x N z.

But I think I've made an error. Let me use the definitions again for clarity:

For regions a, b:
- a S b (a is South of b): 
  supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a B b (a is bounded by b): 
  infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)

Given:
- x S y
- y B z

From x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's determine the constraints between x and z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (using transitivity)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (using transitivity)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (given)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (given)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (given)

We don't have a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z), or between infy(x) and supy(z). So let's check if the constraints we have are compatible with each of the 9 possible relations between x and z:

1. x B z (x is bounded by z): 
   infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From our derived constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are satisfied.
   For infy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have a direct constraint. We just know infy(z) <= infy(y). So this might be satisfied, depending on the specific configuration.
   For supy(x) <= supy(z), we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). Using transitivity and the fact that infy(y) <= supy(y) (as y is a valid region), we get supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   So, x B z is possible if infy(z) <= infy(x). This can happen if z extends sufficiently far south or if x is positioned closer to y.

2. x S z (x is South of z): 
   supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From our derived constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are satisfied.
   For supy(x) <= infy(z), we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). We can't guarantee supy(x) <= infy(z) unless infy(z) = infy(y).
   
   So, x S z is possible if infy(z) is close to infy(y).

3. x SW z (x is Southwest of z): 
   supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From our derived constraints, we have supx(x) <= supx(z) but not supx(x) <= infx(z). In fact, given infx(z) <= infx(x), it's impossible for supx(x) <= infx(z) (unless x or z are degenerate regions, which contradicts our setup).
   
   So, x SW z is not possible.

OK, let's double check the other directions too.

4. x W z (x is West of z): 
   supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   For the same reason as SW, the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) is not compatible with our constraints. So x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z (x is Northwest of z): 
   supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   Again, the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) is not compatible with our constraints. So x NW z is not possible.

6. x N z (x is North of z): 
   supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From our derived constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are satisfied.
   For supy(z) <= infy(x), we know supy(y) <= supy(z). We also know supy(x) <= infy(y). Given that x is South of y, and z's y-projection extends beyond y's, it seems unlikely for supy(z) to be below infy(x), but it's not strictly impossible.
   
   So, x N z is possible under specific, rare configurations.

7. x NE z (x is Northeast of z): 
   supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   Given supx(x) <= supx(z), it's impossible for supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless x or z are degenerate regions, which contradicts our setup). So x NE z is not possible.

8. x E z (x is East of z): 
   supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   Again, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is not compatible with our constraints. So x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z (x is Southeast of z): 
   supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   Again, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is not compatible with our constraints. So x SE z is not possible.

Based on our analysis, the relations that are compatible with the given constraints are x B z, x S z, and possibly x N z (though it requires specific configurations).

Actually, let me think of some specific configurations to verify:

Let's represent regions by their bounding boxes [infx, supx, infy, supy].

Scenario 1: 
- z = [0, 10, 0, 10]
- y = [2, 8, 2, 8] (this satisfies y B z)
- x = [3, 7, 0, 1] (this satisfies x S y)

In this scenario, x's vertical projection is completely below z, and its horizontal projection is within z's. So, x S z.

Scenario 2:
- z = [0, 10, 3, 10]
- y = [2, 8, 4, 8] (this satisfies y B z)
- x = [3, 7, 0, 3] (this satisfies x S y)

In this scenario, x's vertical projection overlaps with z's, and its horizontal projection is within z's. So, x B z.

Scenario 3 (trying to construct a case for x N z):
- z = [0, 10, 0, 5]
- y = [2, 8, 3, 4] (this satisfies y B z)
- x = [3, 7, 7, 9] (x S y would require supy(x) <= infy(y), but here supy(x) = 9 > infy(y) = 3)

Hmm, it seems like it's hard to construct a case for x N z. Let me try again for x N z:

- z = [0, 10, 0, 1]
- y = [2, 8, 0.5, 1] (this satisfies y B z)
- x = [3, 7, 2, 3] (this satisfies x S y given that supy(x) = 3 <= infy(y) = 0.5... wait, that doesn't work. Let's try again.)

- z = [0, 10, 0, 2]
- y = [2, 8, 1, 2] (this satisfies y B z)
- x = [3, 7, 0, 0.5] (this satisfies x S y? Given supy(x) = 0.5 <= infy(y) = 1. Yes, that's correct.)

Hmm, I'm having a hard time visualizing a scenario where x N z. 

Actually, I think x N z is not a possibe relation. The reason is that x is South of y (i.e., below y), and z's y-projection extends beyond y's (both below and above, due to y B z). 

For x to be North of z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x). We know that supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z). We also know supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y). 

So, infy(x) >= supy(x), which is true by defintion. And supy(z) >= supy(y), which is given. And infy(y) >= supy(x), which is also given. 

For supy(z) <= infy(x) to be true, we would need supy(z) <= supy(x), or supy(z) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). But that's a contradiction.

So, my final answer is: the relations that are compatible with the given constraints are only x B z and x S z.

Actually, sorry, let me be clearer on the reasoning. The problem is that I didn't track the constraints correctly. I have to remember that if x S y, then supy(x) <= infy(y). And if y B z, then supy(y) <= supy(z). So, using transitivity, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).

For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). Given the chain above, we would have supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This gives us supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction for a meaningful (non-empty) region x.

So, x N z is not a possible relation.

OK, so my final answer is that the relations that are compatible with the given constraints are only x B z and x S z.

Let's double-check these.

For x B z to be possible, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
The first two conditions are satisfied, as we derived earlier. For supy(x) <= supy(z), we derived that from our constraints.
For infy(z) <= infy(x), we know infy(z) <= infy(y) from y B z, but we don't have a direct constraint between infy(x) and infy(y). In fact, if x is South of y, then infy(x) could be much lower than infy(y), and thus infy(z) <= infy(x) might not always be true.

OK, so x B z is not guaranteed to be possible.

For x S z to be possible, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
The last two conditions are satisfied. For the first condition, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) from x S y, and infy(z) <= infy(y) from y B z. Again, we can't guarantee supy(x) <= infy(z) from these, as infy(z) can be less than supy(x).

So, x S z is also not guaranteed.

What if we look at specific configurations? From our earlier example, we showed that both x B z and x S z are potential relations. The key was the position of z relative to y. If z doesn't extend too far below y, then x S z is a possibility. If z does extend far below, then x B z is a possibility.

Let's also consider the other directions which we ruled out. 
For South West, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But our constraints tell us that infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x SW z is not possible.
Similarly, x W z, x NW z, x NE z, x E z, and x SE z are ruled out based on the constraints.

Actually, now I'm a bit confused. Let's go back to the original definitions and ensure we're on the right track.

For regions a, b:
- a S b (a is South of b): supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a B b (a is bounded by b): infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Given:
- x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let me derive the constraints between x and z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (using transitivity): This implies infx(z) <= infx(x).
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (using transitivity): This implies supx(x) <= supx(z).
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z).
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z).
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y).

Let's check all possible relations:

1. x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x): Satisfied (derived).
   - supx(x) <= supx(z): Satisfied (derived).
   - infy(z) <= infy(x): Not guaranteed. We only know infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't have constraints between infy(x) and infy(y).
   - supy(x) <= supy(z): Satisfied. We know supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).
   - So, x B z is possible if infy(z) <= infy(x). This can happen if z extends south or if x is positioned closer to y.

2. x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): Not guaranteed. We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). We can't guarantee supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - infx(z) <= infx(x): Satisfied (derived).
   - supx(x) <= supx(z): Satisfied (derived).
   - So, x S z is possible if supy(x) <= infy(z). This can happen if z doesn't extend too far south.

3. x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): Contradictory to our derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x), as it would imply supx(x) <= infx(x), which is impossible for a valid region.
   - So, x SW z is not possible.

4. x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): Contradictory, as explained for SW.
   - So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): Contradictory, as explained for SW.
   - So, x NW z is not possible.

6. x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): Not guaranteed. We know supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(x) <= infy(y). To satisfy this condition, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - But we also know supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x), this would imply supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction for a valid region.
   - So, x N z is not possible.

7. x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): Contradictory to our derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z), as it would imply supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which is impossible for a valid region.
   - So, x NE z is not possible.

8. x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): Contradictory, as explained for NE.
   - So, x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): Contradictory, as explained for NE.
   - So, x SE z
