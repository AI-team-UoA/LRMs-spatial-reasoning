PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's denote the relations between regions as follows:
- x SE y (x is Southeast of y)
- y NE z (y is Northeast of z)

We need to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's use the definitions of the cardinal direction relations to reason through this problem.

For x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z by combining these constraints.

East-West relationship between x and z:
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
- By transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- This means supx(z) <= infx(x), which indicates that x is to the east of z.

North-South relationship between x and z:
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y NE z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can't directly establish a clear north-south relationship between x and z because we're comparing:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

We know both x and z have their maximum y-coordinates below the minimum y-coordinate of y, but we don't know how x and z relate to each other in the north-south direction.

Let's consider the possible cases:

1. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is to the south of z.
2. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is to the north of z.
3. If there's an overlap in the y-coordinates, i.e., neither of the above conditions hold, then x and z are not in a clear north-south relationship.

Given the constraints, x is definitely to the east of z. For the north-south relationship, all three cases I just mentioned are possible, which means x could be SE, E, or NE of z.

However, let me double-check by examining specific examples to confirm these relations:

Case 1: x SE z
x is to the east of z and to the south of z.
This is consistent with our constraints.

Case 2: x E z
x is to the east of z and neither clearly north nor south of z.
This is consistent with our constraints.

Case 3: x NE z
x is to the east of z and to the north of z.
Let's check if this is consistent with our constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (consistent with x being east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (for x to be north of z)

We've established that x is to the east of z. For the north-south relationship, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)

For x to be north of z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x).

From the given constraints, we can't directly establish this. So, x being NE of z is theoretically possible.

Hmm, actually I think I may have an error in my reasoning. Let me reconsider.

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Let's think about the possible positions of x, y, and z on the coordinate plane:

- z is to the west and south of y.
- x is to the east and south of y.

This means x is to the east of z (because both x and z are positioned relative to y, and x is to the east while z is to the west).

For the north-south relationship, both x and z are to the south of y, but their relative positions to each other can vary.

Let's reconsider the possible north-south relationships between x and z:

1. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is to the south of z.
2. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is to the north of z.
3. If there's an overlap in the y-coordinates, i.e., neither of the above conditions hold, then x and z are not in a clear north-south relationship.

Wait, I actually don't think it's accurate to claim that both x and z are to the south of y from the given constraints. Let me reconsider.

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

So, x is to the east and south of y. That's clear.

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

So, y is to the east and north of z. Equivalently, z is to the west and south of y.

Now, from these, we can deduce:
- x is to the east of y.
- y is to the east of z.
- By transitivity, x is to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship:
- x is to the south of y.
- z is to the south of y.

But the north-south relationship between x and z isn't directly determined by these constraints. Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is to the south of z, making x SE of z.
2. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is to the north of z, making x NE of z.
3. If there's an overlap in the y-coordinates, i.e., neither of the above conditions hold, then x is E of z.

But actually, are there any additional constraints we can derive from the given information?

From x SE y and y NE z, I've established that x is to the east of z. Let's try to narrow down the north-south relationship between x and z.

From x SE y, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

These don't directly give us a relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z). So, based on the given constraints, x could be SE, E, or NE of z.

Let me verify with a visual example. Consider the following coordinates for regions:

Let y be a region with bounding box determined by the points (3,3) and (5,5). That is:
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 5
- infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 5

For x to be SE of y, we need:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

Let x be a region with bounding box determined by the points (6,1) and (8,2). That is:
- infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 8
- infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 2

Indeed, x is SE of y since:
- supx(y) = 5 <= infx(x) = 6
- supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 3

For y to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Let z be a region with bounding box determined by the points (1,1) and (2,2). That is:
- infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 2
- infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2

Indeed, y is NE of z since:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3
- supy(z) = 2 <= infy(y) = 3

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) = 2 and supy(x) = 2 (same level)
- infy(z) = 1 and infy(x) = 1 (same level)

In this example, x is E of z.

Let me check another example:

Keep y and z the same but adjust x to be a region with bounding box determined by the points (6,0) and (8,0.5). That is:
- infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 8
- infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 0.5

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) = 0.5 <= infy(z) = 1 (x is to the south of z)

In this example, x is SE of z.

Now, let's check one more example:

Keep y and z the same but adjust x to be a region with bounding box determined by the points (6,2.5) and (8,3). That is:
- infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 8
- infy(x) = 2.5, supy(x) = 3

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2.5 (x is to the north of z)

In this example, x is NE of z.

So, based on the given constraints, x could be SE, E, or NE of z.

Actually, let's double-check the definition of the cardinal direction relations to make sure I'm using them correctly:

For the relation a SE b, we have:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is to the south of b)

For the relation a NE b, we have:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the north of b)

For the relation a E b, we have:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a is aligned with b in the north-south direction)

OK, so the E relation requires that the primary region is contained within the vertical extent of the reference region. 

From the constraints, we've determined that x is to the east of z. For the north-south relationship, we can have:
- x to the south of z (making x SE of z).
- x to the north of z (making x NE of z).
- x aligned with z in the north-south direction (making x E of z).

Let's test one more example to check the E relation:

Let y be a region with bounding box determined by the points (3,3) and (5,5). That is:
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 5
- infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 5

Let z be a region with bounding box determined by the points (1,1) and (2,2). That is:
- infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 2
- infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2

Let x be a region with bounding box determined by the points (6,1) and (8,2). That is:
- infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 8
- infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 2

For the relation x E z to hold, we need:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of z) ✓
- infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 1 (lower bound of x's projection on y-axis is greater than or equal to lower bound of z's projection) ✓
- supy(x) = 2 <= supy(z) = 2 (upper bound of x's projection on y-axis is less than or equal to upper bound of z's projection) ✓

In this example, x is E of z.

But, it seems the equality here is a bit unclear. In our working definition, we've said that a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

OK, given the constraints, we've established that x is to the east of z. For the north-south relationship, the possible scenarios are:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z, making x SE of z)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z, making x NE of z)
3. infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is aligned with z in the north-south direction, making x E of z)
4. infy(x) < infy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x) and supy(x) < supy(z) (x overlaps with z in the north-south direction)
5. infy(x) < infy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x) and supy(z) < supy(x) (x overlaps with z in the north-south direction)
6. infy(z) < infy(x) and infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(z) < supy(x) (x overlaps with z in the north-south direction)
7. infy(z) < infy(x) and infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) < supy(z) (x overlaps with z in the north-south direction)

For scenario 4, 5, 6, and 7, x can't be represented by a single tile in the north-south direction relative to z.

Actually I think I'm making things too complicated. Let me clearly list the definitions of the 9 cardinal directions and then work back to determine which ones are possible.

For a relation a R b:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a is contained within b)

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) (a is to the south of b and aligned with b in the east-west direction)

a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is to the southwest of b)

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a is to the west of b and aligned with b in the north-south direction)

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the northwest of b)

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) (a is to the north of b and aligned with b in the east-west direction)

a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the northeast of b)

a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a is to the east of b and aligned with b in the north-south direction)

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is to the southeast of b)

Alright. We're given that x SE y, which means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

And we're also given that y NE z, which means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, let's see what we can derive for the relationship between x and z. The relative positioning on the X-axis is clear:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- This means that supx(z) <= infx(x), which positions x to the east of z.

For the Y-axis, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

From these, we can't derive a direct constraint between x and z along the Y-axis. So, x could be SE, E, or NE of z.

But wait, let's double-check the constraint y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z... or is it that z is to the south of y?)

Let's revisit the definition: a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the northeast of b).

So, y NE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z). 

For clarity, NE relation means the first region is Northeast of the second. So y is to the Northeast of z. 

So, from y NE z, it follows that z is to the southwest of y. This matches our understanding that y is to the east and north of z.

Now, let's continue with our derivation. Given:
- x is to the east and south of y.
- y is to the east and north of z.

From these, we can deduce that x is to the east of z, but the north-south relationship between x and z can vary.

Let's check which of the cardinal directions (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) could characterize the relationship between x and z.

B: This is not possible. B would mean x is contained within z. But we've established that x is to the east of z, so the regions can't overlap on the x-axis.

S: S would mean x is to the south of z and they're aligned on the east-west axis. Since we've established that x is to the east of z, they aren't aligned on the east-west axis. So, S is not a possible relation.

SW: SW would mean x is to the southwest of z. Since we've established that x is to the east of z, not to the west, SW is not a possible relation.

W: W would mean x is to the west of z. Since we've established that x is to the east of z, W is not a possible relation.

NW: NW would mean x is to the northwest of z. Since we've established that x is to the east of z, not to the west, NW is not a possible relation.

N: N would mean x is to the north of z and they're aligned on the east-west axis. Since we've established that x is to the east of z, they aren't aligned on the east-west axis. So, N is not a possible relation.

NE: NE would mean x is to the northeast of z. We've established that x is to the east of z. For NE to be the relation, we'd need x to be to the north of z as well. This is possible given the constraints.

E: E would mean x is to the east of z and they're aligned on the north-south axis. We've established that x is to the east of z. For E to be the relation, we'd need x to be within the vertical extent of z. This is possible given the constraints.

SE: SE would mean x is to the southeast of z. We've established that x is to the east of z. For SE to be the relation, we'd need x to be to the south of z as well. This is possible given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, or SE.

Let me also verify this with coordinate examples:

Let y be a region with bounding box determined by the points (3,3) and (5,5). That means:
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 5
- infy(y) = 3, supy(y) = 5

Let z be a region with bounding box determined by the points (1,1) and (2,2). That is:
- infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 2
- infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 2

For y to be NE of z, we have:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3 (y is to the east of z) ✓
- supy(z) = 2 <= infy(y) = 3 (y is to the north of z) ✓

So, the relation y NE z holds.

Case 1: x is SE of z.
Let x be a region with bounding box determined by the points (6,0) and (8,0.5). That is:
- infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 8
- infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 0.5

For x to be SE of y, we have:
- supx(y) = 5 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of y) ✓
- supy(x) = 0.5 <= infy(y) = 3 (x is to the south of y) ✓

So, the relation x SE y holds. Now, checking x SE z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of z) ✓
- supy(x) = 0.5 <= infy(z) = 1 (x is to the south of z) ✓

Indeed, x is SE of z.

Case 2: x is E of z.
Let x be a region with bounding box determined by the points (6,1.5) and (8,1.8). That is:
- infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 8
- infy(x) = 1.5, supy(x) = 1.8

For x to be SE of y, we have:
- supx(y) = 5 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of y) ✓
- supy(x) = 1.8 <= infy(y) = 3 (x is to the south of y) ✓

So, the relation x SE y holds. Now, checking x E z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of z) ✓
- infy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 1.5 (x's lower bound on the y-axis is greater than or equal to z's) ✓
- supy(x) = 1.8 <= supy(z) = 2 (x's upper bound on the y-axis is less than or equal to z's) ✓

Indeed, x is E of z.

Case 3: x is NE of z.
Let x be a region with bounding box determined by the points (6,2.5) and (8,3). That is:
- infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 8
- infy(x) = 2.5, supy(x) = 3

For x to be SE of y, we have:
- supx(y) = 5 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of y) ✓
- supy(x) = 3 <= infy(y) = 3 (x is to the south of y, though at the boundary) ✓

So, the relation x SE y holds, though it's at the boundary of the SE and E relations. Now, checking x NE z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 6 (x is to the east of z) ✓
- supy(z) = 2 <= infy(x) = 2.5 (x is to the north of z) ✓

Indeed, x is NE of z.

Based on the general constraints and the specific examples, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, or SE.

Let me reconsider once more to make sure there aren't any other possibilities, since there's the "bounding box" relation B.

Actually, B doesn't seem to be a possibility based on our reasoning above. The other non-viable options are S, SW, W, NW, and N. 

I've already shown that NE, E, and SE are valid options. So, the answer is that the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, or SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is NE of z

First, I'll analyze what these relations tell us:

From x SE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

East-West relationship between x and z:
Combining supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), by transitivity:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
This means x must be to the east of z.

North-South relationship between x and z:
From the given constraints, we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These don't establish a direct north-south relationship between x and z, meaning x could be:
- To the south of z (making x SE of z)
- Vertically aligned with z (making x E of z)
- To the north of z (making x NE of z)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
SE, E, NE
