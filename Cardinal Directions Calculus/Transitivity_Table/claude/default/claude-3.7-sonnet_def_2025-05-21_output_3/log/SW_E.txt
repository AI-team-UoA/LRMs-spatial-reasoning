PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z, given that:
- region x is SW of region y
- region y is E of region z

First, let's recall what these relations mean based on the cardinal direction definitions given:

- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
  This means that x is entirely to the southwest of y (x is both to the left and below y)

- y E z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
  This means that y is entirely to the east of z (y is to the right of z, but can overlap vertically)

Now, let's try to deduce the possible relations between x and z:

From x SW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y and z can overlap vertically)

Let's think about the possible relative positions:

1. Regarding the x-axis (east-west position):
   - x is to the left of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - z is to the left of y: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - This means x and z are both to the left of y, but their relative horizontal position to each other is unconstrained. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or they could overlap horizontally.

2. Regarding the y-axis (north-south position):
   - x is below y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - z can extend vertically beyond y in both directions: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   - This means x is definitely below y, but z could be above, below, or overlap with x vertically.

Let's analyze each possible cardinal direction relation between x and z:

- x N z: This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts our knowledge that x is below y and z can extend vertically. So this is not possible.

- x NE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we know that both x and z are to the left of y, and x is below y while z can extend vertically. So this relation is not possible.

- x E z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but we don't have constraints that guarantee this. So x E z is possible.

- x SE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Both of these are possible given our constraints. So x SE z is possible.

- x S z: This requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Given our constraints, this is possible. So x S z is possible.

- x SW z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Given our constraints, this is possible. So x SW z is possible.

- x W z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given our constraints, this is possible. So x W z is possible.

- x NW z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But given that x is below y and z can extend vertically, this relation is not guaranteed. So x NW z is possible.

- x B z: This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given our constraints, this is possible. So x B z is possible.

I think I made a mistake in my analysis above. Let me reconsider the constraints more carefully.

From x SW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y vertically lies within z)

Let's be more precise about the possible relative positions of x and z:

1. Regarding the x-axis:
   - x is to the left of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - z is to the left of y: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - This means both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative horizontal position is unclear. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or they could overlap horizontally.

2. Regarding the y-axis:
   - x is below y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - z's vertical extent contains y: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   - This means x is definitely below y, but z's vertical position relative to x depends on how far z extends below y.

Wait, I think I misunderstood the relation y E z. Let me recheck:

y E z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This actually means that y is to the right of z, but they can have vertical overlap. It doesn't necessarily mean that z contains y vertically. Let me reconsider the constraints:

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends vertically beyond y in both directions)

OK, I think I need to redraw the scenario to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly. Let me try again:

Given:
- x SW y: x is to the southwest of y, meaning x is both to the left and below y
- y E z: y is to the east of z, meaning y is to the right of z (with possible vertical overlap)

Let's visualize this:

```
    +---+
    | z |
+---+-+-+
|   | y |
+---+-+-+
    |   |
    +---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

In this diagram:
- x is to the southwest of y
- y is to the east of z

Now, what are the possible relations between x and z?

Based on the diagram and our constraints:
- x could be to the southwest of z
- x could be to the south of z
- x could be to the southeast of z (if x is horizontally to the right of z)
- x could be to the west of z (if x overlaps vertically with z)
- x could be to the east of z (if x is horizontally to the right of z and overlaps vertically)
- x could be inside the bounding box of z (B relation)

Hmm, that visualization might not be precise enough. Let me think about this more analytically:

From x SW y, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From y E z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends vertically beyond y)

From this, we can infer:
- Both x and z are to the left of y, but we don't know their relative horizontal position.
- x is below y, and z extends vertically both above and below y.

Let's consider each possible cardinal direction relation:

1. x N z: This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts our knowledge that z extends vertically beyond y (since we know x is below y, z must extend below y as well). So x N z is not possible.

2. x NE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The first condition contradicts our knowledge that both x and z are to the left of y, without a clear horizontal order. The second condition contradicts our knowledge about vertical positions. So x NE z is not possible.

3. x E z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is possible if x is horizontally to the right of z. It also requires infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which fits our knowledge. So x E z is possible.

4. x SE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first condition is possible, but the second condition requires x to be below z, which isn't guaranteed. So x SE z is possible if z doesn't extend too far below y.

5. x S z: This requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is not guaranteed. So x S z is possible if z doesn't extend too far below y.

6. x SW z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Both conditions are possible. So x SW z is possible.

7. x W z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The first condition is possible, and the third is guaranteed by our constraints. The second condition requires z to not extend too far below y. So x W z is possible.

8. x NW z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The second condition contradicts our knowledge. So x NW z is not possible.

9. x B z: This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The fourth condition is guaranteed, and the others are possible. So x B z is possible.

Let me reconsider carefully.

From x SW y, we have:
- x is to the left and below y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

From y E z, we have:
- y is to the right of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- y and z can overlap vertically: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we know:
- x is to the left of y, and z is to the left of y, but we don't know the horizontal relationship between x and z.
- x is below y. z can extend vertically beyond y, but we don't know how far below y it extends, so we don't know the vertical relationship between x and z.

Let's go through the cardinal direction relations one by one:

1. x N z: For this to be true, z must be entirely below x, i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we know that z extends at least as high as supy(y), and y is above x. So, z can't be entirely below x. Therefore, x N z is not possible.

2. x NE z: For this to be true, z must be to the left and below x, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But as we've seen, z can't be entirely below x. So, x NE z is not possible.

3. x E z: For this to be true, z must be to the left of x, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This is possible, as we don't know the horizontal relationship between x and z. It also requires vertical overlap: infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Again, we don't know how far z extends below y, so this is possible. Therefore, x E z is possible.

4. x SE z: For this to be true, z must be to the left and above x, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first condition is possible. The second condition requires z to not extend below a certain point, which is possible but not guaranteed by our constraints. Therefore, x SE z is possible.

5. x S z: For this to be true, x must be below z, i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This is possible, but not guaranteed. Also, there must be a horizontal overlap: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This is also possible. Therefore, x S z is possible.

6. x SW z: For this to be true, x must be to the left and below z, i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Both conditions are possible, given our constraints. Therefore, x SW z is possible.

7. x W z: For this to be true, x must be to the left of z, i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This is possible. It also requires vertical overlap: infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given our constraints, this is also possible. Therefore, x W z is possible.

8. x NW z: For this to be true, x must be to the left and above z, i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The first condition is possible. But the second condition contradicts our knowledge that z extends at least as high as y, and y is above x. Therefore, x NW z is not possible.

9. x B z: For this to be true, x must be contained within the bounding box of z, i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given our constraints, this is possible. Therefore, x B z is possible.

Ok, I needed to be more careful. 

Let's analyze the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is SW of y and y is E of z.

For x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z starts vertically at or below where y starts)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z ends vertically at or above where y ends)

Let's examine each possible relation:

1. x N z:
   - For x N z, we need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - We know that supy(y) ≤ supy(z), and from x SW y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - This implies supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   - Therefore, we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), because that would mean supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which is a contradiction
   - x N z is not possible

2. x NE z:
   - For x NE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - As shown in case 1, we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - x NE z is not possible

3. x E z:
   - For x E z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We know that supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - This doesn't tell us whether supx(z) ≤ infx(x) or not, so this condition is possible
   - We know that infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we don't know the relation between infy(z) and infy(x)
   - We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied
   - x E z is possible

4. x SE z:
   - For x SE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - As in case 3, the condition supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is possible
   - For supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - This doesn't guarantee that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), because it's possible that infy(z) < supy(x) < infy(y)
   - However, it's also possible that supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - x SE z is possible

5. x S z:
   - For x S z, we need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - As shown in case 4, the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is possible
   - For the horizontal conditions, we don't have enough constraints to determine them conclusively
   - x S z is possible

6. x SW z:
   - For x SW z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - For supx(x) ≤ infx(z), we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - This doesn't tell us whether supx(x) ≤ infx(z) or not, so this condition is possible
   - As shown in case 4, the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is possible
   - x SW z is possible

7. x W z:
   - For x W z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - As shown in case 6, the condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible
   - For infy(z) ≤ infy(x), we know that infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we don't know the relation between infy(x) and infy(y)
   - We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied
   - x W z is possible

8. x NW z:
   - For x NW z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We've shown in case 6 that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible
   - For supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we know that supy(y) ≤ supy(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - This implies supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   - Therefore, we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), because that would mean supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which is a contradiction
   - x NW z is not possible

9. x B z:
   - For x B z, we need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We don't have enough constraints on the horizontal bounds to determine conclusively
   - For the vertical bounds, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied
   - For infy(z) ≤ infy(x), we know that infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we don't know the relation between infy(x) and infy(y)
   - x B z is possible

In summary, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
E, SE, S, SW, W, B

Actually I need to be more careful here. Let's reconsider the constraints and check each possible cardinal direction relation systematically:

For x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is horizontally to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is vertically below y)

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is horizontally to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends vertically at least as low as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends vertically at least as high as y)

Let's examine each possible cardinal direction relation:

1. x N z:
   - For x N z, we need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - From y E z, we know supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   - From x SW y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - This means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   - Therefore, we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is required for x N z
   - x N z is not possible

2. x NE z:
   - For x NE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - As shown in case 1, we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - x NE z is not possible

3. x E z:
   - For x E z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From y E z and x SW y, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - We don't have direct constraints on the relative horizontal positions of x and z
   - From y E z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - From x SW y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - We don't have direct constraints on infy(x) relative to infy(z)
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied
   - x E z is possible

4. x SE z:
   - For x SE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We don't have direct constraints on the relative horizontal positions of x and z
   - From x SW y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - From y E z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - We don't have a direct constraint that guarantees supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - x SE z is possible

5. x S z:
   - For x S z, we need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - As in case 4, we don't have a direct constraint that guarantees supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We don't have direct constraints on the relative horizontal positions of x and z
   - x S z is possible

6. x SW z:
   - For x SW z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We don't have direct constraints on the relative horizontal positions of x and z
   - As in case 4, we don't have a direct constraint that guarantees supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - x SW z is possible

7. x W z:
   - For x W z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We don't have direct constraints on the relative horizontal positions of x and z
   - From y E z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - We don't have direct constraints on infy(x) relative to infy(z)
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied
   - x W z is possible

8. x NW z:
   - For x NW z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From y E z, we know supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   - From x SW y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - This means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   - Therefore, we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is required for x NW z
   - x NW z is not possible

9. x B z:
   - For x B z, we need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We don't have direct constraints on the relative horizontal positions of x and z
   - From y E z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - We don't have direct constraints on infy(x) relative to infy(z)
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied
   - x B z is possible

I need to be more careful about what "possible" means here. I need to determine if each constraint can be satisfied, not just that we can't rule it out because of a lack of direct constraints.

Let me reconsider each possibility carefully.

1. x N z: This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we know that supy(z) ≥ supy(y), from y E z, and supy(y) ≥ infy(y), and infy(y) ≥ supy(x) from x SW y. This gives us supy(z) ≥ supy(x), which contradicts the requirement for x N z. So, x N z is not possible.

2. x NE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). As shown in case 1, we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

3. x E z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The last condition is satisfied, as shown in case 1. For the first condition, we need to check if it's possible to position x and z such that z is entirely to the left of x. We know that both x and z are to the left of y. It seems entirely possible that z could be to the left of x. For the second condition, we know that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) from y E z. We need to establish if it's possible that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). Since there's no direct constraint linking infy(z) and infy(x), this appears possible. So, x E z is possible.

4. x SE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first condition seems possible, as discussed in case 3. For the second condition, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) from x SW y, and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) from y E z. This doesn't directly tell us if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but it doesn't rule it out either. If infy(z) is close to infy(y), then supy(x) ≤ infy(z) would hold. Since there's no constraint that prevents this, x SE z is possible.

5. x S z: This requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). As discussed in case 4, the first condition is possible. For the horizontal constraints, we know that both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative horizontal positions are not directly constrained. It's possible that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x S z is possible.

6. x SW z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Both of these conditions are possible, given our constraints. So, x SW z is possible.

7. x W z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The last condition is satisfied, as shown in case 1. For the first condition, we know that both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative horizontal positions are not directly constrained. It's possible that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). For the second condition, we know that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) from y E z. We need to establish if it's possible that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). Since there's no direct constraint linking infy(z) and infy(x), this appears possible. So, x W z is possible.

8. x NW z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The first condition is possible, as discussed in case 7. However, as shown in case 1, we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NW z is not possible.

9. x B z: This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The last condition is satisfied, as shown in case 1. For the horizontal constraints, we know that both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative horizontal positions are not directly constrained. It's possible that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). For the third condition, we know that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) from y E z. We need to establish if it's possible that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). Since there's no direct constraint linking infy(z) and infy(x), this appears possible. So, x B z is possible.

In conclusion, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
E, SE, S, SW, W, B

Actually, I think I am still not thinking about this clearly.

Let me create a clearer visual representation of the constraints to help me think about the problem more systematically.

Given:
- x SW y: This means x is to the southwest of y. Specifically, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y).
- y E z: This means y is to the east of z. Specifically, supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z starts vertically at or below where y starts), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends vertically at or above where y ends).

Visualizing this, we can say:
- x is to the southwest of y.
- z is to the west of y, but can extend vertically beyond y both above and below.

Let me analyze each possible cardinal direction relation between x and z:

1. x N z:
   For x N z, we need x to be north of z, which means x is completely above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) and there's a horizontal overlap (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y E z)
   This means supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so x cannot be completely above z. Therefore, x N z is not possible.

2. x NE z:
   For x NE z, we need x to be to the northeast of z, which means x is to the right and above z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y E z)
   This means supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so x cannot be completely above z. Therefore, x NE z is not possible.

3. x E z:
   For x E z, we need x to be to the east of z, which means x is to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and there's a vertical overlap (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y E z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y E z)
   We can see that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't tell us the relative positions of x and z horizontally.
   We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied.
   We also know infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we don't have a direct constraint on infy(x) relative to infy(z).
   It's possible to place x and z such that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x E z is possible.

4. x SE z:
   For x SE z, we need x to be to the southeast of z, which means x is to the right and below z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y E z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
   We can see that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't tell us the relative positions of x and z horizontally.
   We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   It's possible to place x and z such that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x SE z is possible.

5. x S z:
   For x S z, we need x to be to the south of z, which means x is below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) and there's a horizontal overlap (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y E z)
   We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   It's possible to place x and z such that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), so x S z is possible.

6. x SW z:
   For x SW z, we need x to be to the southwest of z, which means x is to the left and below z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y E z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
   We can see that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't tell us the relative positions of x and z horizontally.
   We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   It's possible to place x and z such that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x SW z is possible.

7. x W z:
   For x W z, we need x to be to the west of z, which means x is to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and there's a vertical overlap (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y E z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y E z)
   We can see that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't tell us the relative positions of x and z horizontally.
   We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied.
   We also know infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we don't have a direct constraint on infy(x) relative to infy(z).
   It's possible to place x and z such that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x W z is possible.

8. x NW z:
   For x NW z, we need x to be to the northwest of z, which means x is to the left and above z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y E z)
   This means supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so x cannot be completely above z. Therefore, x NW z is not possible.

9. x B z:
   For x B z, we need x to be within the bounding box of z, which means infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y E z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y E z)
   We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the condition supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is satisfied.
   We also know infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we don't have a direct constraint on infy(x) relative to infy(z).
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't tell us the relative positions of x and z horizontally.
   It's possible to place x and z such that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), so x B z is possible.

In summary, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
E, SE, S, SW, W, B

Actually I should view the problem more directly. Let's go over the possible combinations of x and z's positions that could satisfy the given constraints.

Given:
- x SW y: This means x is to the southwest of y. Specifically, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y).
- y E z: This means y is to the east of z. Specifically, supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z starts vertically at or below where y starts), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends vertically at or above where y ends).

From these constraints, we know:
- Both x and z are to the left of y.
- x is below y.
- z extends vertically at least from infy(y) to supy(y), and potentially beyond in both directions.

Let's consider the possible relative positions:

1. Horizontal:
   - x could be to the left of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - x and z could horizontally overlap: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), or infx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supx(z) ≤ supx(x), or infx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), or infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(z) ≤ supx(x)
   - x could be to the right of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

2. Vertical:
   - Since x is below y and z extends at least from infy(y) to supy(y), we know x is below a portion of z.
   - However, z could extend below infy(y), and we don't know how far.
   - If z extends below infy(y) such that infy(z) < supy(x), then x and z could have a vertical overlap.
   - If z extends below infy(y) such that infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then z could extend below x.

Combining these possibilities:

1. x could be to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and below a portion of z (supy(x) ≤ supy(z)). If infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x and z have a vertical overlap, which corresponds to the W (west) relation. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is entirely below z, which corresponds to the SW (southwest) relation.

2. x and z could horizontally overlap. If x is entirely within the horizontal extent of z (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) and there's a vertical overlap (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), then x is within the bounding box of z, which corresponds to the B (bounding box) relation. If x is entirely within the horizontal extent of z and is entirely below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), then this corresponds to the S (south) relation.

3. x could be to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and below a portion of z (supy(x) ≤ supy(z)). If infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x and z have a vertical overlap, which corresponds to the E (east) relation. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is entirely below z, which corresponds to the SE (southeast) relation.

Let's verify each of these using the formal definitions:

1. x W z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   Given the constraints, this is possible.

2. x SW z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   Given the constraints, this is possible.

3. x B z: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   Given the constraints, this is possible.

4. x S z: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   Given the constraints, this is possible.

5. x E z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   Given the constraints, this is possible.

6. x SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   Given the constraints, this is possible.

7. x N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x N z is not possible.

8. x NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   As shown in case 7, we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

9. x NW z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   As shown in case 7, we can't have supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NW z is not possible.

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
W, SW, B, S, E, SE

In summary, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
E, SE, S, SW, W, B.

ANSWER:

The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is SW of y and y is E of z.

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:

For x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as low as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as high as y)

From these constraints:
- Both x and z are to the left of y
- x is below y
- z extends vertically to include at least the entire vertical extent of y

Checking each possible relation:
- N, NE, NW: Not possible because z extends vertically at least as high as y, and y is above x
- E: Possible if x is to the right of z with vertical overlap
- SE: Possible if x is to the right and below z
- S: Possible if x is directly below z with horizontal overlap
- SW: Possible if x is to the left and below z
- W: Possible if x is to the left of z with vertical overlap
- B: Possible if x is within the bounding box of z

The possible relations are: E, SE, S, SW, W, B
