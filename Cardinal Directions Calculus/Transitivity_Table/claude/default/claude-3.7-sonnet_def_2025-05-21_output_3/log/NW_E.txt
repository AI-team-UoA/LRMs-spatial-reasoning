PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We know that:
- Region x is NW of region y. This means that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x). In other words, x is entirely to the west and north of y.
- Region y is E of region z. This means that supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). In other words, y is entirely to the east of z, and y's vertical extent is contained within z's vertical extent.

Now, we need to determine what could be the possible relations between regions x and z.

Given:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x NW y)
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y)
3. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z)
4. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y E z)
5. supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y E z)

From (1) and (3), we can derive that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). This doesn't tell us much about the direct relationship between x and z in the x-direction. x could be to the west, east, or overlap with z in the x-direction.

From (2), (4), and (5), we know that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x). So, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means that z starts below or at the same level as x in the y-direction. We also know that supy(y) ≤ supy(z), but this doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Let's think about possible configurations:

1. If x is entirely to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), then based on the y-coordinates, x could be:
   a. N of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   b. NW of z if supy(z) > infy(x).
   c. W of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

2. If x and z overlap in the x-direction (infx(z) ≤ supx(x) and infx(x) ≤ supx(z)), then based on the y-coordinates, x could be:
   a. N of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   b. NW of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x) and infx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   c. NE of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x) and supx(z) ≤ supx(x).
   d. B of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

3. If x is entirely to the east of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), then based on the y-coordinates, x could be:
   a. N of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   b. NE of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) > infy(x).
   c. E of z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Let me reconsider. From our given, we have:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we know:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x NW y)
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y)
3. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z)

From (1) and (3), we can infer that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z), so x could be to the west, east, or overlap with z in the x-direction.

However, from (2), we know that supy(y) ≤ infy(x), and from (y E z), we know that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

This means:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

So, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means that z starts below or at the same level as x in the y-direction. But we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Now, let's think about the possible configurations. I'll restate the cardinal directions:

- N: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- NE: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- E: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- SE: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- S: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- SW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- W: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- NW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- B: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given our constraints, we know:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Actually, let's rethink this. I think the confusion might be arising because I'm trying to derive constraints on x and z directly from the given relations, but that's not always possible. Instead, let's use examples to determine what relations are actually possible.

Consider a 2D coordinate system. Let's place z first, and then place y to the east of z, and finally place x to the northwest of y. We'll see what relation x has with z in each configuration.

Example 1:
- z is at the origin (0, 0) with a width and height of 1. So z occupies the region [0, 1] × [0, 1].
- y is to the east of z, let's say it's at [2, 0] with a width and height of 1. So y occupies the region [2, 3] × [0, 1].
- x is to the northwest of y, let's say it's at [1, 2] with a width and height of 1. So x occupies the region [1, 2] × [2, 3].

In this configuration, x is to the northwest of y, and y is to the east of z. What's the relation between x and z?
- x is at [1, 2] × [2, 3]
- z is at [0, 1] × [0, 1]

Comparing their x-coordinates, we see that supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 1, which means x is to the northeast, east, or southeast of z.
Comparing their y-coordinates, we see that supy(z) = 1 ≤ infy(x) = 2, which means x is to the northeast, north, or northwest of z.

Combining these, we see that x is to the northeast of z.

Example 2:
- z is at [0, 0] × [0, 2].
- y is to the east of z, let's say it's at [3, 0] × [0, 2].
- x is to the northwest of y, let's say it's at [1, 3] × [3, 4].

In this configuration:
- x is at [1, 3] × [3, 4]
- z is at [0, 0] × [0, 2]

Comparing their x-coordinates, we see that supx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 1, which means x is to the northeast, east, or southeast of z.
Comparing their y-coordinates, we see that supy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(x) = 3, which means x is to the northeast, north, or northwest of z.

Combining these, we see that x is to the northeast of z.

Let me try another example:

Example 3:
- z is at [0, 0] × [0, 4].
- y is to the east of z, let's say it's at [1, 2] × [2, 3].
- x is to the northwest of y, let's say it's at [0, 3] × [3, 4].

In this configuration:
- x is at [0, 3] × [3, 4]
- z is at [0, 0] × [0, 4]

Wait, there's a mistake in this example. If z is at [0, 0] × [0, 4], then z occupies the region from (0, 0) to (0, 4), which doesn't make sense because a region has non-zero width. Let me reorganize:

Example 3:
- z occupies the region [0, 2] × [0, 4].
- y is to the east of z, so let's say it's at [3, 1] × [1, 2].
- x is to the northwest of y, so let's say it's at [2, 3] × [3, 4].

In this configuration:
- x is at [2, 3] × [3, 4]
- z is at [0, 2] × [0, 4]

Comparing their x-coordinates, we see that supx(z) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 2, which means x is to the northeast, east, or southeast of z.
Comparing their y-coordinates, we see that infy(x) = 3 ≤ supy(z) = 4, so it's not true that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is not to the northeast, north, or northwest of z.

But wait, in this example, if z extends up to y-coordinate 4 and x starts at y-coordinate 3, then x and z overlap in the y-direction. Let me redo this:

Example 3:
- z occupies the region [0, 2] × [0, 3].
- y is to the east of z, so let's say it's at [3, 1] × [1, 2].
- x is to the northwest of y, so let's say it's at [2, 3] × [3, 4].

In this configuration:
- x is at [2, 3] × [3, 4]
- z is at [0, 2] × [0, 3]

Comparing their x-coordinates, we see that supx(z) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 2, which means x is to the northeast, east, or southeast of z.
Comparing their y-coordinates, we see that supy(z) = 3 ≤ infy(x) = 3, which means x is to the northeast, north, or northwest of z.

Combining these, we see that x is to the northeast of z.

It seems like in all our examples, x is to the northeast of z. Let's try to prove this analytically:

From our given constraints:
1. x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
2. y is E of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From (1) and from (2), we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y). But these don't give us a direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

Let's approach this differently. Given the constraints, let's try to come up with examples where x is in different positions relative to z.

Example 4:
- z occupies the region [0, 4] × [0, 4].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [5, 2] × [2, 3].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [3, 4] × [4, 5].

In this configuration:
- x is at [3, 4] × [4, 5]
- z is at [0, 4] × [0, 4]

Comparing their x-coordinates, we see that infx(x) = 3 ≤ supx(z) = 4, so they overlap in the x-direction.
Comparing their y-coordinates, we see that supy(z) = 4 ≤ infy(x) = 4, which means x is to the north of z in terms of y-coordinates.

Combining these, x is to the north of z.

In my examples, I've found that x can be NE or N of z. Let's try to find another relation, like NW.

Example 5:
- z occupies the region [3, 5] × [0, 2].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [6, 7] × [1, 2].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [5, 6] × [3, 4].

In this configuration:
- x is at [5, 6] × [3, 4]
- z is at [3, 5] × [0, 2]

Comparing their x-coordinates, we see that supx(z) = 5 ≤ infx(x) = 5, which means x is to the east of z in terms of x-coordinates.
Comparing their y-coordinates, we see that supy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(x) = 3, which means x is to the north of z in terms of y-coordinates.

Combining these, x is to the northeast of z.

Let's try again for NW:

Example 6:
- z occupies the region [4, 6] × [0, 2].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [7, 8] × [1, 2].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [3, 5] × [3, 4].

In this configuration:
- x is at [3, 5] × [3, 4]
- z is at [4, 6] × [0, 2]

Comparing their x-coordinates, we see that supx(x) = 5 ≤ infx(z) = 4, which is not true. So they overlap in the x-direction or x is to the east of z.

Hmm, I'm making a mistake in the coordinates. Let me try again. In REG style, the region (a, b) × (c, d) means from point (a, c) in the 2D plane to point (b, d), so a <= b and c <= d. The bound functions work as: infx = a, supx = b, infy = c, supy = d.

Example 6:
- z occupies the region [4, 6] × [0, 2].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [7, 8] × [1, 2].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [3, 5] × [3, 4].

In this configuration:
- x: infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 3, supy(x) = 4
- z: infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 2

For x to be NW of y, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
5 ≤ 7 and 2 ≤ 3 - Both true, so x is NW of y.

For y to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
6 ≤ 7, 0 ≤ 1, and 2 ≤ 2 - All true, so y is E of z.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x-coordinates: infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 5, infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 6
- y-coordinates: infy(x) = 3, supy(x) = 4, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 2

For x to be NW of z, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
5 ≤ 4 is false, so x is not NW of z.

In fact, since infx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(z) = 4 ≤ supx(x) = 5 ≤ supx(z) = 6, x and z overlap in the x-direction.
And since supy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(x) = 3, x is to the north of z in terms of y-coordinates.

So in this example, x is to the N of z.

Let me try again for NW:

Example 7:
- z occupies the region [5, 7] × [0, 2].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [8, 9] × [1, 2].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [2, 4] × [3, 4].

In this configuration:
- x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 3, supy(x) = 4
- z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 2

For x to be NW of y, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
4 ≤ 8 and 2 ≤ 3 - Both true, so x is NW of y.

For y to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
7 ≤ 8, 0 ≤ 1, and 2 ≤ 2 - All true, so y is E of z.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x-coordinates: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7
- y-coordinates: infy(x) = 3, supy(x) = 4, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 2

For x to be NW of z, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
4 ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ 3 - Both true, so x is NW of z.

Alright, I've found examples where:
- x is NE of z (Examples 1, 2, 3)
- x is N of z (Examples 4, 6)
- x is NW of z (Example 7)

Let me try to find examples for the remaining cardinal directions:

Example 8 (for W):
- z occupies the region [5, 7] × [1, 5].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [8, 9] × [2, 3].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [2, 4] × [4, 6].

In this configuration:
- x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6
- z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 5

For x to be NW of y, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
4 ≤ 8 and 3 ≤ 4 - Both true, so x is NW of y.

For y to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
7 ≤ 8, 1 ≤ 2, and 3 ≤ 5 - All true, so y is E of z.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x-coordinates: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7
- y-coordinates: infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 5

For x to be W of z, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
4 ≤ 5, 1 ≤ 4, and 6 ≤ 5 is false, so x is not W of z.

In this example, since infy(x) = 4 ≤ supy(z) = 5 ≤ supy(x) = 6, x and z overlap in the y-direction.
And since supx(x) = 4 ≤ infx(z) = 5, x is to the west of z in terms of x-coordinates.

So in this example, x and z overlap in the y-direction, but x is strictly to the west of z in the x-direction. This doesn't correspond to a single-tile cardinal direction, but rather to a combination like W:NW.

Let me adjust the example to get W:

Example 8 (for W):
- z occupies the region [5, 7] × [2, 7].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [8, 9] × [3, 4].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [2, 4] × [5, 6].

In this configuration:
- x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6
- z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 7

For x to be NW of y, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
4 ≤ 8 and 4 ≤ 5 - Both true, so x is NW of y.

For y to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
7 ≤ 8, 2 ≤ 3, and 4 ≤ 7 - All true, so y is E of z.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x-coordinates: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7
- y-coordinates: infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 7

For x to be W of z, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
4 ≤ 5, 2 ≤ 5, and 6 ≤ 7 - All true, so x is W of z.

So, I have examples for NE, N, NW, and W. Let's try to find examples for the remaining cardinal directions:

Example 9 (for B):
- z occupies the region [1, 10] × [1, 10].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [11, 12] × [5, 6].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [5, 7] × [7, 8].

In this configuration:
- x: infx(x) = 5, supx(x) = 7, infy(x) = 7, supy(x) = 8
- z: infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 10

For x to be NW of y, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
7 ≤ 11 and 6 ≤ 7 - Both true, so x is NW of y.

For y to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
10 ≤ 11, 1 ≤ 5, and 6 ≤ 10 - All true, so y is E of z.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x-coordinates: infx(x) = 5, supx(x) = 7, infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 10
- y-coordinates: infy(x) = 7, supy(x) = 8, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 10

For x to be B of z, we need:
infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
1 ≤ 5, 7 ≤ 10, 1 ≤ 7, and 8 ≤ 10 - All true, so x is B of z.

Let me try to find more examples:

Example 10 (for E):
- z occupies the region [1, 3] × [2, 8].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [5, 6] × [4, 5].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [4, 5] × [6, 7].

In this configuration:
- x: infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 7
- z: infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 8

For x to be NW of y, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
5 ≤ 5 and 5 ≤ 6 - Both true (note: supx(x) = infx(y), which is okay), so x is NW of y.

For y to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
3 ≤ 5, 2 ≤ 4, and 5 ≤ 8 - All true, so y is E of z.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x-coordinates: infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3
- y-coordinates: infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 7, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 8

For x to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
3 ≤ 4, 2 ≤ 6, and 7 ≤ 8 - All true, so x is E of z.

So, I now have examples for NE, N, NW, W, B, and E. Let's try to find examples for the remaining cardinal directions:

Example 11 (for SW):
- z occupies the region [7, 9] × [7, 9].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [10, 11] × [8, 9].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [5, 6] × [10, 11].

In this configuration:
- x: infx(x) = 5, supx(x) = 6, infy(x) = 10, supy(x) = 11
- z: infx(z) = 7, supx(z) = 9, infy(z) = 7, supy(z) = 9

For x to be NW of y, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
6 ≤ 10 and 9 ≤ 10 - Both true, so x is NW of y.

For y to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
9 ≤ 10, 7 ≤ 8, and 9 ≤ 9 - All true, so y is E of z.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x-coordinates: infx(x) = 5, supx(x) = 6, infx(z) = 7, supx(z) = 9
- y-coordinates: infy(x) = 10, supy(x) = 11, infy(z) = 7, supy(z) = 9

For x to be SW of z, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
6 ≤ 7 - True
11 ≤ 7 - False, so x is not SW of z.

In this example, x is actually to the NW of z, not SW.

Hmm, I think I'm struggling to find a valid example for SW. Let's think about it: If x is NW of y, and y is E of z, can x be SW of z?

- x being NW of y means x is to the northwest (upper left) of y.
- y being E of z means y is to the east (right) of z.

Given these constraints, it seems challenging to place x to the southwest (lower left) of z. Let's think geometrically:

- If z is placed, and y is to its east, then y is to the right of z.
- If x is to the northwest of y, then x is to the upper left of y.

Now, for x to be SW of z, x would need to be to the lower left of z. But if y is to the right of z, and x is to the upper left of y, then x is usually going to be to the upper side of z, not the lower side.

Let me try again:

Example 11 (for SE):
- z occupies the region [1, 3] × [8, 10].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [4, 5] × [9, 10].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [3, 4] × [11, 12].

In this configuration:
- x: infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 11, supy(x) = 12
- z: infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 8, supy(z) = 10

For x to be NW of y, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
4 ≤ 4 and 10 ≤ 11 - Both true, so x is NW of y.

For y to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
3 ≤ 4, 8 ≤ 9, and 10 ≤ 10 - All true, so y is E of z.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x-coordinates: infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4, infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3
- y-coordinates: infy(x) = 11, supy(x) = 12, infy(z) = 8, supy(z) = 10

For x to be SE of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
3 ≤ 3 and 12 ≤ 8 - The second one is false, so x is not SE of z.

In this example, x is actually to the NE of z, not SE.

Let's further analyze this. Given the constraints, can x be S, SE, or SW of z?

- x being NW of y means x is to the northwest (upper left) of y.
- y being E of z means y is to the east (right) of z.

Given these constraints, for x to be S, SE, or SW of z, x would need to be below z. But if y is to the right of z, and x is to the upper left of y, it seems like x would generally be to the north, northwest, northeast, west, east, or bounding of z, but not to the south, southeast, or southwest of z.

Let's actually think about whether x can be to the south of z. For x to be south of z, x would need to be below z.

Given:
1. x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
2. y is E of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From (1) and (2), we know that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so we can't determine the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

But for x to be south of z, we'd need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Are there other constraints that might make this impossible?

From (1) and (2), we also know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but we can't determine the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

Given our constraints, I'm struggling to find a counterexample that proves x can't be to the south, southeast, or southwest of z. But the examples I've tried seem to geometrically place x to the north, northwest, northeast, west, east, or bounding of z.

So based on the examples I've worked through, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- NE
- N
- NW
- W
- B
- E

Let me double check if x can be SE, S, or SW of z:

Let's start with S. For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

Now, from our given:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the west of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z starts at or below where y starts)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's top is at or below z's top)

For x to be S of z, we'd need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But from our given, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above y. We also know infy(z) ≤ infy(y), which means z starts at or below where y starts.

This suggests that x, being above y, would also be above z, or at the very least overlap with z in the y-direction. This contradicts the requirement for x to be S of z, which would have x below z.

Let's actually try setting up a specific example:

- z:
  infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 10. So z is in region [1, 3] x [2, 10].

- y is to the east of z:
  infx(y) = 5, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 4, supy(y) = 5. So y is in region [5, 6] x [4, 5].
  Check: supx(z) = 3 <= infx(y) = 5, infy(z) = 2 <= infy(y) = 4, and supy(y) = 5 <= supy(z) = 10. All hold, so y is E of z.

- x is to the northwest of y:
  infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 4.5, infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 1.5. So x is in region [4, 4.5] x [1, 1.5].
  Check: supx(x) = 4.5 <= infx(y) = 5, supy(y) = 5 <= infy(x) = 1. The second is false. This doesn't work. Let me redo this...
  
Oh, I made a typo. The region [4, 4.5] × [1, 1.5] is not to the NW of [5, 6] × [4, 5].

Let's reconsider. For x to be NW of y, we'd need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

So if y is at [5, 6] × [4, 5], then to be NW of y, x would need to be (for example) at [4, 4.5] × [6, 7], not [4, 4.5] × [1, 1.5].

But if x is at [4, 4.5] × [6, 7] and z is at [1, 3] × [2, 10], then x's y-coordinates are contained within z's y-coordinates, so x can't be S of z, which would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Let me double-check this with a clean example:

- z is at [1, 3] × [2, 10].
- y is to the east of z, so y is at [5, 6] × [4, 5].
- x is to the northwest of y, so x is at [4, 4.5] × [6, 7].

For y to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
3 ≤ 5, 2 ≤ 4, and 5 ≤ 10 - All true, so y is E of z.

For x to be NW of y, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
4.5 ≤ 5 and 5 ≤ 6 - Both true, so x is NW of y.

For x to be S of z, we'd need:
supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
7 ≤ 2 - False, so x is not S of z.

So indeed, x can't be S of z given our constraints. Similarly, x can't be SE or SW of z, since both of those would also require supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

I think I'm going to list the possible relations between x and z based on the examples we've explored:

- NE
- N
- NW
- W
- B
- E

Let's just double check for SE and SW:

Example 12 (for SE):
- z occupies the region [1, 3] × [8, 10].
- y is to the east of z, so it's at [4, 5] × [9, 10].
- x is to the northwest of y, so it's at [3, 4] × [11, 12].

In this configuration:
- x: infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 11, supy(x) = 12
- z: infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 8, supy(z) = 10

For x to be NW of y, we need:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
4 ≤ 4 and 10 ≤ 11 - Both true, so x is NW of y.

For y to be E of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
3 ≤ 4, 8 ≤ 9, and 10 ≤ 10 - All true, so y is E of z.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- x-coordinates: infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4, infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 3
- y-coordinates: infy(x) = 11, supy(x) = 12, infy(z) = 8, supy(z) = 10

For x to be SE of z, we need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
3 ≤ 3 (true, but it would be wrong to say "strictly east" since the bounds are the same) and 12 ≤ 8 (false), so x is not SE of z.

In this example, since supx(z) = infx(x), we can say x is to the right of z. And since supy(z) < infy(x), we can say x is above z. So x is to the NE of z.

Actually, let's reconsider. For two regions p and q, we have the following definitions:
- p E q iff supx(q) ≤ infx(p), infy(q) ≤ infy(p), and supy(p) ≤ supy(q)
- p SE q iff supx(q) ≤ infx(p) and supy(p) ≤ infy(q)

For the E relation, the "=" part of the "≤" allows for the regions to touch, but not overlap. The same applies to the SE relation.

In our example, for x to be SE of z:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
3 ≤ 3 (true, they touch) and 12 ≤ 8 (false), so x is not SE of z.

Hmm, wait, I'm getting confused again. Let's refer back to the original definitions:

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
a E b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

Let's stick with these. For x to be SE of z, we'd need:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
3 ≤ 3 (true) and 12 ≤ 8 (false), so x is not SE of z.

Actually, given our constraints:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's vertical extent is contained within z's)

For x to be SE of z, we'd need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But if supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), then infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means x can't be below z's lower boundary, so x can't be SE of z.

Similarly, x can't be S or SW of z either.

So, I'm going with my previous list of possible relations:
- NE
- N
- NW
- W
- B
- E

ANSWER:

Based on the constraints given, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, when x is NW of y and y is E of z.

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints:
1. We know x is to the west and north of y
2. We know y is to the east of z with its vertical extent contained within z's

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

NW: When x is completely to the west and north of z
N: When x is directly north of z with horizontal overlap
NE: When x is to the north and east of z
W: When x is directly west of z with vertical overlap
B: When x is contained within z's bounding box
E: When x is directly east of z with vertical overlap

The answer is: NW, N, NE, W, B, E
