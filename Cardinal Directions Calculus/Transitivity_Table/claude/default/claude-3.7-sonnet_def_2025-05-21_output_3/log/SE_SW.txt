PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break down this problem:

1. Region x is SE of region y. This means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. Region y is SW of region z. This means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z based on these constraints.

From (1) and (2), we can deduce:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from 2)

This means both x and z are to the east of y, but we don't know their relative east-west positioning directly.

From (1) and (2), we can also deduce:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from 1)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from 2)

Combining these two gives us:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z)

So, x is to the south of z.

Based on the east-west positioning, x could be:
- To the east of z, which means x could be SE of z.
- To the west of z, which means x could be S of z.
- Neither to the east nor west (but within the east-west bounds of z), which means x could be S of z.

Let's double-check our deduction by drawing out the bounding boxes and visualizing the constraints.

Given:
- x is SE of y, so x is to the south and east of y.
- y is SW of z, so y is to the south and west of z.

This means:
- z is to the north and east of y.
- x is to the south and east of y.

Hmm, wait. Let me rethink this. I made an error in the earlier reasoning.

Let's redefine the relations more clearly:

1. Region x is SE of region y. This means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. Region y is SW of region z. This means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

We want to find out what could be the possible relation between x and z.

First, we know that y is to the west of z (supx(y) <= infx(z)). We also know that x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x)). But this doesn't tell us directly about the east-west relationship between x and z.

Second, we know that y is to the south of z (supy(y) <= infy(z)). We also know that x is to the south of y (supy(x) <= infy(y)). Combined, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z), which means x is definitely to the south of z.

So, x is to the south of z, but the east-west relationship is unclear from the given information.

Let's try to enumerate the possible scenarios for the east-west relationship between x and z:

1. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the east of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the south of z, x would be SE of z.

2. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the west of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the south of z, x would be SW of z.

3. If there's overlap in the east-west direction (neither of the above is true), then x would be S of z.

But does our initial information constrain the east-west relationship between x and z? Let's check: Given that y is SW of z and x is SE of y, I think all three of the above scenarios are possible:
- x could be to the east of z (SE of z).
- x could be overlapping with z in the east-west direction (S of z).
- x could be to the west of z (SW of z).

Let's illustrate this using a simple coordinate system. Let's say the bounding box of y is [0, 1] x [0, 1] (i.e., y covers the unit square in the first quadrant).

Given that x is SE of y, x would be to the east and south of y. So, x's bounding box could be something like [2, 3] x [-1, 0].

Given that z is NE of y, z would be to the north and east of y. (Hmm, wait, we're told that y is SW of z, which means z is NE of y, not that z is NE of y. But that's the same thing, just phrased differently).

So, z's bounding box could be something like [2, 3] x [2, 3].

In this example, x is SE of z.

But we could also have z's bounding box as [3, 4] x [2, 3], and then x would be S of z.

Or, we could have z's bounding box as [4, 5] x [2, 3], and then x would be SW of z.

Hmm, actually, I think I was wrong in my earlier reasoning. Let me reconsider the constraints carefully.

If x is SE of y, then:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

If y is SW of z, then:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From these, we can deduce:
- Since x is to the east of y and y is to the west of z, we don't have direct information about the east-west relationship between x and z.
- Since x is to the south of y and y is to the south of z, we can conclude that x is to the south of z.

To visualize this better, let's use a concrete example. Suppose:
- y has bounding box [0, 1] x [0, 1]
- x, being SE of y, has bounding box [2, 3] x [-2, -1]
- z, with y being SW of it, has bounding box [2, 3] x [2, 3]

In this example, x is S of z (they're aligned east-west, but x is to the south).

Now, let's adjust z:
- z with bounding box [4, 5] x [2, 3] would make x SW of z.
- z with bounding box [1, 2] x [2, 3] would make x SE of z.

So it seems that the possible relations between x and z could be: S, SE, SW

But wait, maybe this is not considering all possibilities. Let me think more systematically.

Actually, I think I was correct in my earlier analysis. To determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to check the cardinal directions.

Given the constraints, x is definitely to the south of z. But the east-west relationship between x and z is unconstrained.

So the possible relations are:
- If x is to the east of z, then x is SE of z.
- If x is to the west of z, then x is SW of z.
- If x is neither strictly to the east nor strictly to the west of z (they overlap in the east-west direction), then x is S of z.

Let's verify this with more concrete examples:

Example 1:
- y has bounding box [0, 1] x [0, 1]
- x, being SE of y, has bounding box [2, 3] x [-2, -1]
- z, with y being SW of it, has bounding box [3, 4] x [2, 3]

In this case, x is SW of z.

Example 2:
- y has bounding box [0, 1] x [0, 1]
- x, being SE of y, has bounding box [2, 3] x [-2, -1]
- z, with y being SW of it, has bounding box [1, 2] x [2, 3]

In this case, x is SE of z.

Example 3:
- y has bounding box [0, 1] x [0, 1]
- x, being SE of y, has bounding box [2, 3] x [-2, -1]
- z, with y being SW of it, has bounding box [2, 3] x [2, 3]

In this case, x is S of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given the constraints, are S, SE, or SW.

Actually, I missed one possibility. Since x is to the south of z, x could also be in the B (bounding box) relation with z if x is completely contained within the bounding box of z.

But wait, that's not possible given the constraints. If x is in the B relation with z, then:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), and
- infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

But since x is to the south of y and y is to the south of z, we know that supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z), which means x cannot be in the bounding box of z.

Actually, let's take a step back. The B relation means the first region is entirely within the bounding box of the second region. Given that x is to the south of z, x cannot be within the bounding box of z, so the B relation is not possible.

Actually, I'm a bit confused with the definition of B. Let me revisit it:

The B relation is defined as:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means a is entirely within the bounding box of b. Given that x is to the south of z, it's not possible for x to be entirely within the bounding box of z, so x cannot be in the B relation with z.

Just to double check: is it even possible for a region to be both S and B? If a is completely inside the bounding box of b, then it's the B relation. If a is to the south of b, then it's the S relation. These seem to be mutually exclusive. Am I missing something?

Hmm, wait actually, I need to be clearer about the B relation. 

The B relation is defined as:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means a is entirely within the bounding box of b. Another way of saying this is that the minimum bounding box of a is contained within the minimum bounding box of b.

Now, if a is in the S relation with b, then supy(a) <= infy(b). But given the definition of B, for a to be in the B relation with b, we need supy(a) <= supy(b), which is always true if supy(a) <= infy(b) (since infy(b) <= supy(b)). But we also need infy(b) <= infy(a), which contradicts with supy(a) <= infy(b) if a is a proper region (i.e., infy(a) < supy(a)). So I think B and S are mutually exclusive.

Let me just quickly visualize a B relation:

    +------+
    |      |
    |  +|  |
    |  ||  |
    |  +|  |
    |   |  |
    +---|--+

Here, the inner region is in the B relation with the outer region.

Alright, more generally, the B relation is mutually exclusive with the other cardinal direction relations (S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE), since these cardinal directions place the region outside the bounding box of the reference, while the B relation specifies that the region is inside. But a region in a cardinal direction relation, like S, can also have parts of it that are in other cardinal directions, like SE or SW. But that's a multi-tile relationship, not a single-tile one (which are what the question is asking about).

Alright, considering all of this, the possible relations between x and z, given the constraints, are S, SE, or SW.

Let's verify this with a slightly more rigorous approach. We have:

1. x is SE of y. This means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. y is SW of z. This means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From (1) and (2), we can derive:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z) (transitivity). This means x is to the south of z.

In terms of east-west positioning, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from (1))
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from (2))

But these don't give us a direct comparison between x and z. We need to check all possible cases:

Case 1: If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the east of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the south of z, x would be SE of z.

Case 2: If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the west of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the south of z, x would be SW of z.

Case 3: If there's overlap in the east-west direction (neither of the above is true), then x would be S of z.

All of these cases are consistent with the given constraints, so the possible relations are S, SE, and SW.

Let me review the definition of the S, SE, and SW relations to make sure my analysis is correct.

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For Case 1 (supx(z) <= infx(x)), combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), we get the SE relation.
For Case 2 (supx(x) <= infx(z)), combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), we get the SW relation.

For Case 3, we have supy(x) <= infy(z) and there's overlap in the east-west direction. To satisfy the S relation, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Let's check if this is consistent with the constraints:

Given the overlap in the east-west direction, it's possible that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This is consistent with the constraints from the first two relations, so the S relation is possible.

Actually before I give the final verdict I'll just double check the definition of the S relation again:

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

I have to double check:
So we already know that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).

The conditions for x S z are:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we know is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (meaning z extends at least as far to the west as x, or in other words, x doesn't extend further to the west than z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (meaning z extends at least as far to the east as x, or in other words, x doesn't extend further to the east than z)

Do these conditions automatically follow from our given constraints? Let's see.

From our constraints, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (meaning x is fully to the east of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (meaning z is fully to the east of y)

These don't allow us to directly compare infx(x) with infx(z) or supx(x) with supx(z). x could extend further to the west than z, or z could extend further to the west than x. Similarly, x could extend further to the east than z, or z could extend further to the east than x.

So the S relation is only possible if both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) hold, which are additional constraints not enforced by the given information.

But my Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 are all consistent with the given constraints.

Case 1 gives us the SE relation.
Case 2 gives us the SW relation.
Case 3 gives us the S relation (with the additional condition that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)).

Actually, let me double check Case 3 again, to make sure I interpreted the conditions for S correctly.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we know is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (meaning z extends at least as far to the west as x, or in other words, x doesn't extend further to the west than z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (meaning z extends at least as far to the east as x, or in other words, x doesn't extend further to the east than z)

This means the bounding box of x in the x-dimension is contained within the bounding box of z in the x-dimension, and also x S z.

Wait, I think I was getting confused with the definitions of the cardinal direction relations. Let me restate the definitions to ensure clarity.

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b) AND infx(b) <= infx(a) AND supx(a) <= supx(b)
  This places a to the south of b, with a's x-dimension contained within b's x-dimension.

- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) AND supy(a) <= infy(b)
  This places a to the southeast of b.

- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) AND supy(a) <= infy(b)
  This places a to the southwest of b.

Now, given our constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

For the east-west relationship, there are three cases:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z). This, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), gives the SE relation.
2. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z). This, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), gives the SW relation.
3. infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-dimension is contained within z's x-dimension). This, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), gives the S relation.

All three cases are possible given the original constraints, so the possible relations between x and z are S, SE, and SW.

Actually, I see that there's another possible relationship I missed. It's possible for the x-projections of x and z to partially overlap, rather than one being contained within the other. Let's introduce these scenarios:

4. infx(x) < infx(z) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) (x extends to the west of z, but not as far to the east). Combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), this doesn't fit any of the pure cardinal directions.

5. infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(z) < supx(x) (x doesn't extend as far to the west as z, but does extend to the east of z). Combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), this doesn't fit any of the pure cardinal directions.

Wait, scenario 4 and scenario 5 don't actually make sense the way I've described them. Let me think of more concrete examples to clarify this.

Oh, I missed the definition of a cardinal direction relation in the notes:

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where:
i) 1 <= k <= 9,
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE},
iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j,
iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

And the definitions of each cardinal direction as I stated earlier are correct. So the cardinal directions partition the space around a reference region.

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to check which of these partitions x can be in, given the constraints.

We've established that x is to the south of z, so x can only be in the S, SW, or SE partitions. Which of these partitions x falls into depends on the exact positions of x and z, and the constraints leave all three options open.

Ok, with that long discussion, I'm confident that the possible relations between x and z given that x is SE of y and y is SW of z are:
- x S z (x is to the south of z and x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)
- x SE z (x is to the southeast of z, meaning x is to the south and east of z)
- x SW z (x is to the southwest of z, meaning x is to the south and west of z)

These three relations are all consistent with the constraints and no other cardinal direction relation is possible.

Actually, wait, I think I should double check one more thing: is there a way for x to be E or W of z?

For x to be E of z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection)

Given our constraint that supy(x) <= infy(z), the second requirement for x to be E of z can't be satisfied. So, x can't be E of z.

Similarly, for x to be W of z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection)

Again, given that supy(x) <= infy(z), the second requirement for x to be W of z can't be satisfied. So, x can't be W of z.

What about NE, NW, N ? Well we've already show that x is to the south of z, so it can't be to the north.

What about B (inside the bounding box)? Well, we know we have supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z). This means supy(x) <= infy(z). If x is inside the bounding box of z, then infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). But we just deduced that supy(x) <= infy(z). If both of these are true, then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies supy(x) <= infy(x). Since x is a proper region, we know infy(x) < supy(x), which yields a contradiction. So x can't be inside the bounding box of z.

OK great, our final results are: x can be S, SE, or SW of z.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From these, I can derive:

1. Since x is SE of y:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. Since y is SW of z:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means x is definitely to the south of z. However, the east-west relationship between x and z is not directly constrained.

Therefore, the possible relations are:
- S (if x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection)
- SE (if x is to the east of z)
- SW (if x is to the west of z)

The answer is: S, SE, SW
