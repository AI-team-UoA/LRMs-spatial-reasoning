PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through the cardinal direction constraints we have:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is N of region z

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let's use the definitions of E and N from the context:

x E y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

y N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's try to derive constraints on the relationship between x and z based on these two conditions.

From x E y, we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y N z, we have:
4. supy(z) <= infy(y)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z)

From 1 and 6, we get:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
This means that potentially infx(x) and supx(z) can be in any order relative to each other. So along the x-axis, x could be E, NE, or SE of z.

From 3 and 4, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
This implies supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), which further implies supy(x) >= supy(z) or supy(x) < supy(z).

Let's consider the two cases separately:

Case 1: supy(x) >= supy(z)
If we combine this with fact 4 (supy(z) <= infy(y)), we get supy(x) >= infy(y).
Actually, this is not the right approach, let me reanalyze.

The key is to see what constraints we can derive on the relationship between x and z. Let me go back to the definitions and be more systematic.

From x E y, we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y on the x-axis)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (the southern boundary of x is north of or aligned with the southern boundary of y)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (the northern boundary of x is south of or aligned with the northern boundary of y)

From y N z, we have:
4. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z on the y-axis)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y) (the western boundary of y is east of or aligned with the western boundary of z)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z) (the eastern boundary of y is west of or aligned with the eastern boundary of z)

Now let's try to derive constraints on the relationship between x and z:

From 1 and 6, we get:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
So, supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z))

If infx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(z).
If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).

In both cases, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but the relative ordering of infx(x) and supx(z) can vary.

Similarly, from 2, 3, 4, and 5, we need to determine the constraints on the y-coordinates.

From 3 and 4, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
This means supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= supy(y).

Now, let's think about what this means for the possible relations between x and z.

If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x could be E of z.
If infx(x) <= supx(z), we need to consider the y-coordinates as well.

From 4, we have supy(z) <= infy(y).

We also know from 2 that infy(y) <= infy(x).

Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x).

So, x could be NE or E or SE of z.

But wait, I need to consider the complete definition of cardinal directions more carefully:

- x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
- x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

From 1 and 6, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This means that supx(z) could be greater than or equal to infx(x), which would rule out E, NE, and SE.

I should revisit our constraints more carefully.

From x E y, we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y on the x-axis)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (the southern boundary of x is north of or aligned with the southern boundary of y)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (the northern boundary of x is south of or aligned with the northern boundary of y)

From y N z, we have:
4. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z on the y-axis)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y) (the western boundary of y is east of or aligned with the western boundary of z)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z) (the eastern boundary of y is west of or aligned with the eastern boundary of z)

Now, let's reason about the possible relations between x and z based on these constraints.

From 1 and 6, we get:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, we have two possibilities:
a. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the east of z on the x-axis.
b. If infx(x) <= supx(z), then we need to consider the y-coordinates.

From 2 and 4, we get:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x).

From 3 and 4, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
We can't directly derive a relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) from these.

From 5 and 1, we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x)
We can't directly derive a relationship between infx(z) and infx(x) from these.

Let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations one by one:

1. x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(x) from (2) and (4).
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(y) from (5), but we don't know the relationship between infx(y) and infx(x).
   - We know supx(y) <= supx(z) from (6), but we don't know the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).
   So, N is possible, but not guaranteed.

2. x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(x) from (2) and (4).
   - From (1) and (6), supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x).
   So, NE is possible, but not guaranteed.

3. x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We've discussed that supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible, but not guaranteed.
   - From (2) and (4), supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which doesn't give us information about infy(z) relative to infy(x).
   - We don't have direct information about the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).
   So, E is possible, but not guaranteed.

4. x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - We've discussed that supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible, but not guaranteed.
   - We don't have direct information about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   So, SE is possible, but not guaranteed.

Actually, now that I think about it, we can derive more about the relationship. Let's be more careful here.

From x E y:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y on the x-axis)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (the southern boundary of x is north of or aligned with the southern boundary of y)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (the northern boundary of x is south of or aligned with the northern boundary of y)

From y N z:
4. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z on the y-axis)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y) (the western boundary of y is east of or aligned with the western boundary of z)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z) (the eastern boundary of y is west of or aligned with the eastern boundary of z)

Now, for x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From 1 and 6, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x). So, we can't guarantee that x is E of z.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From 2 and 4, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). So, supy(z) <= infy(x).
From 5, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't know the relationship between infx(y) and infx(x).
From 6 and 1, we have supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x), but this doesn't provide a direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

So, x being N of z is possible.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've already confirmed that supy(z) <= infy(x).
However, from 1 and 6, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which doesn't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x).

That means x being NE of z is possible.

Wait, I think I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let's use a diagram to visualize the relationships.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is N of region z

In terms of the minimum bounding box, x being E of y means that the bounding box of x is entirely to the east of the bounding box of y. Similarly, y being N of z means that the bounding box of y is entirely to the north of the bounding box of z.

Now, if y is N of z and x is E of y, then x is to the northeast of z. But the precise cardinal direction can vary.

Ah, I see the key issue I was overlooking. Let's consider: x is E of y means that x is to the east of y, but it doesn't specify the north-south relationship between x and y. Similarly, y is N of z means that y is to the north of z, but it doesn't specify the east-west relationship between y and z.

Let's be more specific and use the definitions given at the beginning:

x E y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
y N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

From these, we can derive:

1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y on the x-axis)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (the southern boundary of x is north of or aligned with the southern boundary of y)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (the northern boundary of x is south of or aligned with the northern boundary of y)
4. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z on the y-axis)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y) (the western boundary of y is east of or aligned with the western boundary of z)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z) (the eastern boundary of y is west of or aligned with the eastern boundary of z)

From 1 and 5, we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) <= infx(x).

From 4 and 2, we get:
supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), which implies supy(z) <= infy(x).

From 6, we have: supx(y) <= supx(z). But from 1, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). These don't give us a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). It's possible for supx(z) to be less than infx(x), but it's also possible for supx(z) to be greater than infx(x).

Similarly, from 3, we have: supy(x) <= supy(y). But from 4, we have supy(z) <= infy(y). These don't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(z). It's possible for supy(x) to be less than, equal to, or greater than supy(z).

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z could be:

1. NE: If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), which we've shown is possible.
2. E: If supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible, but we would need (infy(z) <= infy(x)) and (supy(x) <= supy(z)).
3. SE: If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible, but we would need (supy(x) <= infy(z)).
4. N: If supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've shown supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x), but we would need (supx(x) <= supx(z)).
5. NW: If infx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x), but we would need (infx(x) <= supx(z)) which is possible.

Let's look at what constraints we'd need for x to be each of the possible cardinal directions for z:

B - x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the above analysis, we know infx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) might be satisfied. However, we don't know for sure about supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x B z is a possibility.

E - x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've shown supx(z) <= infx(x) is a possibility (though not guaranteed). From 2 and 4, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x). But, we don't have a direct constraint on supy(x) and supy(z). So, x E z is a possibility.

SE - x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've shown supx(z) <= infx(x) is a possibility. But, we don't have direct information about supy(x) and infy(z). So, x SE z is a possibility.

NE - x NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've shown both of these constraints are possible. So, x NE z is a possibility.

N - x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've shown supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) are satisfied. But, we don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) and supx(z). So, x N z is a possibility.

NW - x NW z:
- infx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know supy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied. That infx(x) <= supx(z) is a possibility, but not guaranteed. So, x NW z is a possibility.

W - x W z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the constraints, we have infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know about supx(x) <= infx(z) (in fact, from our analysis it seems like infx(z) <= infx(x), which would contradict this). So, x W z is not a possibility.

SW - x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the constraints, it seems like infx(z) <= infx(x) (which would contradict supx(x) <= infx(z)). So, x SW z is not a possibility.

S - x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From the constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), but we don't know about supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x S z is a possibility.

Actually, let's be even more precise about our constraints:

From the given statements, we derive:

1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y on the x-axis)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (the southern boundary of x is north of or aligned with the southern boundary of y)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (the northern boundary of x is south of or aligned with the northern boundary of y)
4. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z on the y-axis)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y) (the western boundary of y is east of or aligned with the western boundary of z)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z) (the eastern boundary of y is west of or aligned with the eastern boundary of z)

Now, regarding the constraints for x S z (supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)):

We have derived infx(z) <= infx(x) from 5 and 1. We don't have direct constraints for supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which means they might or might not be satisfied.

However, from 3 and 4, we have supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). This means supy(x) can be below or at the top boundary of y, and z's top boundary is below y's bottom boundary. While this doesn't guarantee that supy(x) <= infy(z), it's possible under certain configurations. So, x S z is a possibility.

Similarly, for other cardinal directions, we would check if the constraints are satisfied.

x B z: we don't have sufficient constraints to rule out or confirm.
x E z: from 2, infy(z) <= infy(x) is possible. From 1 and 6, supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x). We also don't have a direct constraint for supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x E z is a possibility.
x SE z: similar to the E case, we can't rule out the possibility.
x NE z: we've established supy(z) <= infy(x), and supx(z) <= infx(x) is a possibility. So, x NE z is a possibility.
x N z: we've shown supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x). However, we don't have a direct constraint for supx(x) <= supx(z), but it's potential constraints don't rule it out either. So, x N z is a possibility.
x NW z: we've shown supy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied. From 1 and 6, supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which means supx(z) >= supx(y) and infx(x) >= supx(y). This doesn't give us a direct constraint on infx(x) and supx(z), so infx(x) <= supx(z) is a possibility. So, x NW z is a possibility.

x W z: It requires supx(x) <= infx(z), but from 1 and 5, supx(y) <= infx(x) (because x is east of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (because y is north of z). Combining these, supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which can be infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This implies infx(z) <= infx(x), not supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x W z is not a possibility.

x SW z: It requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've shown supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible. So, x SW z is not a possibility.

x S z: It requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've shown infx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied. For supy(x) <= infy(z), from 3 and 4, supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), which means z's top is below y's bottom and x's top is below y's top, but we don't have a direct constraint on supy(x) and infy(z), so it's a possibility.

The constraints as derived actually don't give us a full picture of the relationship between x and z. For example, that z is south of y doesn't tell us how east or west z is relative to y. Similarly, that x is east of y doesn't tell us how north or south x is relative to y. As a result, x and z can have various relationships with each other.

Let me analyze all nine possible cardinal directions:

1. B (the "bounds" region):
   For x B z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've derived infx(z) <= infx(x), and infy(z) <= infy(x) might be satisfied due to the transitive relationship through y.
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints, but it's possible if x is only slightly to the east of y.
   - For supy(x) <= supy(z), we don't have direct constraints, but it's possible if x is only slightly below the top of y and z extends above y.
   B is a possibility, but not a certainty.

2. N (North):
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've shown supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints, but it's possible if x is only slightly to the east of y.
   N is a possibility, but not a certainty.

3. NE (Northeast):
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've shown supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), it's possible if x is sufficiently to the east.
   NE is a possibility, but not a certainty.

4. E (East):
   For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), it's possible if x is sufficiently to the east.
   - For infy(z) <= infy(x), it might be satisfied due to the transitive relationship through y.
   - For supy(x) <= supy(z), it's possible if x is only slightly below the top of y and z extends above y.
   E is a possibility, but not a certainty.

5. SE (Southeast):
   For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), it's possible if x is sufficiently to the east.
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we don't have direct constraints.
   SE is a possibility, but a bit less likely given the constraints.

6. S (South):
   For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've shown infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we don't have direct constraints.
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints.
   S is a possibility, but a bit less likely given the constraints.

7. SW (Southwest):
   For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've derived infx(z) <= infx(x) (from 5 and 1), which is the opposite of supx(x) <= infx(z).
   SW is not a possibility.

8. W (West):
   For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've derived infx(z) <= infx(x), which is the opposite of supx(x) <= infx(z).
   W is not a possibility.

9. NW (Northwest):
   For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've shown supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've derived infx(z) <= infx(x), which is the opposite of supx(x) <= infx(z).
   NW is not a possibility.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be: B, N, NE, E, SE, and S.

Actually, I realized there's an oversight in my analysis. Let me re-examine the NW, W, and SW cases:

For NW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've shown infx(z) <= infx(x). Note that this doesn't directly imply that supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible. It just means that the western boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x. It's still possible for the eastern boundary of x to be to the west of the western boundary of z, which would make supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is a possibility.

For W, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've shown infx(z) <= infx(x). The same logic as for NW applies here: it's possible for the eastern boundary of x to be to the west of the western boundary of z, even though the western boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x. So, W is a possibility.

For SW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Using the same logic, supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible. From 3 and 4, supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). These don't give us a direct constraint for supy(x) <= infy(z). So, SW is a possibility.

Actually, let me try to be even more explicit.

For NW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've shown supy(z) <= infy(x). But, from 1 and 5, supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This means the eastern boundary of y is to the west of the western boundary of x, and the western boundary of z can be as far west as the western boundary of y. So, the western boundary of z might be to the west of the eastern boundary of x. But for x to be northwest of z, the eastern boundary of x should be to the west of the western boundary of z, which is not guaranteed by the constraints. So, NW is not a possibility.

For W, the logic is similar to NW, and W is also not a possibility. And similarly for SW.

Wait, I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let's be very explicit about the definitions and constraints once again.

From the cardinal direction definitions, we have:

- x E y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, we want to determine the possible relations between x and z. Well, since x is east of y (meaning the whole of x is to the east of y) and y is north of z (meaning the whole of y is to the north of z), the only relative spatial positioning of x and z can be determined is that x is to the northeast of z. This doesn't mean x is necessarily NE of z in the cardinal direction sense; it just means that x is in the general northeast direction from z.

To determine the specific cardinal direction, we need more precise information. But given the constraints, let's check each possibility:

1. B (the "bounds" region):
   For x B z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   From x E y and y N z, we can only determine that x is to the northeast of z. This doesn't rule out or confirm B.

   But actually, B doesn't make sense (meaning that z would contain x) since we just established that x is northeast of z.

2. N (North):
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From 4, 2, and transitivity, we know supy(z) <= infy(x).
   From 5, 1, and transitivity, we know infx(z) <= infx(x).
   For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints, but it's possible.
   N is a possibility.

3. NE (Northeast):
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   From 4, 2, and transitivity, we know supy(z) <= infy(x).
   For supx(z) <= infx(x), from 1 and 6, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This means supx(z) could be either less than or greater than infx(x).
   NE is a possibility if supx(z) <= infx(x).

4. E (East):
   For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   For supx(z) <= infx(x), the same logic as for NE applies.
   For infy(z) <= infy(x), given that y is north of z and x can be anywhere to the east of y, z's bottom can be either below or above x's bottom.
   For supy(x) <= supy(z), given that x is east of y and y is north of z, x's top can be either below or above z's top.
   E is a possibility.

5. SE (Southeast):
   For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   For supx(z) <= infx(x), the same logic as for NE applies.
   For supy(x) <= infy(z), given that y is north of z and x is east of y with supy(x) <= supy(y), it's possible for supy(x) to be below infy(z).
   SE is a possibility.

6. S (South):
   For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   For supy(x) <= infy(z), the same logic as for SE applies.
   For infx(z) <= infx(x), we've shown this is satisfied.
   For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints, but it's possible.
   S is a possibility.

7. SW (Southwest):
   For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   For supx(x) <= infx(z), given that x is to the east of y and z can be anywhere south of y, there's no guarantee that z is to the east of x. But if z is sufficiently to the east, then it's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z).
   For supy(x) <= infy(z), the same logic as for SE applies.
   SW is a possibility, but it seems less likely given the general northeast direction of x from z.

8. W (West):
   For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   For supx(x) <= infx(z), the same logic as for SW applies.
   For infy(z) <= infy(x), the same logic as for E applies.
   For supy(x) <= supy(z), the same logic as for E applies.
   W is a possibility, but seems less likely given the general northeast direction of x from z.

9. NW (Northwest):
   For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   For supx(x) <= infx(z), the same logic as for SW applies.
   For supy(z) <= infy(x), we've shown this is satisfied.
   NW is a possibility, but seems less likely given the general northeast direction of x from z.

In conclusion, all eight cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) are technically possibilities for the relation between x and z, with some being more likely (N, NE, E) given the constraints. B doesn't make sense since x is to the northeast of z.

I'm confused now, let me restart:

Given:
- Region x is E of region y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- Region y is N of region z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

We're considering every possible region configuration that satisfies these two constraints. We need to determine what the possible relations are between x and z.

Let's check each cardinal direction relation that x may have with z:

1. E: For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From the given constraints:
We know supx(y) <= infx(x) but can't derive the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
We know infy(y) <= infy(x) but can't derive the relation between infy(z) and infy(x).
We know supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), so we can't derive the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).

So E is a possible relation between x and z.

2. NE: For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From the given constraints:
We know supx(y) <= infx(x) but can't derive a guaranteed relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
From supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), we get supy(z) <= infy(x).

So NE is a possible relation between x and z.

3. N: For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From the given constraints:
From supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), we get supy(z) <= infy(x).
From infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y), we can deduce infx(z) <= infx(x).
We can't derive the relation between supx(x) and supx(z).

So N is a possible relation between x and z.

4. NW: For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From the given constraints:
From supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), we get supy(z) <= infy(x).
But from infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), we infer that infx(z) <= infx(x), which is inconsistent with supx(x) <= infx(z).

So NW is not a possible relation between x and z.

5. W: For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From the given constraints:
As with NW, we infer that infx(z) <= infx(x), which is inconsistent with supx(x) <= infx(z).

So W is not a possible relation between x and z.

6. SW: For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From the given constraints:
As with NW and W, we infer that infx(z) <= infx(x), which is inconsistent with supx(x) <= infx(z).

So SW is not a possible relation between x and z.

7. S: For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From the given constraints:
From infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), we infer that infx(z) <= infx(x).
We can't derive the relation between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z).

So S is a possible relation between x and z.

8. SE: For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

From the given constraints:
We can't derive the relation between supx(z) and infx(x) or between supy(x) and infy(z).

So SE is a possible relation between x and z.

9. B: For x B z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From the given constraints:
From infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y), we can deduce infx(z) <= infx(x).
We can't derive the relations between supx(x) and supx(z), between infy(z) and infy(x), or between supy(x) and supy(z).

So B is a possible relation between x and z.

Wait, I think I've been a bit too lenient. Let me reconsider the constraints more rigidly.

The key insight is the transitivity of the constraints. For a relation to be possible, there needs to be a consistent spatial configuration where all constraints are satisfied.

For NW, W, and SW, I've shown that infx(z) <= infx(x) from the given constraints, which directly contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) required for these directions. So NW, W, and SW are not possible.

For the other directions, we need to determine if there exists a configuration where the constraints aren't contradictory.

So, in conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.

Actually, let me verify by drawing a diagram. If x is E of y and y is N of z, then x can be located in a region to the east of y, and z can be located in a region to the south of y. Depending on how much x extends to the east and how much z extends to the east and south, x can be:

1. N of z: if x is directly above z.
2. NE of z: if x is above and to the right of z.
3. E of z: if x is directly to the right of z.
4. SE of z: if x is below and to the right of z.
5. S of z: if x is directly below z.
6. B (the "bounds" region): if z contains x.

For x to be NW, W, or SW of z, z would need to be to the east of x, which contradicts the constraint that x is east of y and y is east of z. So NW, W, and SW are not possible.

But wait — y being N of z means that y is to the north of z, but it doesn't specify the east-west relationship. It's possible for z to extend farther east than y. But since x is east of y, it's guaranteed that the western boundary of x is to the east of the eastern boundary of y. So if z extends far enough to the east, it's still not possible for x to be west of z.

Actually, let me be precise. For x to be W, NW, or SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). From the constraints, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) (because x is E of y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (because y is N of z). This means supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)). But this doesn't guarantee that supx(x) <= infx(z), so W, NW, or SW are not ruled out.

Hmm, I'm confused again. Let's be super precise.

From x E y, we know:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y on the x-axis)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (the southern boundary of x is north of or aligned with the southern boundary of y)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (the northern boundary of x is south of or aligned with the northern boundary of y)

From y N z, we know:
4. supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z on the y-axis)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y) (the western boundary of y is east of or aligned with the western boundary of z)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z) (the eastern boundary of y is west of or aligned with the eastern boundary of z)

For x NW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From 4 and 2, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x).

For supx(x) <= infx(z), we need to see if it's compatible with the other constraints. From 1 and 5, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This means The eastern boundary of y is west of the western boundary of x and the western boundary of z is west of the western boundary of y. this doesn't place a direct constraint on supx(x) and infx(z), so it's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z).

Wait, I need to think more carefully. From 1, we know that the eastern boundary of y is to the west of the western boundary of x (supx(y) <= infx(x)). From 5, we know that the western boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of y (infx(z) <= infx(y)).

If we want to have supx(x) <= infx(z), that means the eastern boundary of x is to the west of the western boundary of z. But from the above, we know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). If we chain these, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). But this implies infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts our goal of supx(x) <= infx(z) (since these two conditions would imply supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction since the western boundary of a region can't be to the west of its eastern boundary).

So, NW, W, and SW are not possible relations between x and z.

For the other directions, we can check if they're compatible with the constraints. I've done this earlier, and N, NE, E, SE, S, and B are possible.

Actually, let's double-check the B relation. For x B z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From 5 and 2, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x). While this doesn't directly confirm infy(z) <= infy(x), it's a possibility.

From 6, we have supx(y) <= supx(z). We also know from 1 that supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't give us a direct constraint on supx(x) and supx(z), but it's possible for supx(x) <= supx(z).

From 3 and 4, we have supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). This means that z's top is below y's bottom, and x's top is below y's top. This arrangement makes it impossible for x's top to be below z's top (since z is below y), which violates the supy(x) <= supy(z) constraint for B.

So, B is not a possible relation between x and z.

Actually, let me think about this carefully. I know from 3 and 4 that supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). Since infy(y) <= supy(y) (bottom of a region must be below or at the top), we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y). This implies supy(z) <= supy(y). Hmm, we also have supy(x) <= supy(y). Since supy(z) <= supy(y) and supy(x) <= supy(y), we can't conclude anything about how supy(x) and supy(z) relate. So, it's possible for supy(x) <= supy(z).

Actually, wait a sec. We have:

supy(z) <= infy(y) (constraint 4)
infy(y) <= supy(y) (by definition)
supy(x) <= supy(y) (constraint 3)

From those constraints, we can't directly determine the relation between supy(x) and supy(z). It could be supy(x) <= supy(z) or supy(z) <= supy(x).

But I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking for the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z. Given the two constraints, we need to explore all possible spatial configurations of x, y, and z and determine which cardinal directions are possible.

From the above analysis, I think the following is true:

- For NW, W, and SW, I've shown that they're not possible due to a contradiction.
- For B, I initially thought it wasn't possible, but upon careful analysis, I can see that there's no direct contradiction, so it's a possibility.
- For N, NE, E, SE, and S, there's no contradiction with the constraints, so they're possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.

Actually, I no longer believe B is a possibility. Let's check:

For x B z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From 4, 2, and 3, we have supy(z) <= infy(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y). That means supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so z's top is below x's bottom. This directly contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z) needed for B.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, and S.

Actually, I was right earlier when I argued that B was not a possibility. So the final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, and S.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to carefully analyze the constraints from the given information.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the definition of E (East):
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's southern boundary is aligned with or north of y's southern boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's northern boundary is aligned with or south of y's northern boundary)

From the definition of N (North):
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's western boundary is aligned with or east of z's western boundary)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's eastern boundary is aligned with or west of z's eastern boundary)

Analyzing possible relations between x and z:

NW, W, SW are impossible because:
- From our constraints, infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- This implies infx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicting the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for these directions

B is impossible because:
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- This means z's top is below x's bottom, contradicting the requirement supy(x) ≤ supy(z) for B

The possible relations are:
N, NE, E, SE, S
