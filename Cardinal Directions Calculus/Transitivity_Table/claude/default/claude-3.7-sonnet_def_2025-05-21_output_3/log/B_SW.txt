PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We know:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's understand what these relations mean using the definitions provided:

x B y means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

This means x is inside the bounding box of y.

y SW z means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means y is to the southwest of z (y is both to the south and to the west of z).

Now, let's see what constraints we can derive for the relationship between x and z.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Let's combine these constraints:

From x B y and y SW z:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This gives us:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which satisfies the constraint for x being to the west of z (x W z, x NW z, or x SW z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which satisfies the constraint for x being to the south of z (x S z, x SW z, or x SE z)

The common constraint is x SW z.

Let's double-check:

x SW z means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These constraints are indeed satisfied based on our derivation.

So, the relation between x and z is x SW z.

Actually, I need to be more careful here. The above analysis assumed that the boundaries are tight, but I need to consider the possible positions of region x within region y more carefully.

Let's reconsider. We have:
- x B y: x is inside the bounding box of y
- y SW z: y is to the southwest of z

The constraints on x and z are:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

These constraints imply that x is to the left of and below z, which could correspond to the relation x SW z.

However, since x is inside the bounding box of y, and y is to the southwest of z, x could be positioned in various ways within y's bounding box, leading to different relations with z.

Let's consider all possibilities:

If x takes up the entire bounding box of y, then x SW z.

If x is located in the northwestern part of y's bounding box, then x could be to the west of z (x W z).

If x is located in the southwestern part of y's bounding box, then x could be to the southwest of z (x SW z).

If x is located in the southeastern part of y's bounding box, then x could still be to the southwest of z (as long as supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).

Wait, I think I'm making an error in my reasoning. Let me take a step back.

We have:
- x B y: x is inside the bounding box of y
- y SW z: y is to the southwest of z

Let's think about the possible positions of region x relative to region z.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): x is to the left of z
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is below z

Let me now check which cardinal direction relations satisfy these constraints.

For relation x SW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
This is satisfied by our constraints, so x SW z is possible.

For relation x W z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
But we know supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
So, x W z is not possible.

For relation x S z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
But we know supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
So, x S z is not possible.

Let's continue checking for other cardinal direction relations:

For relation x B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
But we know supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
So, x B z is not possible.

For relation x NW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
But we know infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
So, x NW z is not possible.

For relation x N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
But we know infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
Also, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
So, x N z is not possible.

For relation x NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
But we know infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
Also, infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
So, x NE z is not possible.

For relation x E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
But we know infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
Also, infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
So, x E z is not possible.

For relation x SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
But we know infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
So, x SE z is not possible.

Based on the analysis, it seems like x SW z is the only possible relation between x and z.

Wait, let me double-check this. I'm concerned I might be making an error because the bounding box of x could be a subset of the bounding box of y.

Actually, I think the issue is that I'm not considering the case where x could be a proper subset of y's bounding box. If x is significantly smaller than y and is positioned in a specific part of y, then other relations between x and z could be possible.

Let's revisit the problem. We have:
- x B y: x is inside the bounding box of y
- y SW z: y is to the southwest of z

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Hmm wait, I think I need to reconsider what the relationship "x B y" means. Let's consult the definition again.

According to the definition, "a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)".

So, for x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

This means x is within the bounding box of y. It doesn't mean that x has to take up the entire bounding box of y.

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these constraints, we get:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): x is to the left of z
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is below z

Now, let's check which cardinal direction relations satisfy these constraints.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
This is satisfied by our constraints, so x SW z is possible.

Hmm, but the thing is, we don't have constraints on all aspects of the relationship between x and z. For example, we don't know the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z), or between infy(x) and infy(z).

Let me think about the possible positions of x relative to z.

We know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): x is to the left of z
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is below z

This means x could be in the SW, W, S, or B positions relative to z, depending on the exact positions of x and z.

Let's check each of these possibilities.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
This is satisfied by our constraints.

For x W z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies supy(x) < infy(z) for non-overlapping regions. This contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x) for non-overlapping regions.
However, if infy(z) = infy(x) and supy(x) = infy(z), then x would just touch z at a point, which might not qualify as a strict W relation.
But I think we're dealing with general regions, not just points, so I'm going to say x W z is not possible.

For x S z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) < infx(z) for non-overlapping regions. This contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x) for non-overlapping regions.
So, I'm going to say x S z is not possible.

For x B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) < infx(z) for non-overlapping regions. This contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x) for non-overlapping regions.
So, I'm going to say x B z is not possible.

Hmm, actually wait. I think I've been mixing up the definitions. Let me be more careful.

For a SW b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

For a W b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)

For a S b:
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a), and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

For a B b:
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)

Now, let's check which cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with the constraints we have.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
This is satisfied by our constraints.

For x W z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
So, x W z is not possible.

For x S z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
So, x S z is not possible.

For x B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
So, x B z is not possible.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
So, x NW z is not possible.

For x N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
Also, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
So, x N z is not possible.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
Also, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
So, x NE z is not possible.

For x E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
Also, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
So, x E z is not possible.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (assuming they don't overlap).
So, x SE z is not possible.

From this analysis, it seems like x SW z is the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z.

One I think about it more though, I realize that I've been thinking of strict inequalities. But these are not guaranteed to be strict, it could also be infy(z) = infy(x), leading to a touching scenario rather than overlap. Let's carefully revisit the problem.

We know:
- x B y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This gives us:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

So, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Both are satisfied, so x SW z is possible.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given supy(x) ≤ infy(z), for x W z to be possible, we'd need infy(z) ≤ infy(x). 
But this would mean infy(z) = infy(x) and supy(x) = infy(z), which is a special touching scenario. 
In general, for regions, this doesn't seem plausible, so x W z is not a valid possibility.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), for x S z to be possible, we'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x). 
But this would mean infx(z) = infx(x) and supx(x) = infx(z), which is a special touching scenario. 
In general, for regions, this doesn't seem plausible, so x S z is not a valid possibility.

Let's me continue to evaluate other possible cardinal directions.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), for x B z to be possible, we'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x). 
But this would mean infx(z) = infx(x) and supx(x) = infx(z), which is a special touching scenario. 
In general, for regions, this doesn't seem plausible, so x B z is not a valid possibility.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Given supy(x) ≤ infy(z), for x NW z to be possible, we'd need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). 
But this would mean supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is a contradictory unless x and z are widely separated or in certain special configurations.
In general, for regions, this doesn't seem plausible, so x NW z is not a valid possibility.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), for x N z to be possible, we'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x). 
But this would mean infx(z) = infx(x) and supx(x) = infx(z), which is a special touching scenario.
Also, given supy(x) ≤ infy(z), for x N z to be possible, we'd need supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
But this would mean supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is contradictory.
So, x N z is not a valid possibility.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), for x NE z to be possible, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). 
But this would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which is contradictory.
So, x NE z is not a valid possibility.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), for x E z to be possible, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). 
But this would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which is contradictory.
So, x E z is not a valid possibility.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), for x SE z to be possible, we'd need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). 
But this would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which is contradictory.
So, x SE z is not a valid possibility.

After evaluating all cardinal direction relations, it seems that x SW z is the only valid possibility.

Let me think about this one more time. Specifically, I need to think more clearly about the case where the regions can touch, but not overlap.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Both are satisfied, so x SW z is valid.

For x W z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

We have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The last constraint we need to check is infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

I think I've been thinking about things incorrectly. I've been assuming that if a region is in the W position, it can't also be in the S position. But these are not mutually exclusive. A region can be both to the west and to the south of another region (which would make it to the southwest).

Ok, actually, I think it's more helpful to think visually. If z is fixed, we want to know the possible positions of x.

We're told that x is within y's bounding box, and y is to the southwest of z. This constrains x to be within y's bounding box, which is entirely to the southwest of z. So, x must be to the southwest of z, meaning x SW z is the only valid possibility.

Actually, let's be more careful about the problem description. We have:
- x B y: x is inside the bounding box of y
- y SW z: y is to the southwest of z

Let me redo the full analysis and check the possible cardinal directions. 

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining, we get:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This implies:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's check all the cardinal direction relations between x and z:

For x B z:
We need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
But we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x) if they are distinct (no overlap).
So, x B z is not valid.

Actually, I'm realizing the reason for my confusion. I'm considering regions, not points. Regions have width, which means, for example, that if a is to the west of b, then supx(a) < infx(b) (strict inequality).

Let me correct my reasoning:

For x B z:
We need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
But we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) < infx(z) for regions that don't overlap.
This contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
So, x B z is not valid.

For x S z:
We need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
But we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) < infx(z) for regions that don't overlap.
This contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
So, x S z is not valid.

For x SW z:
We need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
Both are satisfied, so x SW z is valid.

For x W z:
We need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
But we have supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which implies supy(x) < infy(z) for regions that don't overlap.
This contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
So, x W z is not valid.

For x NW z:
We need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
But we have supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which implies supy(x) < infy(z) for regions that don't overlap.
If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then infy(x) > supy(z) ≥ infy(z) > supy(x), which implies infy(x) > supy(x).
This contradicts the basic property of regions, where infy(x) ≤ supy(x).
So, x NW z is not valid.

Ah, I see the issue. I've been making an interpretation error. Let's be clear that in the context of these types of problems, regions can in general touch (i.e. have boundaries in common), as long as their interiors don't overlap. So, we can have situations where supx(a) = infx(b), which means regions a and b touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Ok, let me re-evaluate:

For x SW z:
We need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
Both are satisfied, so x SW z is valid.

For x W z:
We need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
Given supy(x) ≤ infy(z), for x W z to be valid, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which results in supy(x) = infy(z) = infy(x) (the regions touch).
Since regions must have non-empty interiors, this scenario is unlikely.
So, x W z is not valid.

For x S z:
We need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), for x S z to be valid, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which results in supx(x) = infx(z) = infx(x) (the regions touch).
Since regions must have non-empty interiors, this scenario is unlikely.
So, x S z is not valid.

For x B z:
We need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), for x B z to be valid, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which results in supx(x) = infx(z) = infx(x) (the regions touch).
Since regions must have non-empty interiors, this scenario is unlikely.
So, x B z is not valid.

Hmm, this doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Actually, I've been thinking about a and b when I should have been thinking about x, y, and z. Let me recalibrate.

The regions in the problem are given to be in REG, which means they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This implies they are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries.

Now, let's re-evaluate the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, given that x B y and y SW z.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's check each cardinal direction relation from the definition:
For x SW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
Both are satisfied, so x SW z is a valid possibility.

For x W z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
But we have supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x) for regions without intersections. So, x W z is not valid.

For x S z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
But we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x) for regions without intersections. So, x S z is not valid.

For x B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
But we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x) for regions without intersections. So, x B z is not valid.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
But we have supy(x) ≤ infy(z). For regions without intersections, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) implies infy(x) > supy(z) ≥ infy(z) > supy(x), which is a contradiction. So, x NW z is not valid.

For x N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
But we have supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z), both leading to contradictions for regions without intersections. So, x N z is not valid.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
But we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for regions without intersections. So, x NE z is not valid.

For x E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
But we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), both leading to contradictions for regions without intersections. So, x E z is not valid.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
But we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for regions without intersections. So, x SE z is not valid.

After careful evaluation, it seems that x SW z is the only valid cardinal direction relation between x and z.

On second thought, I think I'm thinking too hard on this problem and overcomplicating things.

We're given:
- x B y: x is inside the bounding box of y.
- y SW z: y is to the southwest of z.

If x is inside the bounding box of y, and y is to the southwest of z, then x is to the southwest of z. This is because the bounding box of y is to the southwest of z, so anything inside that bounding box (including x) will also be to the southwest of z.

So, the possible relation between x and z is x SW z.

Actually, let me double-check my thinking. It's possible that the way I've been interpreting the problem is restrictive, and the actual problem admits more possibilities.

To be safe, let me just consider the definitions of "x B y" and "y SW z" again, and then deduce what these definitions tell us about the possible positions of x relative to z.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

This means x is inside the bounding box of y. It doesn't mean that x has to take up the entire bounding box of y.

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means y is to the southwest of z. The bounding box of y is to the southwest of the bounding box of z.

Combining these constraints, we get:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's check which relations between x and z are consistent with these constraints:

For x SW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
Both are satisfied from our constraints, so x SW z is a possible relation.

For x W z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
The first constraint is satisfied. The second constraint, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) for regions without intersections. So, x W z is not a possible relation.

For x S z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
The first and third constraints are satisfied. The second constraint, infx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicts infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) for regions without intersections. So, x S z is not a possible relation.

For x B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
The second and fourth constraints are satisfied. The first constraint, infx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicts infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) for regions without intersections. The third constraint, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) for regions without intersections. So, x B z is not a possible relation.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
The first constraint is satisfied. The second constraint, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) for regions without intersections. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then supy(z) < infy(x) (for regions without intersections). But we also have infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z). Thus, supy(z) < infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z), which is a contradiction. So, x NW z is not a possible relation.

For x N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
The third constraint is satisfied. The first constraint, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z) for regions without intersections, as explained in the previous check. The second constraint, infx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicts infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) for regions without intersections. So, x N z is not a possible relation.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
The first constraint, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicts infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) for regions without intersections. The second constraint, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), also leads to a contradiction as explained in the previous checks. So, x NE z is not a possible relation.

For x E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
The third constraint is satisfied. The first constraint, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicts infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) for regions without intersections. The second constraint, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) for regions without intersections. So, x E z is not a possible relation.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
The second constraint is satisfied. The first constraint, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicts infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) for regions without intersections. So, x SE z is not a possible relation.

Therefore, after a thorough check, I conclude that x SW z is the only valid cardinal direction relation between x and z.

Actually wait. Let me think about the problem again more carefully. Let me double check the definition of the B direction (bounding box). "a B b" means that a is inside the bounding box of b. 

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

This is correct. x is inside y's bounding box.

For y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

y is to the southwest of z.

Combining these constraints, we get:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From the above, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These are precisely the constraints for x SW z.

So, the possible relation between x and z is x SW z.

To check against potential misunderstanding, let me verify if this holds for all possible positions of x within y's bounding box. The maximum bounds for x are defined by y's bounding box. Even if x is at the furthest possible position from z (i.e., at the northeast corner of y's bounding box), it would still satisfy the constraints for being to the southwest of z.

So, I'm confident that x SW z is the only possible relation between x and z.

Actually, I noticed something. We're working with regions, not just points or bounding boxes.

Let's be sure we're understanding the cardinal direction relations correctly. From the problem definition:

A single-tile cardinal direction relation B (bounding box), S (South), SW (South West), W (West), NW (North West), N (North), NE (North East), E (East) and SE (South East) is defined as follows: ...

And then the detail for the SW relationship: "a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)".

This means that for a to be in the SW relation with b, the entire region a must be to the southwest of b.

Now, let's consider our problem. We know:
- x B y: x is inside the bounding box of y.
- y SW z: y is to the southwest of z.

From y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

So, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These are the constraints for x SW z.

Let me quickly double-check this one more time to ensure I haven't made any mistakes.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

From x B y and y SW z, we derived:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

So, the constraints for x SW z are satisfied.

Let me quickly check for x B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

But we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x B z is not valid.

Let me check for x W z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

But we have supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x W z is not valid.

Let me check for x S z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

But we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x S z is not valid.

Alright, after checking multiple possible relations, it seems my original conclusion is correct: the only valid relation between x and z is x SW z.

But wait, I wonder if I'm making a mistake in interpretation. Let's revisit the question:

"If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

The question asks for possible relations, not the certain relation. It's possible that there's ambiguity, and multiple relations could be valid.

But based on my analysis, given the constraints of x B y and y SW z, only x SW z emerges as the valid relation between x and z.

However, let's double-check once more. What if x takes up only a small part of y's bounding box? Could x be in a relation other than SW with z?

Let's see:
- From x B y, x must be inside y's bounding box.
- From y SW z, the entire region y (and consequently its bounding box) must be to the southwest of z.

So, no matter where or how small x is within y's bounding box, it will always be to the southwest of z.

I'm confident that the relation between x and z is SW.

Given the constraints of x B y and y SW z, the only valid relation between x and z is x SW z.

Just to be absolutely sure, let's look at the definition from the problem statement:

"a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)"

This means that a is in the SW relation with b if the supremum x-coordinate of a is less than or equal to the infimum x-coordinate of b, and the supremum y-coordinate of a is less than or equal to the infimum y-coordinate of b. In simpler terms, a is to the southwest of b.

Given x B y and y SW z, we've shown that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These are precisely the constraints for x SW z.

So, the possible relation between x and z is x SW z.

So, my final answer is that given x B y and y SW z, the possible relation between x and z is SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This gives us:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These constraints exactly match the definition of SW relation. Any region x that satisfies the original constraints will always be southwest of region z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is:

SW
