PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this carefully.

First, we have: x is NW of y.
By the definition of NW relation: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

Second, we have: y is NW of z.
By the definition of NW relation: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, let's derive the possible relationships between x and z.

From the inequalities above, we know:
supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
So, supx(x) <= infx(z)

And:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
So, supy(z) <= infy(x)

Now, what does supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) imply?

Looking at the definitions:
- For NW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- For N: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- For W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- For SW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- For NE: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- For S: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- For E: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- For SE: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- For B: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

From the derived inequalities, we have:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

These inequalities match the definition of NW. So, one possible relationship is that region x is NW of region z. 

Let's check other possibilities. The inequalities we derived don't provide information about the relative positions of infx(x) and infx(z), or supy(x) and supy(z). So, there might be other possible relationships.

I need to be more systematic. Let's consider all the possible cardinal directions and see which ones are consistent with our derived constraints:

1. NW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
   - We've shown that supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), which matches the NW definition. So, x can be NW of z.

2. N: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
   - We've shown that supy(z) <= infy(x), which is consistent with the first condition.
   - But, we don't have information about the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z). So, we can't confirm or refute N.

Wait, let's analyze this more carefully. We are given:
x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

I've inferred:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

For the N relation between x and z, we need:
supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've derived)
infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

But, we derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= supx(z) (since infx(z) <= supx(z) by definition). However, it contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) unless infx(z) = infx(x), which is a special case. So, in general, x cannot be N of z.

Let's continue with the other cardinal directions.

3. NE: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
   - We've shown that supy(z) <= infy(x), which matches the second condition.
   - But, for the first condition, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). However, we derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= supx(z) (since infx(z) <= supx(z)). Unless supx(z) = supx(x), which is a special case, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is unlikely to be satisfied. So, in general, x cannot be NE of z.

4. E: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
   - For the first condition, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). As discussed above, this is unlikely based on our derived relationships unless it's a special case.
   - So, in general, x cannot be E of z.

5. SE: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
   - For the first condition, we need supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For the second condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Based on our derived relationships, these are unlikely to be satisfied generally. So, x is generally not SE of z.

6. S: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
   - For the first condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Given our derived relationships, this isn't guaranteed. So, x is not generally S of z.

7. SW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
   - For the first condition, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), which we've derived.
   - For the second condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Given the constraint supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), it implies supy(z) <= infy(x). But we don't have direct information about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, it's possible for x to be SW of z, but it's not guaranteed based on the given constraints.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. I should consider the possible configurations in a 2D coordinate system.

Given x is NW of y, x is in the area where both x-coordinates are less than any x-coordinate of y, and all y-coordinates of x are more than the highest y-coordinate of y.

Similarly, given y is NW of z, y is in the area where all x-coordinates of y are less than any x-coordinate of z, and all y-coordinates of y are more than the highest y-coordinate of z.

Combining these, x is in a region where all its x-coordinates are less than any x-coordinate of y, which in turn are less than any x-coordinate of z. Also, all y-coordinates of z are less than the highest y-coordinate of y, which in turn are less than any y-coordinate of x.

So, x is in a region where all its x-coordinates are less than any x-coordinate of z, and all y-coordinates of z are less than any y-coordinate of x. This configuration satisfies the definition of the NW cardinal direction.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NW.

Hmm, I think I've been overcomplicating. Let's approach it one more time to be sure.

Given:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Transitivity for x-coordinates:
supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
So, supx(x) <= infx(z)

Transitivity for y-coordinates:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
So, supy(z) <= infy(x)

Now, checking the definitions of cardinal directions again:

1. NW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
   The derived inequalities match this definition: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x is NW of z.

Actually, wait. Let me think about this more carefully. From the two given NW relations, I've derived supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), which indeed matches the NW definition.

But, are there other possible relations between x and z?

For example, could x be "purely" north of z? For that, we would need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The third condition might be satisfied, but the second condition contradicts our derived inequality (supx(x) <= infx(z)) unless infx(z) = infx(x). So, x is generally not purely north of z.

Similarly, I can check other directions. But I'm confident now that NW is the relation between x and z.

Actually, I think I should re-check W as well:

W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- We've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which satisfies the first condition.
- We need infy(z) <= infy(x), which isn't guaranteed from our derived inequalities. So, x is not necessarily W of z.

Actually, I'm not being clear here. Let me rethink this, especially from a 2D perspective.

If x is NW of y, it means x is in the region to the north and west of y. 
If y is NW of z, it means y is in the region to the north and west of z.

If we consider a 2D coordinate system, x would be in a region where its x-coordinates are less than the leftmost x-coordinate of y, and its y-coordinates are greater than the topmost y-coordinate of y. Similarly, y would be in a region where its x-coordinates are less than the leftmost x-coordinate of z, and its y-coordinates are greater than the topmost y-coordinate of z.

This means x is in a region where its x-coordinates are less than the leftmost x-coordinate of z (through transitivity), and its y-coordinates are greater than the topmost y-coordinate of z (again through transitivity). This configuration aligns with the NW direction.

So, the relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, let me understand this differently.

Based on the definitions, if a region is NW of another, it means it is in the northwest sector of a 9-sector grid where the other region is the reference. Given that x is NW of y and y is NW of z, I can infer that x is even further northwest in relation to z than it is to y. This should suggest that x is also NW of z.

Let me verify with the mathematical definitions provided:

For a region a to be NW of a region b, the conditions are:
- supx(a) <= infx(b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a)

Given:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Transitively:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z)

And:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x)

These conditions match the definition of NW, confirming that x is NW of z. I believe this is the correct answer. The possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

Actually, let me re-read the definitions more carefully and make sure I understand the problem correctly. The problem asks for the "possible relations", so it might be asking for all possible cardinal directions, not just the most obvious one.

Let me double-check. If x is NW of y, then we're constraining the position of x to the northwest of y. Similarly, if y is NW of z, we're constraining the position of y to the northwest of z. The question asks for the possible relations between x and z.

Recall the derived inequalities:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

I need to see which cardinal directions these inequalities permit.

N: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
For x to be N of z, we would need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The second condition contradicts our derived inequality (supx(x) <= infx(z)) unless infx(z) = infx(x). And if infx(z) = infx(x), then supx(x) <= infx(z) = infx(x) which would mean supx(x) <= infx(x), which is generally impossible for a non-empty region. So, x is not N of z.

Actually, I need to revisit this. If infx(z) = infx(x), it wouldn't necessarily mean supx(x) <= infx(x) because these are separate conditions. It would just mean that the leftmost points of x and z align. In such a configuration, x could still be N of z if its rightmost point is not further right than the rightmost point of z.

So, if the leftmost points of x and z align (infx(z) = infx(x)) and the rightmost point of x is not further right than the rightmost point of z (supx(x) <= supx(z)), then x can be N of z.

It feels more coherent to try to determine this with precise figures. Imagine three regions, x, y, and z, such that x is NW of y and y is NW of z:
```
        x           
                    
                    
                    
                   y 
                    
                    
                                   z
```

Clearly, x is NW of z. But could there be a configuration where x is N of z? It would look something like:
```
        x           
                    
                    
                    
                   y 
                    
                    
        z          
```

But in this case, it's not true that y is NW of z. So, it seems like if x is NW of y and y is NW of z, then x can only be NW of z.

What about other possibilities, like W?

W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
For x to be W of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's see if the last two conditions are compatible with our derived inequality (supy(z) <= infy(x)). If infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is true for any non-empty region), we have infy(z) <= supy(x). And if supy(x) <= supy(z), we have infy(z) <= supy(z). But this is true for any non-empty region z. So, the compatibility doesn't provide additional constraints.

However, the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived inequalities means there's a vertical gap between x and z, with x being above z. This is indeed consistent with the NW relationship but not with a pure W relationship where there's no vertical separation.

Let me try another visualization:
```
        x           
                    
                    
                   y 
                    
                    
                                   z
```

In this, x is NW of y, y is NW of z, and x is NW of z.

To make x be W of z, we'd need:
```
                    
         x          
                    
                   y 
                    
                    
         z                      
```

But again, this violates the constraint that y is NW of z.

Let's check other directions too:

SW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
For x to be SW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The second condition contradicts our derived inequality (supy(z) <= infy(x)) unless infy(z) = supy(x). But in that case, x and z would be touching at a point, which doesn't maintain the "SW" relationship in the strictest sense.

NE: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
For x to be NE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have)

Again, the first condition contradicts our derived inequality.

Similar contradictions can be found for the other cardinal directions: E, SE, S.

What about B?

B: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
For x to be B of z (i.e., x inside the bounding box of z), we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The first condition contradicts our derived inequality unless infx(z) = infx(x), but as I argued above, this might be a special case and would be handled with one of the other cardinal directions from the constraint.

So, after a thorough analysis, I believe the relation between x and z is solely NW.

Alright, let me double-check again.

Given:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, I've derived:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Looking at the definitions of the cardinal directions:

B: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

N: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

NE: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

E: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

SE: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

S: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

SW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

NW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

Which of these are compatible with our derived inequalities?

Let's examine the definitions for a region a in relation to a region b, then replace a with x and b with z to check if the conditions are compatible:

For x to be B of z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The first condition contradicts our derived inequality (supx(x) <= infx(z)) because a non-empty region's supremum is always greater than its infimum. So, x is not B of z.

For x to be N of z, we would need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The second condition contradicts our derived inequality, so x is not N of z.

For x to be NE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have)

The first condition contradicts our derived inequality, so x is not NE of z.

For x to be E of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The first condition contradicts our derived inequality, so x is not E of z.

For x to be SE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The first condition contradicts our derived inequality, and the second condition contradicts our other derived inequality, so x is not SE of z.

For x to be S of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The first condition contradicts our derived inequality, so x is not S of z.

For x to be SW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The second condition contradicts our derived inequality, so x is not SW of z.

For x to be W of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The second condition implies that every y-coordinate of z, down to the minimum, is less than the minimum y-coordinate of x. But our derived inequality states that the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than the minimum y-coordinate of x. This means z is strictly below x in the y-direction.

So, while we have the condition "supx(x) <= infx(z)" which fits with a W relation, the constraint "supy(z) <= infy(x)" implies a strict separation along the y-axis, which contradicts the idea of a pure W relation where there's overlap in the y-direction. Therefore, x is not W of z.

For x to be NW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have)

Both conditions align with our derived inequalities. Therefore, x is NW of z.

From the above, we see that only the NW relation fits the derived constraints. So, the relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I need to correct my reasoning. I've re-derived the conditions from the problem statement and verified that the answer is indeed NW, but I want to clarify that "supy(z) <= infy(x)" doesn't necessarily contradict a pure W relation, as I incorrectly stated before.  It's just that for a pure W relation, we also need conditions like infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which isn't explicitly derivable from the problem. There's a specific configuration where regions can be such that x is W of z (not NW). However, given the constraints of the problem, x is guaranteed to be NW of z.

Actually, wait. I think there's a subtle issue with my reasoning. I need to double check that the conditions I've been using for W.

W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Translating to x and z, for x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The second condition requires that the minimum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x. This is not derivable from the problem's constraints. However, it's also not explicitly contradicted by our derived inequality (supy(z) <= infy(x)), which only says that the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x.

If supy(z) < infy(x), there's a vertical gap between the regions, with x strictly above z. This is consistent with a NW relation, not a W relation.

But what if supy(z) = infy(x)? In this case, x and z touch at a point or along a segment where the bottom of x touches the top of z. This is a special case, and while it doesn't fully satisfy the condition for a pure W relation, it's a boundary case.

However, for a true W relation, we need x and z to have overlap or at least touch in the y-direction, and x to be to the left of z in the x-direction. Given our derived inequalities, it's possible for x to be W of z if:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already derived)
- infy(z) = infy(x)
- supy(x) = supy(z)

But this is a very specific configuration, and it still needs to satisfy the other constraint that y is NW of z.

Similarly, for x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already derived)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (already derived)

In general, all we can conclude is that x is NW of z. Hmm, I made a mistake: if supy(z) = infy(x), then x and z are touching only at the point and there's no overlap along the y-direction, so it's still NW rather than W.

Alright, I need to restate what our derived inequalities mean geometrically in the 2D coordinate system.

supx(x) <= infx(z) means that the furthest right point of region x is to the left of the leftmost point of region z. This places x strictly to the left of z in the x-direction.

supy(z) <= infy(x) means that the highest point of region z is below the lowest point of region x. This places x strictly above z in the y-direction.

Given these geometric interpretations, x is in the northwest direction from z, without any overlap in either the x or y direction. This is the definition of a NW relation.

So, the relation between x and z is unequivocally NW.

Actually, I don't think I've been careful enough. Let me revisit this problem to ensure I provide the correct answer.

Given:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, I derive:
supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
So, supx(x) <= infx(z)

And:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
So, supy(z) <= infy(x)

These two inequalities ensure that x is in the northwest direction from z.

Let's check if any other cardinal direction is possible:

B (bounding box): For x to be within the bounding box of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) <= infx(z), so x is not B of z.

N (North): For x to be north of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x). The last condition is satisfied, but the first condition contradicts our derived inequality, so x is not N of z.

NE (North East): For x to be northeast of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The second condition is satisfied, but the first contradicts our derived inequality, so x is not NE of z.

E (East): For x to be east of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition contradicts our derived inequality, so x is not E of z.

SE (South East): For x to be southeast of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition contradicts our derived inequality, and the second is at odds with our second derived inequality, so x is not SE of z.

S (South): For x to be south of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition contradicts our first derived inequality, and the third is at odds with our second derived inequality, so x is not S of z.

SW (South West): For x to be southwest of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition is satisfied, but the second is at odds with our second derived inequality, so x is not SW of z.

W (West): For x to be west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is satisfied. However, the constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) from our second derived inequality means that the entire region z is below the entire region x in the y-direction. This is in conflict with the idea of a pure W relation, where there should be some overlap (or at least touching) in the y-direction. So, in general, x is not W of z.

NW (North West): For x to be northwest of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these conditions are satisfied by our derived inequalities, so x is NW of z.

From the analysis, the relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I think that "x is NW of z" is the only possible answer.

Let me re-read the problem statement, especially the definition of "cardinal direction relation." It's defined as an expression R1: ... : Rk, where R1, ..., Rk are from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

From this, it appears that a region can have multiple cardinal direction relations with respect to a reference region. This has implications for our problem, since I've been focusing on determining the singular relation that x has with z.

However, the definitions of the cardinal directions are mutually exclusive for regions in REG (which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk). If a region is in the NW sector with respect to a reference region, it cannot be in the N sector or the W sector at the same time, unless it spans multiple sectors, which isn't the case for regions in REG.

Given the derived inequalities, x is unequivocally in the NW sector with respect to z, and cannot be in any other sector.

So, the relation between x and z is exclusively NW.

Actually, I realized I've been dealing with the question incorrectly. Let me read the problem statement again.

If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

The problem is not asking for a singular relation, but rather for possible relations. Given my analysis above, the only possible relation between x and z is NW, assuming we're working with the standard cardinal directions.

Therefore, the answer to the question is: NW.

Actually I should be very precise here. Let's recall the definition of the NW cardinal direction, as stated in the problem:

NW: The region a is NW of the region b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

For our problem:
- x is NW of y means supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y is NW of z means supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y).

I've derived:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). So, supx(x) <= infx(z).
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). So, supy(z) <= infy(x).

Using these, I can check if x can be in any of the cardinal directions relative to z:

B: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b).
For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the premise that region is not empty.

S: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), and supx(a) <= supx(b).
For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the premise that infx(z) <= infx(x) since a non-empty region's supremum is greater than its infimum.

SW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we've derived supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the premise that supy(x) <= infy(z) unless supy(x) = infy(z) = supy(z), which would make z a flat line. If z is flat in the y-direction, it's a special case. But since we're working with regions in REG (which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk), we don't have this caveat.

W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b).
For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've derived supy(z) <= infy(x), which says there's a vertical gap between x and z, with x being strictly above z. This contradicts the premise that there's some overlap or touching in the y-direction for a W relation.

N: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), and supx(a) <= supx(b).
For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the premise that infx(z) <= infx(x) for a similar reason as with the S direction.

NE: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have). But we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= supx(z). This contradicts the premise that supx(z) <= infx(x) unless supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x), which would make both x and z flat in the x-direction. Again, since we're working with regions in REG, this is not a generalizable case.

E: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b).
For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But our derived inequality contradicts the first condition for similar reasons as with the NE direction.

SE: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both of these are contradicted by our derived inequalities, as explained earlier.

NW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've derived both of these conditions, confirming that x is NW of z.

From the analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Therefore, the answer is that region x is NW of region z.

Hmm… wait a second. Let me consider the case where infx(z) = supx(x). From the derived inequality supx(x) <= infx(z), this is possible. In this case, x and z would be touching at the boundary in the x-direction.

Similarly, let's consider the case where supy(z) = infy(x). From the derived inequality supy(z) <= infy(x), this is also possible. In this case, x and z would be touching at the boundary in the y-direction.

If both of these conditions hold, x and z would be touching at a single point in the 2D space. This doesn't change the fact that x is NW of z, because the conditions supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) are still satisfied.

So, even with this edge case, the relation between x and z is NW.

Hmm, wait. In the case I described where infx(z) = supx(x) and supy(z) = infy(x), x and z would be touching at a corner. This position would not change the cardinal direction relationship, as the criteria for NW would still be met.

I'm confident that the answer is NW.

Actually, I think I've been unnecessarily complicating things. Let me revisit the problem one more time.

Given:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, I derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (via transitivity)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (via transitivity)

These derived inequalities match the definition of NW: x is NW of z.

Now, I need to check if any other cardinal direction is also possible. I've already done a thorough analysis and found that none of the other cardinal directions are compatible with our derived inequalities.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is exclusively NW.

The answer is NW.

ANSWER:

Looking at the definitions and constraints:

When region x is NW of region y, this means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is entirely to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of y)

Similarly, when region y is NW of region z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is entirely to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is entirely to the north of z)

Through transitivity:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), therefore supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), therefore supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These derived constraints (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) exactly match the definition of the NW relation.

None of the other cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B) are possible because they would require conditions that contradict our derived constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.
