PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We are given that:
- Region x is S (South) of region y. So x S y.
- Region y is S (South) of region z. So y S z.

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions given:
- x S y if and only if supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y S z if and only if supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's derive what we can about the relation between x and z:

From x S y, we have:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y S z, we have:
4. supy(y) <= infy(z)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these, we can derive:
- From 2 and 5, we get: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). So, infx(z) <= infx(x)
- From 3 and 6, we get: supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). So, supx(x) <= supx(z)
- From 1 and 4, we get: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z). So, supy(x) <= infy(z)

Now, let's check which cardinal direction relation(s) these conditions satisfy for x and z:

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied from our derivation)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

So, x can be S of z.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

The first condition might or might not be satisfied. It depends on the exact positions of the regions. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x can be SW of z. Otherwise, it can't.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

The first condition contradicts our derived condition: infx(z) <= infx(x). In the first condition, we have infx(x) > supx(z), but from our derivation, we have infx(x) >= infx(z). Since a region's infimum is always less than or equal to its supremum (infx(z) <= supx(z)), this condition can't be satisfied.

Let's check the conditions for x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied from our derivation)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (satisfied from our derivation)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The second two conditions don't align with our derivation. We know that supy(x) <= infy(z), and generally infy(z) <= supy(z). But we don't have information about the relation between infy(x) and infy(z).

Based on our analysis, I can say that x can definitely be S of z. Depending on the specific positions of the regions, x might also be SW of z.

But wait, let me think more carefully. Let's revisit the definition and check all possible relations.

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied from our derivation)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

All conditions are satisfied. So, x can be S of z.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

The first condition doesn't necessarily follow from our derivations. We know supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), but we don't know the relation between supx(x) and infx(z).

Actually, let's double check that "we derive the relation between supx(x) and infx(z)." I made an error. We only know:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). So, supx(x) <= supx(z).
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). So, infx(z) <= infx(x).

We don't necessarily know if supx(x) <= infx(z). This relation depends on the specific regions.

So, for x SW z, the first condition isn't guaranteed.

Let me try to think differently. Since x is South of y and y is South of z, we can visualize this: z is northmost, y is in the middle, and x is southmost.

Since both relations are "South", there's no East-West shift. This suggests that x and z are roughly aligned in the East-West direction, but with x being further South than z.

Given the definitions, for x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The first condition is satisfied because if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x is definitely South of z.

The second and third conditions depend on how the projections of the regions on the x-axis overlap. But from our derivations, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which satisfy the conditions for x S z.

So, based on the given information, x is S of z.

But wait, I realized I might have been thinking too narrowly. Let me analyze this problem more comprehensively. Given the cardinal direction definitions, we need to check all possible relations between x and z.

From the conditions we've derived:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's revisit all the cardinal direction relations and see which ones x and z can satisfy:

For x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (satisfied)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Since we're told y is South of z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x S y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z). 

The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x), because if infy(z) <= infy(x), then infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, x can't be B of z.

Now, after this more comprehensive analysis, it's clear that only x S z is guaranteed based on the given constraints.

But actually, I realize I haven't checked all the possible cardianl directions, let me do so one by one.

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied from our derivation)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

All conditions are satisfied. So, x can be S of z.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

We don't know if supx(x) <= infx(z) from our derivations. So, x can be SW of z if this additional condition is met.

For x W z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The first condition isn't guaranteed from our derivations. The second condition contradicts what we know: if supy(x) <= infy(z), then infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which means infy(x) <= infy(z), contradicting infy(z) <= infy(x).

So, x can't be W of z.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

The first condition isn't guaranteed. The second condition contradicts what we know: supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which means supy(x) <= infy(x), a contradiction because infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region.

So, x can't be NW of z.

For x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied from our derivation)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

The first condition contradicts what we know, as shown in the NW case.

So, x can't be N of z.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

The first condition contradicts what we know: infx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= supx(z) (for any region). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which agrees with what we know. 

But the second condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), contradicts what we know. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which means supy(x) <= infy(x), a contradiction because infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region.

So, x can't be NE of z.

For x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The first condition contradicts what we know: infx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= supx(z) (for any region). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which agrees with what we know.

The second condition contradicts what we know, as shown in the W case.

So, x can't be E of z.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

The first condition contradicts what we know. From the first derivations we know infx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then it's consistent with infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). But our knowledge of the relation between supx(z) and infx(x) isn't constrained.

So, x can be SE of z if the additional condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is met.

Let's do a check. From our derivations, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Based on these, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x S z (if the other conditions are as derived)
- x SW z (if additionally, supx(x) <= infx(z))
- x SE z (if additionally, supx(z) <= infx(x))

But wait, there's a conflict. We know supx(x) <= supx(z). If additionally, supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which means supx(x) <= infx(x). This is a contradiction because infx(x) <= supx(x) for any region.

So, x can't be SE of z.

Given that z is North of y and y is North of x, the most natural interpretation is that x is South of z.

However, there's another possibility. If x is further West than both y and z, x could be SW of z. But this isn't guaranteed by the given conditions.

To summarize, based on the given information, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x S z (guaranteed)
- x SW z (possible, but not guaranteed)

Hmm, I think I need to be more careful with these conditions:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's be more methodical with our approach. Let me use the definitions directly.

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied from our derivation)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

All conditions are satisfied. So, x can be S of z.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

We don't know if supx(x) <= infx(z). From x S y, we know supx(x) <= supx(y). From y S z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y). However, these don't guarantee supx(x) <= infx(z). It's possible, but not guaranteed.

So, x can be SW of z, but it's not guaranteed.

Let's check SE:

For x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

From x S y, we know infx(y) <= infx(x). From y S z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z). We don't have a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). So, it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x), but it's not guaranteed.

So, x can be SE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

Let's do one more check to make sure I get this correct.

The conditions for relation x S z are:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The conditions for relation x SW z are:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The conditions for relation x SE z are:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our derivation based on x S y and y S z, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (derived from supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y) and infy(y) <= infy(z) (implied by supy(y) <= infy(z) from y S z))
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (derived from infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y))
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (derived from supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z))

These satisfied all the conditions for x S z.

The conditions for x SW z are:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

We don't know if supx(x) <= infx(z) from our derivations. It's possible in some cases.

The conditions for x SE z are:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied from our derivation)

We don't know if supx(z) <= infx(x) from our derivations. It's possible in some cases.

Actually, wait, let's think about whether these are actually possible.

For x SW z, we know:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)

For SW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). Can this be satisfied given what we know?
If supx(x) <= supx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), there's no direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z). So, it's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z), but it's not guaranteed.

So, x can be SW of z, but it's not guaranteed.

For x SE z, we know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

For SE, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). Can this be satisfied given what we know?
If infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), there's no direct relation between supx(z) and infx(x). So, it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), but it's not guaranteed.

So, x can be SE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

Actually, let's draw it out to see if that can be true.

Let's represent a region by its bounding box for simplification. We're given that x S y and y S z.

1. x S y means:
   - supy(x) <= infy(y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)

2. y S z means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z)

For simplicity, let's denote inf and sup of a region u in the x-dimension as [u_min_x, u_max_x] and in the y-dimension as [u_min_y, u_max_y]. So, the bounding box of a region u would be [u_min_x, u_max_x, u_min_y, u_max_y].

Given:
- x S y means:
  - x_max_y <= y_min_y
  - y_min_x <= x_min_x
  - x_max_x <= y_max_x

- y S z means:
  - y_max_y <= z_min_y
  - z_min_x <= y_min_x
  - y_max_x <= z_max_x

Let's say:
- Region x has bounding box [4, 6, 1, 2]
- Region y has bounding box [2, 8, 3, 4]
- Region z has bounding box [1, 10, 5, 6]

Checking the conditions:
- x S y:
  - x_max_y <= y_min_y => 2 <= 3 (valid)
  - y_min_x <= x_min_x => 2 <= 4 (valid)
  - x_max_x <= y_max_x => 6 <= 8 (valid)

- y S z:
  - y_max_y <= z_min_y => 4 <= 5 (valid)
  - z_min_x <= y_min_x => 1 <= 2 (valid)
  - y_max_x <= z_max_x => 8 <= 10 (valid)

Now, checking for x S z:
- x_max_y <= z_min_y => 2 <= 5 (valid)
- z_min_x <= x_min_x => 1 <= 4 (valid)
- x_max_x <= z_max_x => 6 <= 10 (valid)

So, x S z is satisfied.

Now, for x SW z:
- x_max_x <= z_min_x => 6 <= 1 (not valid)
- x_max_y <= z_min_y => 2 <= 5 (valid)

So, x can't be SW of z in this example.

For x SE z:
- z_max_x <= x_min_x => 10 <= 4 (not valid)
- x_max_y <= z_min_y => 2 <= 5 (valid)

So, x can't be SE of z in this example either.

Hmm, I'm not convinced that "x can be SW of z." Let's try to construct an example where x is SW of z, given that x S y and y S z.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's say:
- Region x has bounding box [1, 2, 1, 2]
- Region y has bounding box [3, 4, 3, 4]
- Region z has bounding box [5, 6, 5, 6]

Checking the conditions:
- x S y:
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) => 2 <= 3 (valid)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) => 3 <= 1 (not valid)
  - supx(x) <= supx(y) => 2 <= 4 (valid)

Wait, this doesn't satisfy x S y. Let me try another example:

- Region x has bounding box [3, 4, 1, 2]
- Region y has bounding box [2, 5, 3, 4]
- Region z has bounding box [6, 7, 5, 6]

Checking the conditions:
- x S y:
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) => 2 <= 3 (valid)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) => 2 <= 3 (valid)
  - supx(x) <= supx(y) => 4 <= 5 (valid)

- y S z:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z) => 4 <= 5 (valid)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y) => 6 <= 2 (not valid)
  - supx(y) <= supx(z) => 5 <= 7 (valid)

This doesn't satisfy y S z. Let me think further.

Let's try to understand the constraints better. If x S y, then infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). This means the x-projection of region x is contained within the x-projection of region y, but possibly shifted to the right.

Similarly, if y S z, then infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This means the x-projection of region y is contained within the x-projection of region z, but possibly shifted to the left.

Given these, can supx(x) <= infx(z) be satisfied? If infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), then infx(z) <= infx(x). Also, supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z).

But there's no direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z). It's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z) in some cases, especially if z is shifted far to the right.

Let's try one more example:

- Region x has bounding box [2, 3, 1, 2]
- Region y has bounding box [1, 4, 3, 4]
- Region z has bounding box [5, 6, 5, 6]

Checking the conditions:
- x S y:
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) => 2 <= 3 (valid)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= 2 (valid)
  - supx(x) <= supx(y) => 3 <= 4 (valid)

- y S z:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z) => 4 <= 5 (valid)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y) => 5 <= 1 (not valid)
  - supx(y) <= supx(z) => 4 <= 6 (valid)

Hmm, I'm having trouble constructing an example where x can be SW of z. Let's try a different approach.

Given the constraints:
- x S y => infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y S z => infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's derive the possible relations between x and z in the x-dimension:
- From infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we get infx(z) <= infx(x).
- From supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we get supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, in the x-dimension, the projection of region x is contained within the projection of region z, possibly shifted to the right.

For x SW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But from infx(z) <= infx(x), we know infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) (the last inequality holds for any region). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).

So, x can't be SW of z.

Similarly, for x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). But from supx(x) <= supx(z), we know infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (the first inequality holds for any region). This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).

So, x can't be SE of z.

Hmm, I think I got thrown off track. I realize that cardinal directions are more about the relative positions of the bounding boxes, not the regions themselves.

Let me clarify my understanding. If x is in the "South" relation to y:
- x is entirely below y (the highest point of x is below the lowest point of y)
- The x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y (possibly shifted to the right)

Similarly, if y is in the "South" relation to z, y is entirely below z, and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.

So, x is definitely below z. The relation between the x-projections of x and z depends on how they overlap.

From x S y and y S z, we derived that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z, possibly shifted to the right.

For x to be in the cardinal direction S relative to z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we know is satisfied)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've derived)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which we've derived)

All of these are satisfied. So, x is in the S relation to z.

For x to be in the cardinal direction SW relative to z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z), but can supx(x) <= infx(z) be satisfied given our constraints? From infx(z) <= infx(x), we know infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) (the last inequality holds for any region). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).

So, x can't be SW of z.

Similarly, for x to be in the cardinal direction SE relative to z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z), but can supx(z) <= infx(x) be satisfied given our constraints? From supx(x) <= supx(z), we know infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (the first inequality holds for any region). This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).

So, x can't be SE of z either.

Let me also check if x can be in any of the other cardinal directions relative to z:

- B (bounding box): For x B z, all of x should be within the bounding box of z. Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), x is entirely below z, so x can't be B of z.

- W (West): For x W z, x should be entirely to the left of z and vertically aligned with z. Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), x is entirely below z, so x can't be W of z.

- NW (North West): For x NW z, x should be entirely to the North-West of z. Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), x is entirely below z, so x can't be NW of z.

- N (North): For x N z, x should be entirely above z. Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), x is entirely below z, so x can't be N of z.

- NE (North East): For x NE z, x should be entirely to the North-East of z. Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), x is entirely below z, so x can't be NE of z.

- E (East): For x E z, x should be entirely to the right of z and vertically aligned with z. Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), x is entirely below z, so x can't be E of z.

In summary, given x S y and y S z, we've shown that the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is x S z. 

So, x S z.

Let me double-check: For x S z, we need these conditions to be satisfied:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (Derived and satisfied from x S y and y S z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (Derived and satisfied from x S y and y S z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (Derived and satisfied from x S y and y S z)

All three conditions are satisfied, confirming that x S z.

For the other cardinal directions, we've shown through logical deduction that they can't be satisfied, so x can't be in any cardinal direction relation to z other than S.

Actually, I'm going to try one last example for SW to make sure, because I'm still not 100% sure that SW is not a possible relation.

Let's define:
- Region x has bounding box [1, 2, 1, 2]
- Region y has bounding box [1, 4, 3, 4]
- Region z has bounding box [3, 6, 5, 6]

Checking the conditions:
- x S y:
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) => 2 <= 3 (valid)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= 1 (valid)
  - supx(x) <= supx(y) => 2 <= 4 (valid)

- y S z:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z) => 4 <= 5 (valid)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y) => 3 <= 1 (not valid)
  - supx(y) <= supx(z) => 4 <= 6 (valid)

so even this example doesn't work. given x S y and y S z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= infx(x). This is a constraint that doesn't allow infx(z) > supx(x), which would be needed for x to be in the SW relation to z.

Actually, I need to pay careful attention to these conditions:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y S z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x S y)

It does seem valid to say "infx(z) <= infx(x)" in this case. Let me try to work with more general coordinates to see if x SW z is genuinely possible:

- Region x has bounding box [x_min_x, x_max_x, x_min_y, x_max_y]
- Region y has bounding box [y_min_x, y_max_x, y_min_y, y_max_y]
- Region z has bounding box [z_min_x, z_max_x, z_min_y, z_max_y]

Given:
- x S y => x_max_y <= y_min_y, y_min_x <= x_min_x, x_max_x <= y_max_x
- y S z => y_max_y <= z_min_y, z_min_x <= y_min_x, y_max_x <= z_max_x

For x SW z, we need:
- x_max_x <= z_min_x
- x_max_y <= z_min_y

We know x_max_y <= y_min_y and y_max_y <= z_min_y. So, x_max_y <= z_min_y, satisfying the second condition for SW.

But for the first condition, we have:
- z_min_x <= y_min_x (y S z)
- y_min_x <= x_min_x (x S y)

So, z_min_x <= x_min_x. This means z_min_x <= x_min_x <= x_max_x. This contradicts the requirement x_max_x <= z_min_x for SW.

So, x can't be SW of z.

Let's verify the conditions for x S z:
- x_max_y <= z_min_y => Derived from x_max_y <= y_min_y and y_max_y <= z_min_y (valid)
- z_min_x <= x_min_x => Derived from z_min_x <= y_min_x and y_min_x <= x_min_x (valid)
- x_max_x <= z_max_x => Derived from x_max_x <= y_max_x and y_max_x <= z_max_x (valid)

All conditions for x S z are satisfied. So, x is in the S relation to z.

In conclusion, given x S y and y S z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is x S z.

Let me double-check: For x S z, we need these conditions to be satisfied:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (Derived and satisfied from x S y and y S z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (Derived and satisfied from x S y and y S z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (Derived and satisfied from x S y and y S z)

All three conditions are satisfied, confirming that x S z.

For the other cardinal directions, we've shown through logical deduction that they can't be satisfied, so x can't be in any cardinal direction relation to z other than S.

Actually, I think I'm being inconsistent. Let's check the exact definition x S y of as given in the problem:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

And y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

So, by transitivity, we get:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (from supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z))
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (from infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x))
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (from supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

These are exactly the conditions for x S z.

For x SW z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is satisfied)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

But from our derivation, we have infx(z) <= infx(x). Typically, for a region a, it's always the case that infx(a) <= supx(a). So, infx(x) <= supx(x). Combining, we get infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) for SW.

Similarly, for x SE z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is satisfied)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

But from our derivation, we have supx(x) <= supx(z). This contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for SE.

For the other directions, the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) is at odds with what would be needed.

So, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is x S z.

Actually, actually, let me do a sanity check to try to see if I can somehow construct a counterexample for SW (I have been flipping back and forth on this a few times).

Let's say:
- x is the box [(4, 6), (1, 2)]
- y is the box [(3, 7), (3, 4)]
- z is the box [(1, 2), (5, 6)]

Let's check:
- x S y:
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) => 2 <= 3 (valid)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) => 3 <= 4 (valid)
  - supx(x) <= supx(y) => 6 <= 7 (valid)

- y S z:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z) => 4 <= 5 (valid)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y) => 1 <= 3 (valid)
  - supx(y) <= supx(z) => 7 <= 2 (not valid)

Hmm, doesn't work. Let's try again:
- x is the box [(4, 6), (1, 2)]
- y is the box [(3, 7), (3, 4)]
- z is the box [(1, 8), (5, 6)]

Let's check:
- x S y:
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) => 2 <= 3 (valid)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) => 3 <= 4 (valid)
  - supx(x) <= supx(y) => 6 <= 7 (valid)

- y S z:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z) => 4 <= 5 (valid)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y) => 1 <= 3 (valid)
  - supx(y) <= supx(z) => 7 <= 8 (valid)

Now, for x SW z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) => 2 <= 5 (valid)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) => 6 <= 1 (not valid)

So, x is not SW of z.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) => 2 <= 5 (valid)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) => 1 <= 4 (valid)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) => 6 <= 8 (valid)

So, x is S of z.

I believe, given x S y and y S z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is x S z. This is both logically derived and confirmed through example testing.

Actually, wait, let me check if z S y and y S x would be valid, since we claimed earlier S is the only valid relation.

From the conditions:
- Region x has bounding box [4, 6, 1, 2]
- Region y has bounding box [3, 7, 3, 4]
- Region z has bounding box [1, 8, 5, 6]

Let's switch them around and see:
- x is the box [1, 8, 5, 6]
- y is the box [3, 7, 3, 4]
- z is the box [4, 6, 1, 2]

Now, let's check:
- x S y:
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) => 6 <= 3 (not valid)

Ah, this doesn't work because z is above y and y is above x, etc. So S is our answer.

Indeed, I've confirmed that given x S y and y S z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is x S z.

Wait, actually, let's be even more precise and see if there could be other directions. Let me list all the cardinal direction relations and rigorously check if any of them could be satisfied given x S y and y S z.

Given:
- x S y => supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y S z => supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's derive the relevant constraints on the relation between x and z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (from supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z))
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (from infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x))
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (from supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

Now, let's check all possible cardinal directions for x relative to z:

1. x B z (x is inside the bounding box of z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z) (both satisfied)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z) (not satisfied due to supy(x) <= infy(z))

2. x S z (x is to the South of z):
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z) (both satisfied)

3. x SW z (x is to the South-West of z):
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied)
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x))

4. x W z (x is to the West of z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x))
   - infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z) (not satisfied due to supy(x) <= infy(z))

5. x NW z (x is to the North-West of z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x))
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(x))

6. x N z (x is to the North of z):
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(x))
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z) (both satisfied)

7. x NE z (x is to the North-East of z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(x) <= supx(x))
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(x) >= infy(x))

8. x E z (x is to the East of z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(x) <= supx(x))
   - infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z) (not satisfied due to supy(x) <= infy(z))

9. x SE z (x is to the South-East of z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(x) <= supx(x))
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfied)

Upon rigorous checking, I've confirmed that given x S y and y S z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is x S z. All other cardinal directions can be logically ruled out based on the constraints derived.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is only S.

Actually, I feel like I might be making a mistake, so let's think carefully about these conditions:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

It concerns me that we're saying S is the only valid relation. So let me triple check by verifying that the conditions for SW are not possible.

Actually, from the definition of SW given in the problem:
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've established supy(x) <= infy(z), but we've also derived infx(z) <= infx(x). In general, for a region a, infx(a) <= supx(a). So, infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) for SW.

So, x can't be SW of z.

But wait, let's double check this reasoning by considering a particular case. suppose we have:
- x = [0, 3] x [0, 3]
- y = [-1, 4] x [4, 7]
- z = [-2, 5] x [8, 11]

Is x S y? let's check:
- supy(x) <= infy(y): 3 <= 4 (valid)
- infx(y) <= infx(x): -1 <= 0 (valid)
- supx(x) <= supx(y): 3 <= 4 (valid)

Yes, x S y. Is y S z? let's check:
- supy(y) <= infy(z): 7 <= 8 (valid)
- infx(z) <= infx(y): -2 <= -1 (valid)
- supx(y) <= supx(z): 4 <= 5 (valid)

Yes, y S z. Now, is x S z? let's check:
- supy(x) <= infy(z): 3 <= 8 (valid)
- infx(z) <= infx(x): -2 <= 0 (valid)
- supx(x) <= supx(z): 3 <= 5 (valid)

Yes, x S z.

For completeness, let's check if x could be SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): 3 <= -2 (not valid)

No, x is not SW of z, because supx(x) (3) is not less than or equal to infx(z) (-2).

This confirms my logical deduction: Given x S y and y S z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is x S z.

Let's do one more check, just to be 100% sure:

From the given conditions, x S y and y S z, we have:
- Relation between x and y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
- Relation between y and z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these, we derive:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

These exactly satisfy the conditions for x S z and no other cardinal direction can be simultaneously satisfied. For instance, x SW z would require supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x).

So, S is the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints x S y and y S z.

Actually, let me do one more check. There's a theorem in the problem statement: "There are regions a1, ..., ak in REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

In our context, if x S y and y S z, and the only possible cardinal direction relation for x relative to z is S, this means that given a region z as a reference, any region x that is S of z (and satisfies the additional constraints derived) would also be S of some intermediate region y, where y is S of z.

This is a transitivity property of the S relation, which aligns with our logical derivation.

After much analysis, this is what I've found: If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is that x is S of z. In cardinal direction nomenclature: x S z.

So, the only possible relation between region x and region z is S.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z given that x is S of y and y is S of z.

Given information:
- x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Analyzing what these imply for the relationship between x and z:

1. For the y-dimension:
   From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   From y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   Therefore: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

2. For the x-dimension:
   From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   From y S z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
   Therefore: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

These derived conditions (supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) precisely match the definition of the South relation.

For any other cardinal direction relation to hold between x and z, additional constraints would need to be satisfied, but these would contradict our derived conditions.

Therefore, S is the only possible relation between region x and region z.
