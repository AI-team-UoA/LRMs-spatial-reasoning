PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We are given that:
- x is N of y, which means supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is B of z, which means infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From x is N of y, we have:
1. supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y is B of z, we have:
4. infx(z) <= infx(y)
5. supx(y) <= supx(z)
6. infy(z) <= infy(y)
7. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, I'll try to deduce the possible relations between x and z. I'll check each relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) to see if it's compatible with the constraints above.

Let's start by looking at what we can infer from the constraints:

From (1) and (7), we get supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
From (2) and (4), we get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
From (3) and (5), we get supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).

Hmm, this doesn't immediately give us a clear constraint on the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z), or between infy(x) and infy(z). So, more than one relation might be possible.

Let's check each relation:

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our derived constraints, we know that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). However, we don't know if supy(z) <= infy(x) for sure. It's possible, but not guaranteed.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

We already know that supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless supx(z) = infx(x), which is a degenerate case). So, x cannot be NE of z.

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Again, we have a contradiction with supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be E of z.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Contradiction with supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be SE of z.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our derived constraints, we know that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But for supy(x) <= infy(z), we know from (1) that supy(y) <= infy(x), and from (6) that infy(z) <= infy(y). This implies that infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) < infy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be S of z, unless infy(x) = supy(x) and infy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y). But this would mean that x and y are degenerate regions along the y-axis. Given that we're working with regions in REG (which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk), this is not a typical scenario.

Actually, I made a mistake. Let's re-analyze the S relation:

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From (1), we have supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies supy(y) < supy(x) (since regions in REG have non-zero area).
From (6), we have infy(z) <= infy(y).

We can't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z) based on these. It's still possible for x to be S of z, but it's not guaranteed.

I think I'm getting confused. Let me restart with a clearer analysis.

We know:
- x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is B of z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (from (2) and (4))
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (from (3) and (5))
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from (6))
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from (7))
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from (1))

Now, let's check each possible relation between x and z:

1. x N z: We need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   From the derived constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), but we can't be sure about supy(z) <= infy(x).
   From (1) and (7), we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't definitively tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).
   So, x could be N of z, but it's not guaranteed.

Hmm, let me try a different approach. I'll think about the possible positions of x and z relative to y, and then determine their possible relations.

Given the constraints:
- x is N of y: Region x is completely above region y, with possible horizontal overlap.
- y is B of z: Region y is completely inside the minimum bounding box of region z, but we don't know the exact shape of z within its bounding box.

Let's think about the possible positions of x relative to z. 

The horizontal span of z (from infx(z) to supx(z)) contains the horizontal span of y (from infx(y) to supx(y)), and the horizontal span of x (from infx(x) to supx(x)) is contained within the horizontal span of y.

So, the horizontal span of x (from infx(x) to supx(x)) is contained within the horizontal span of z (from infx(z) to supx(z)). In other words, x is horizontally bounded by z.

Now, let's consider the vertical position. We know that x is completely above y, and y is bounded below by infy(z) and above by supy(z). 

For the relationship between x and y on the vertical axis, we have supy(y) <= infy(x). And for the relationship between y and z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From these, we can deduce:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) < infy(x).
- supy(y) <= supy(z), but we don't know the exact relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) or supy(x).

To sum up, the horizontal span of x is contained within the horizontal span of z, and x is vertically positioned such that its bottom is above the bottom of z. But depending on how high z extends, a few relations between x and z are possible:

1. N: If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is N of z.
2. NW: If supx(x) < infx(z) and supy(z) < infy(x), but this contradicts the fact that the horizontal span of x is contained within the horizontal span of z.
3. NE: If supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(z) < infy(x), but this also contradicts the horizontal span containment.
4. B: If infy(x) < supy(z) and the horizontal span of x is within the horizontal span of z, then x could be B of z.
5. W: If supx(x) < infx(z) and infy(z) < infy(x) and supy(x) < supy(z), but this contradicts the horizontal span containment.
6. E: If supx(z) < infx(x) and infy(z) < infy(x) and supy(x) < supy(z), but this also contradicts the horizontal span containment.
7. S: If supy(x) <= infy(z), but this contradicts the fact that infy(z) < infy(x).
8. SW: If supx(x) < infx(z) and supy(x) < infy(z), but this contradicts both the horizontal span containment and the vertical positioning.
9. SE: If supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) < infy(z), but this contradicts both the horizontal span containment and the vertical positioning.

Wait, I made some mistakes in the above analysis for NW, W, SW relations. I was assuming that supx(x) < infx(z) means that x is to the left of z, but that's not right. For x to be to the left of z, we need supx(x) < infx(z).

Similarly for NE, E, SE relations, I was assuming that supx(z) < infx(x) means that x is to the right of z, but that's not right. For x to be to the right of z, we need supx(z) < infx(x).

Let me correct my analysis and be more careful about the constraints:

We have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (from constraints)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (from constraints)

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But from the constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) < supx(x) (since x has non-zero area). This contradicts the condition for NW. So, x cannot be NW of z.

For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Again, the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). Also, from infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), we get infy(z) < infy(x), which implies infy(z) < supy(x) (since x has non-zero area). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). From the constraints, we have supx(x) <= supx(z), which implies infx(x) < supx(z) (since x has non-zero area). This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be E of z.

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Again, the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). Also, from infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), we get infy(z) < infy(x), which implies infy(z) < supy(x) (since x has non-zero area). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SE of z.

For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). From the constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which aligns with the first two conditions for S. However, we've also established that infy(z) < infy(x), which implies infy(z) < supy(x) (since x has non-zero area). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). From the constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which aligns with the last two conditions for N. However, we can't definitively determine the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) from the given constraints. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is N of z; otherwise, it isn't.

For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). From the constraints, we know that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've also established that infy(z) < infy(x), which aligns with the third condition. However, we can't definitively determine the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) from the given constraints. If supy(x) <= supy(z), then x could be B of z; otherwise, it isn't.

So, based on the analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N: If supy(z) <= infy(x)
- B: If supy(x) <= supy(z)

Actually, there's a third possibility that I overlooked. It's possible for x to not have any of the defined basic relations with z.

OK let me rethink this a bit to make sure. 

Hmm at this point I think I should restart and use drawing to make sure I get this right.

Let's draw this out:

We have three regions: x, y, z. And we know the following relations:
- x is N of y
- y is B of z

Let's start by visualizing y being B of z. This means y is contained within the minimum bounding box of z. However, z can extend beyond y in various ways.

Now, with x being N of y, x is completely above y.

Given these positions, the possible relationships between x and z are constrained by the extents of z. I'll try to understand all possible positions of z:

- Given y is B of z, the perimeter of y may touch the perimeter of z.
- z may extend beyond the bounding box of y in any direction.
- x is above y, and the horizontal span of x is within the horizontal span of y.

I need to consider how far z extends:

1. If z doesn't extend above y, specifically if supy(z) = supy(y), then we know supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies supy(z) <= infy(x), making x N of z.

2. If z extends above y but doesn't cover the entire vertical span of x, meaning supy(y) < supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is still N of z.

3. If z extends above y and covers part of x, but not all of it, meaning infy(x) < supy(z) < supy(x), then x is neither completely inside nor completely outside z. In this case, none of the basic cardinal direction relations hold.

4. If z extends above y and covers the entire vertical span of x, meaning supy(x) <= supy(z), and since we know from the constraints that the horizontal span of x is within the horizontal span of z, then x is B of z.

To sum up, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N: if supy(z) <= infy(x)
- B: if infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z)

Wait, for B, do we know infy(z) <= infy(x)? Let's check:
From y is B of z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
From x is N of y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).

So, infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), which confirms infy(z) < infy(x). The "less than" is because the regions are supposed to have non-zero areas.

OK actually I need to be more careful. It's possible that z doesn't fully extend laterally to cover the horizontal span of y. If z doesn't extend to the left or right boundary of y, then x might not have a clear cardinal direction relation with z. And actually according to the definition of B given in the intro, it is possible that z is a donut and y is in the hole.

Let's be careful with the constraints. We know:
- x is N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).
- y is B of z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let's combine these to derive constraints between x and z:

From x is N of y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y is B of z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z).

So, we're not sure about the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). It could be supy(z) <= infy(x) or supy(z) > infy(x).

From x is N of y, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
From y is B of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Combining these: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
So, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From y is B of z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y).

Using the derived constraints, let's assess each possible relation:

- N: We need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The last two conditions are met. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is N of z.

- NE: We need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x). We know supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

Actually, let me quickly try to convince myself of this. From x is N of y and y is B of z, we derive infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The latter condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), would contradict the condition for NE, which requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Thus, x cannot be NE of z.

- E: We need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The first two conditions, supx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x), cannot be simultaneously true unless supx(z) = infx(x) (and hence supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(x)), which would mean x is a degenerate region, contradicting the assumption that regions in REG have non-zero area. So, x cannot be E of z.

Actually, it's not that supx(z) = infx(x) implies both regions are degenerate, it's just that for regions in REG, infx(x) < supx(x) and infx(z) < supx(z). Thus, if supx(z) = infx(x) (which would be the only possibility to have both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x) true), then infx(z) < supx(z) = infx(x) < supx(x). But this contradicts the second condition for E, which is supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be E of z.

- SE: We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). As shown above, supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be SE of z.

- S: We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The last two conditions are met. However, from the given constraints, we know that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). So, infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x), which implies infy(z) < supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

- SW: We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We know infx(z) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) < supx(x) (since x has non-zero area). This contradicts the condition for SW. Also, as shown for S, infy(z) < supy(x) contradicts the second condition. So, x cannot be SW of z.

- W: We need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). As shown for SW, supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be W of z.

- NW: We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). As shown for W, supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be NW of z.

- B: We need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two conditions are met. We've also shown that infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) < infy(x), which means the third condition is also met. If supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is B of z; otherwise, it isn't.

So after a careful analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. N: If supy(z) <= infy(x)
2. B: If supy(x) <= supy(z)

And if neither of the above conditions is met (i.e., infy(x) < supy(z) < supy(x)), then x overlaps with z in a way that doesn't fit any of the basic cardinal direction relations.

But the problem definition states that the cardinal direction relations are the only 9 relations, and based on the given constraints, x and z must relate somehow.

Actually, I'm kind of confused because the conditions for N and B are not necessarily mutually exclusive. If supy(z) = infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is both N and B of z?

Oh wait, I think I'm misunderstanding something. A cardinal direction relation is a relation between two regions. The relation specifies which tiles of the 9-tile grid the primary region occupies w.r.t the reference region. So, if the relation has multiple tiles, the primary region spans those tiles.

In the given question, the relation between x and z could be a multi-tile relation. Let me re-analyze:

1. From the derived constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), we know that x is horizontally contained within z.

2. We know infy(z) < infy(x), which means x is either in the N, NE, or NW tiles, or a combination of them, or in the B tile.

3. From (1), x cannot be exclusively in the NE or NW tiles. It's either in the N tile or spans between the N and B tiles.

Let me try to reason again:

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is in the N tile.
If supy(z) > infy(x), there are two subcases:
2.1 If supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is in the B tile.
2.2 If supy(x) > supy(z), then x spans the N and B tiles, which results in the multi-tile relation N : B.

Wait, I'm still confusing myself. Let me go back to basics.

A cardinal direction relation denotes the tile(s) that a primary region occupies with respect to a reference region. The relation can be a single tile (e.g., N, S, E, W, etc.) or a combination of tiles (e.g., N : NE).

In the given question, we want to determine the possible relations between x and z, where z is the reference region. We've derived that:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) < infy(x)

The first constraint means that horizontally, x is contained within z. The second constraint means that vertically, the bottom of x is above the bottom of z.

Now, I need to determine which tile(s) of z's grid x is in. Given the horizontal containment, x can't be exclusively in the E, W, NE, NW, SE, or SW tiles.

Since infy(z) < infy(x), x can't be exclusively in the S, SE, or SW tiles. It could be in the N, B, or a combination of these.

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is in the N tile, making the relation N.
If infy(x) < supy(z), then there are two subcases:
- If supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is in the B tile, making the relation B. Actually, this technically violates the definition of 'B' slightly in the original definition: "a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)". For strict 'B', we need to B tile.
- If supy(x) > supy(z), then x spans the B and N tiles, making the relation B : N.

Actually, let's be most precise and directly check if x hits one, some, or any of the 9 tile regions:

1. B tile: This is the interior of the reference region. For x to hit the B tile, we need to check if x and z have a non-empty interior-interior intersection. Given the constraints, it's possible for x to have a portion inside the B tile, especially if supy(z) > infy(x).

2. N tile: This is the region directly above the reference region. For x to hit the N tile, we need to check if x extends above z. If supy(z) < supy(x), then x has a portion in the N tile.

3. S tile: This is the region directly below the reference region. For x to hit the S tile, we need to check if x extends below z. Given infy(z) < infy(x), x cannot be below z. So, x doesn't hit the S tile.

4. E tile: This is the region directly to the right of the reference region. For x to hit the E tile, we need to check if x extends to the right of z. Given supx(x) <= supx(z), x cannot be to the right of z. So, x doesn't hit the E tile.

5. W tile: This is the region directly to the left of the reference region. For x to hit the W tile, we need to check if x extends to the left of z. Given infx(z) <= infx(x), x cannot be to the left of z. So, x doesn't hit the W tile.

6. NE tile: This is the region to the top-right of the reference region. For x to hit the NE tile, we need to check if x extends above and to the right of z. Given supx(x) <= supx(z), x cannot be to the right of z. So, x doesn't hit the NE tile.

7. NW tile: This is the region to the top-left of the reference region. For x to hit the NW tile, we need to check if x extends above and to the left of z. Given infx(z) <= infx(x), x cannot be to the left of z. So, x doesn't hit the NW tile.

8. SE tile: This is the region to the bottom-right of the reference region. For x to hit the SE tile, we need to check if x extends below and to the right of z. Given infy(z) < infy(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), x cannot be below and to the right of z. So, x doesn't hit the SE tile.

9. SW tile: This is the region to the bottom-left of the reference region. For x to hit the SW tile, we need to check if x extends below and to the left of z. Given infy(z) < infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x), x cannot be below and to the left of z. So, x doesn't hit the SW tile.

From the analysis, x can hit the B and/or N tiles. 

1. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is exclusively in the N tile, making the relation N.
2. If infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is exclusively in the B tile, making the relation B. Actually, that last and is wrong, if x were in the B tile then infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) wouldn't be strict, they be full on equalities, which we don't necessarily know from the constraints!
3. If infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z), then x spans the B and N tiles, making the relation B : N.

No wait, I'm confusing myself. For x to be in the B tile of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But these are just the conditions for the region x to be completely inside the bounding box of the region z. If x is exclusively in the B tile, it doesn't mean x and z have a non-empty interior-interior intersection.

I apologize for my confusion. Let's think of the cardinal directions more broadly:

The definition from section says:
"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

So a cardinal direction relation expresses the location of one (primary) region w.r.t. another (reference) region. The relation tells us which of the 9 tiles the primary region covers w.r.t. the reference region.

OK let's try one more time, I think I'm overcomplicating.

We have:
- x is N of y
- y is B of z

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

From the definition of B, y is contained within the minimum bounding box of z, but y and z don't necessarily have the same bounding box.

From the definition of N, x is above y, with some horizontal overlap.

Given these relations and the derived constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of y's left boundary, which is to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of y's right boundary, which is to the left of z's right boundary)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom boundary is above z's bottom boundary)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top boundary is below z's top boundary)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom boundary is above y's top boundary)

From these, I need to determine which of the 9 tiles (or a combination thereof) x occupies w.r.t. z.

Given the horizontal constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) 

This means x's horizontal span is contained within z's horizontal span. This tells me x can only be in the middle column of the 9-tile grid (which includes B, N, S).

And the vertical constraint:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) (ensuring infy(x) > infy(z), where ">" is because regions have non-zero area)

This means x's bottom boundary is above z's bottom boundary. This tells me x can only be in the middle or top row of the 9-tile grid (which includes W, B, E, NW, N, NE).

Combining the horizontal and vertical constraints, x can only be in the B or N tiles. If the whole of region x is above region z, then the relation is N. If part of x is inside the bounding box of z, then the relation could be B or a combination of B and N.

Based on the relation definitions and derived constraints:

1. For x to be N of z: supy(z) <= infy(x)
2. For x to be B of z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the derived constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and infy(z) < infy(x). So, for x to be exclusively B, we also need supy(x) <= supy(z).

Based on the above:
- If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is N of z.
- If supy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) > infy(x), then x is B of z.
- If supy(x) > supy(z) and supy(z) > infy(x), then x spans the B and N tiles, making the relation B : N.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N
- B
- B : N

My apologies, there's a formal definition of the cardinal relation for this scenario, which I should use. A cardinal direction relation describes which tiles the primary region (x) occupies w.r.t. the reference region (z). 

Let's restate the constraints more clearly:
- x is N of y, which means supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).
- y is B of z, which means infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From these, we derive horizontal and vertical constraints for x and z:
- Horizontally: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means x's horizontal span is contained within z's horizontal span, so x can only be in the middle column of z's 9-tile grid.
- Vertically: infy(z) < infy(x). This means x's bottom boundary is above z's bottom boundary, so x can't be in the bottom row of z's 9-tile grid.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z depend on the relative positions of the top boundaries:

1. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is entirely above z. According to the definition, this means x is N of z.
2. If infy(x) < supy(z) < supy(x), then x partially overlaps with z's bounding box. The portion within the bounding box is in the B tile, and the portion above is in the N tile. So, the relation is B : N.
3. If supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is entirely within z's bounding box. According to the definition, this means x is B of z.

OK let's double check for B and for N by using the definitions we were given:

N: We need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). From the derived constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), so the horizontal conditions are met. If supy(z) <= infy(x) (condition to check), then x is N of z.

B: We need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). From the derived constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and infy(z) < infy(x). If supy(x) <= supy(z) (condition to check), then x is B of z.

These are not mutually exclusive, and are condition on supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), respectively.

Actually, these are mutually exclusive. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(z) < supy(x) (since regions have non-zero area), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) for B. So, a region cannot simultaneously be N and B of another region.

To summarize, there are three possibilities:
1. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then the relation is N.
2. If supy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) > infy(x), then the relation is B.
3. If supy(x) > supy(z) and supy(z) > infy(x), then the relation is B : N.

OK according to the problem definition, a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1 : … : Rk.

From a pure mathematical perspective, the conditions I've given define the following regions as the possible related directly between region x and region z:
1. N
2. B
3. B : N

Actually, in case #3, regions x and z would form the composite relation: B : N. And that's a problem because according to the exact problem definition, a cardinal direction relation can be a single tile (e.g., N, S, E), or a combination of tiles (e.g., N : NE), and the relation is the set of tiles that the primary region (in this case, x) occupies. But the problem definition says the possible answers to the question can be one or many of these specific relations:

N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.

It doesn't seem to list combinations like B : N. So I believe I should be restrictive with the definition, and "B : N" is not a valid answer. So the possible relations are only:
1. N
2. B

Here's how I interpret the problem: If there's a region x that's N of region y, and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible basic cardinal direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) between region x and region z?

Given the derived constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's horizontal span is contained within z's horizontal span)
- infy(z) < infy(x) (x's bottom boundary is above z's bottom boundary)

And adding the constraint from the problem definition that the relation must be a basic cardinal direction, we need to check which of the 9 basic relations can hold:

- N: If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is entirely above z. This relation is possible.
- B: If infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is entirely within z's bounding box. This relation is possible.
- All other basic relations (NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) can be ruled out as shown in the previous analyses.

However, someone might interpret the problem differently: If there's a region x that's N of region y, and region y is B of region z, then what are all the possible cardinal direction relations (including multi-tile relations) between region x and region z?

In that interpretation, the answer would be:
- N
- B
- B : N

I'm a bit stuck here, but I think the problem wants the answer to be one or many of the 9 choices given. From my analysis, I've concluded that the possible relations are:
- N
- B

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are N and B.

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations (x is N of y and y is B of z), I'll determine the possible relations between regions x and z by analyzing the constraints.

When x is N of y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (horizontal constraint)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (horizontal constraint)

When y is B of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (horizontal constraint)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (horizontal constraint)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (vertical constraint)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (vertical constraint)

Combining these constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom is above z's bottom)

For a region x to be N of z:
- We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- The horizontal conditions are satisfied, but supy(z) ≤ infy(x) depends on how high z extends

For x to be B of z:
- We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- The first three conditions are satisfied, but supy(x) ≤ supy(z) depends on how high x and z extend

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
N, B
