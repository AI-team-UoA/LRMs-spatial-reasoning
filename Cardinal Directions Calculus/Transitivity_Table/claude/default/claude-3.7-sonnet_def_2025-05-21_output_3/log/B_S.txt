PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

We need to figure out the possible cardinal directions that region x could have with respect to region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y: This means x is in the bounding box of y. So x is contained within y.
- Region y is S of region z: This means y is to the south of z.

Let's analyze what this means for the relative positions:

If x is in the bounding box of y, then:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

If y is south of z, then:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, let's find out what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [from x B y]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) [from y S z]
- Therefore, infx(z) ≤ infx(x)

- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) [from x B y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [from y S z]
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) [from x B y]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) [from y S z]
- Therefore, supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- This implies supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and we can't directly relate infy(x) to infy(z)

- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) [from x B y]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) [from y S z]
- Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

So, the constraints we have for x relative to z are:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This means that x could be:
- South of z (S): if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- Southwest of z (SW): if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- Southeast of z (SE): if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Actually, let me re-examine this analysis, as there seems to be an issue with the SE case.

For the x-coordinates:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [from x B y]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) [from y S z]
- Therefore, infx(z) ≤ infx(x)

- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) [from x B y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [from y S z]
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

So the x-coordinate constraints for x relative to z are:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) [from x B y]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) [from y S z]
- Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

So the y-coordinate constraint for x relative to z is:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Based on these constraints, x could be:
- S of z: if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- SW of z: if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- SE of z: if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

But there's still an issue with the SW and SE cases. Let me recheck the definitions of these relations:

- a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

So for x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

And for x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

But from our derived constraints, we found that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not possible (since that would imply supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z), a degenerate case where the x-coordinate is fixed). Similarly, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is also not generally possible.

So, it seems like the only consistent relation is x S z (x is south of z).

Actually, I think I need to re-examine this. Let's step back and visualize this scenario more clearly:

- Region x is inside the bounding box of region y.
- Region y is south of region z.

This means that y doesn't overlap with z in the y-coordinate, and y is strictly below z. Also, the x-coordinate projection of y falls within the x-coordinate projection of z.

Given that x is inside the bounding box of y, x's projection on both axes falls within y's projection. So, x is below y and x's x-coordinate projection falls within y's.

Given these conditions, x must be south of z as well, but not necessarily SE or SW. This is because the x-coordinate projection of x falls within that of y, which in turn falls within that of z. But the y-coordinate of x ensures that it's below z, making it S of z.

Let me double check if there are other possibilities:

For x to be B of z (inside z's bounding box), we'd need infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts our finding that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (since regions have positive height, supy(x) > infy(x)).

For x to be W, NW, N, NE, or E of z, we'd need conditions on the y-coordinate that are incompatible with supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

So, the only plausible relation is x S z.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. Given that y is S of z, and x is B of y, x is contained within y, and y doesn't overlap with z in terms of the y-coordinate. But, I need to be careful about the x-coordinate.

From the constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [combining x B y and y S z]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [combining x B y and y S z]

This indicates that the x-coordinate of x falls within the x-coordinate of z. So, x can be:

- S of z if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z): This means the x-coordinate projection of x falls entirely within that of z.
- SW of z if supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This means x is to the left of z.
- SE of z if supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This means x is to the right of z.

Wait, the constraints I mentioned above (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)) would mean that x's x-coordinate projection falls within that of z, so SW and SE are not possible.

But I think I need to recheck whether my combination of constraints is correct.

From "x B y", we get:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From "y S z", we get:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

But, the constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) is not correct. From "x B y", we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x), but from "y S z", we just get a constraint about the y-coordinate, not infx(z) ≤ infx(y).

Let me revisit the definition of S: a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

So, if y S z, then:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y's maximum y-coordinate is at most z's minimum y-coordinate)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's minimum x-coordinate is at least z's minimum x-coordinate)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's maximum x-coordinate is at most z's maximum x-coordinate)

Combining this with x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [from x B y]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) [from y S z]
- This implies infx(z) ≤ infx(x)

- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) [from x B y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [from y S z]
- This implies supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) [from x B y]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) [from y S z]

- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) [from x B y]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) [from y S z]
- This implies supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

With these, let's check the possible relations between x and z:

For the cardinal direction "S":
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✓

So, x S z is a possible relation.

For the cardinal direction "SW":
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): Not guaranteed. In fact, from the constraints infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), it's contradictory unless infx(z) = infx(x) and supx(x) = supx(z), which is a degenerate case.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓

So, x SW z is generally not possible except perhaps in degenerate cases.

For the cardinal direction "SE":
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x): Contradictory with infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (unless they are equal).
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓

So, x SE z is generally not possible either, except perhaps in degenerate cases.

For the cardinal direction "B":
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✓
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x): Contradictory with supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (unless they are equal).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ✓ (given that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infy(z) ≤ supy(z))

So, x B z is generally not possible.

Similarly, we can check for W, NW, N, NE, and E, but they won't be consistent with the constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which indicates that x is below z.

OK let's be more careful here, and work through each of the 9 possible relations between x and z.

1. x S z:
   - Requirements: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - From our constraints, we have: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - All requirements are satisfied. So, x S z is possible.

2. x SW z:
   - Requirements: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - From our constraints, we have: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (because regions have positive width, supx(x) > infx(x)). So, x SW z is not possible.

3. x SE z:
   - Requirements: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - From our constraints, we have: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x) contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (because regions have positive width, supx(z) > infx(z) ≤ infx(x) < supx(x)). So, x SE z is not possible.

4. x W z:
   - Requirements: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From our constraints, we have: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - Given that regions have positive height, infy(z) < supy(z), so we have supy(x) ≤ infy(z) < supy(z), which means supy(x) < supy(z). That part is consistent.
   - But another requirement for W is infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts the constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (because regions have positive height, infy(x) < supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies infy(x) < infy(z)). So, x W z is not possible.

5. x E z:
   - Requirements: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - Similar to the reasoning for W, this is also not possible due to the contradiction between infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

6. x NW z:
   - Requirements: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From our constraints, we have: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (because infy(x) < supy(x) ≤ infy(z) < supy(z), so infy(x) < supy(z)). So, x NW z is not possible.

7. x N z:
   - Requirements: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - Similarly, the constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x N z is not possible.

8. x NE z:
   - Requirements: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - This also contradicts the constraints. So, x NE z is not possible.

9. x B z:
   - Requirements: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From our constraints, we have: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The requirement infy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts the constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (because regions have positive height, infy(x) < supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies infy(x) < infy(z)). So, x B z is not possible.

So out of the 9 cardinal directions, only "S" seems consistent for the relation between x and z.

Actually, I'm going to re-examine this more carefully. In the interpretation of "x is B of y", it's saying that x is contained within the bounding box of y. This doesn't mean that x is the full bounding box of y; it could be a smaller region within that bounding box.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y: This means x is in the bounding box of y.
- Region y is S of region z: This means y is to the south of z.

Let's think of the possible positions of x within y's bounding box:

1. x could be fully contained within y, with no part of x touching the boundary of y.
2. x could touch one or more edges of y's bounding box.

Now, given that y is south of z, the bounding box of y has certain constraints relative to z:

- y's bounding box's top edge is below z's bottom edge: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- y's bounding box's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge: infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- y's bounding box's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge: supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these constraints with the fact that x is within y's bounding box:

- x's left edge isn't to the left of y's left edge: infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- x's right edge isn't to the right of y's right edge: supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- x's bottom edge isn't below y's bottom edge: infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- x's top edge isn't above y's top edge: supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Combining all these, x might be:

1. South of z: If x is positioned such that its x-projection falls within z's x-projection and it's entirely below z.
2. Southwest of z: If x is positioned in the southwest corner of y such that it's to the left of z's left edge.
3. Southeast of z: If x is positioned in the southeast corner of y such that it's to the right of z's right edge.

Actually, I don't think SW or SE are possible. According to the constraints, y's x-projection falls within z's x-projection, because:
- y's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge: infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- y's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge: supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

And x's x-projection falls within y's x-projection, because:
- x's left edge isn't to the left of y's left edge: infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- x's right edge isn't to the right of y's right edge: supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

Transitively, x's x-projection falls within z's x-projection:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

This means that x can't be to the left of z's left edge or to the right of z's right edge, eliminating the possibility of SW and SE.

So, with the given constraints, the only possible cardinal direction of x with respect to z is "S".

Actually, I think I need to re-review the definition of South (S).

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

So, for a to be S of b:
- a's top edge is at or below b's bottom edge: supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
- a's left edge isn't to the left of b's left edge: infx(b) ≤ infx(a)
- a's right edge isn't to the right of b's right edge: supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

I think the issue with my previous analysis was in interpreting the constraints. Let's go back to the given constraints and properly derive the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- x is B of y: This means infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y is S of z: This means supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Let's determine the constraints between x and z:

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) [from x B y]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) [from y S z]
- So, supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

For the x-coordinates:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [from x B y]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) [from y S z]
- This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z)

- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) [from x B y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [from y S z]
- So, supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Now, from the constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is clearly below z. This means x could be S, SW, or SE of z.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) [unclear from constraints]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✓

For x to be SW of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) [unclear from constraints]

For x to be SE of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) [unclear from constraints]

Given that we've only established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but not the relation between infx(x) and infx(z) or other necessary constraints for SW or SE, we can't definitively say if x is S, SW, or SE of z.

Let's reconsider. The regions in the problem are within REG, so they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. These regions are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries.

If x is B of y, it doesn't necessarily mean x's x-projection falls within y's x-projection. It just means x is contained within the rectangular bounding box of y. Similarly for the y-projection.

Let me reexamine the constraints:

Given:
- x is B of y: This means infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y is S of z: This means supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, let's determine the constraints between x and z:

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) [from x B y]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) [from y S z]
- So, supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Wait, I don't think I'm getting this right. Let me go back to the definitions.

a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b). This means a is contained within the bounding box of b.

So, x B y means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge isn't to the left of y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge isn't to the right of y's right edge)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom edge isn't below y's bottom edge)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top edge isn't above y's top edge)

Now, y S z means:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y's top edge is at or below z's bottom edge)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge)

Combining these, we can say:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x's top edge is at or below z's bottom edge)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (We can't directly infer anything about the relation between infx(x) and infx(z))
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (x's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge)

So, the definite constraints we have for x relative to z are:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x's top edge is at or below z's bottom edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge)

Wait, actually infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) does give us a direct relationship: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge).

So the definite constraints we have for x relative to z are:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x's top edge is at or below z's bottom edge)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge)

These are exactly the constraints for x to be S of z. So, x is South of z.

Actually, I think I've been confusing myself. Let me approach this more systematically.

Given:
- x is B of y, meaning x is contained within the bounding box of y.
- y is S of z, meaning y is to the south of z.

The bounding box of a region is the rectangular region formed by the straight lines x=infx(a), x=supx(a), y=infy(a) and y=supy(a).

So, x B y means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

And y S z means:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, from these, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

But wait, there's an issue in the chaining in the second bullet point. From x B y, we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x), not the other way around. Let me reapproach this.

x B y means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge isn't to the left of y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge isn't to the right of y's right edge)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom edge isn't below y's bottom edge)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top edge isn't above y's top edge)

Pictorially, x is confined to be within the bounding box of y. It could be any shape or position within that box.

y S z means:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y's top edge is at or below z's bottom edge)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge)

Pictorially, y is below z, but the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z.

Now, let's think about the possible positions of x relative to z. Since x is within the bounding box of y, and y is below z, x is also below z. But for the x-coordinates, there's more flexibility.

The x-projection of y is bounded by the x-projection of z, because infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z). But x can be positioned anywhere within the bounding box of y, meaning its x-projection can extend beyond the x-projection of z.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) [Guaranteed by the constraints: supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) [Unclear from constraints]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) [Unclear from constraints]

For x to be SW of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) [Guaranteed]
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) [Unclear from constraints]

For x to be SE of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) [Guaranteed]
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) [Unclear from constraints]

From the constraints, we can infer that x is below z. But the x-coordinate relationship can vary depending on the specific position of x within y's bounding box.

Since infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), it follows that infx(z) ≤ infx(x). And since supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), it follows that supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

So, from the constraints, x is south of z. But let me check if any other cardinal directions are possible based on the specific positioning of x within y.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's go back to the definitions and reason step by step.

Given:
- x is B of y: This means x is contained within the bounding box of y.
- y is S of z: This means y is to the south of z.

What can we infer about the position of x relative to z?

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these constraints:
From x B y and y S z, we get:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This tells us that x is below z.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ... wait, is this correct?

From x B y, we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x). This means that x's left edge is not to the left of y's left edge.
From y S z, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means that y's left edge is not to the left of z's left edge.

Combining these, we can't directly infer a relationship between infx(z) and infx(x).

Let me draw out a diagram to understand this better:

z's bounding box:    |   z  |
y's bounding box:     | y |
x's bounding box:      |x|

In this scenario, infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x's left edge is to the right of y's left edge, which is to the right of z's left edge. But this doesn't necessarily mean infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Actually, let's think about this more intuitively:
- The region x is somewhere inside the bounding box of y.
- The region y is south of z.

So, x is somewhere within the bounding box of y, which is south of z. Given this, x could be:
- South of z: If x's x-projection falls within z's x-projection.
- Southwest of z: If x is to the left of z's left edge.
- Southeast of z: If x is to the right of z's right edge.

Wait, given that y is south of z, y's x-projection falls within z's x-projection (because infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)). 

Now, x can be anywhere within the bounding box of y, but the bounding box of y has constraints on its x-coordinates due to its relationship with z. So, the potential positions of x in terms of its x-coordinates are restricted.

The bounding box of y has x-coordinates bounded by infx(y) and supx(y).
Now, we have:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

This means the bounding box of y, in terms of its x-coordinates, is bounded by the bounding box of z. Since x is within the bounding box of y, it too is bounded, in terms of its x-coordinates, by the bounding box of z.

So, infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Actually, let me refactor my thought process here. infx(y) ≤ infx(x) means x's left edge is further to the right than y's left edge, with infx(y) and infx(x) being the x-coordinate bounds of y and x respectively.

So, from the constraints:
- x is within the bounding box of y, which means its coordinates are bounded by the coordinates of y's bounding box.
- y is south of z, which means y's x-coordinate bounds are bounded by the x-coordinate bounds of z.

Given these two, x's x-coordinate bounds are transitively bounded by the x-coordinate bounds of z. But this doesn't directly mean x is south of z; it could still be southeast or southwest.

Let's reason this through differently, without reusing formulas.

Given that x is B of y: Region x is inside the bounding box of region y.
Given that y is S of z: Region y is south of (below) region z.

What can we infer about the relationship between x and z?

Since x is inside the bounding box of y, and the entire bounding box of y is south of z, it follows that x is also south of z.

But the term "south" in the cardinal directions can be specific. Let's look at the definitions:

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

So, for a to be strictly south of b, a must be below b, and a's x-projection must be within b's x-projection.

From the given constraints, we can infer that x is definitely below z. But the exact nature of their x-projections is not immediately clear from the constraints.

For example, if y is at the extreme southwest of z's bounding box, and x is at the extreme west of y's bounding box, then x would be southwest of z, not directly south.

Hmm, wait, I think I'm not thinking about the constraints properly. You know what, let's stick to the formulas.

x B y means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge isn't to the left of y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge isn't to the right of y's right edge)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom edge isn't below y's bottom edge)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top edge isn't above y's top edge)

y S z means:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y's top edge is at or below z's bottom edge)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge)

OK, let's combine these to see what the constraints between x and z are.

Constraint 1: y S z --> infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
Constraint 2: x B y --> infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
From 1 and 2: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)

Constraint 3: x B y --> supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
Constraint 4: y S z --> supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
From 3 and 4: supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Constraint 5: x B y --> supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
Constraint 6: y S z --> supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
From 5 and 6: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These three derived constraints: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) collectively dictate that x is S of z.

Wait, let me verify again that my chaining of constraints is logically correct:

From x B y, we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x).
From y S z, we get infx(z) ≤ infx(y).

By transitivity, if infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), then infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Hold up, I think I've been confusing myself with the ≤ signs. Let's think of these as:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) means "the left edge of x is to the right of the left edge of y" or "x's projection on the x-axis starts (has its infimum) to the right of where y's projection starts (has its infimum)."
- Similarly for the other constraints.

Given these interpretations, let's reason:
- From x B y, we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means "x's left edge is to the right of y's left edge."
- From y S z, we get infx(z) ≤ infx(y), which means "y's left edge is to the right of z's left edge."
- Combining these, by transitivity, "x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge," or infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

- From x B y, we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y), which means "x's right edge is to the left of y's right edge."
- From y S z, we get supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means "y's right edge is to the left of z's right edge."
- Combining these, by transitivity, "x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge," or supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

- From x B y, we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y), which means "x's top edge is below y's top edge."
- From y S z, we get supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means "y's top edge is below z's bottom edge."
- Combining these, by transitivity, "x's top edge is below z's bottom edge," or supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

These three derived constraints: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) collectively dictate that x is S of z.

But hold up, are both of these statements correct?
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) means "x's left edge is to the right of y's left edge."
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) means "x's right edge is to the left of y's right edge."

I think I'm confusing myself with the geometric interpretation. Let's go back to the basics.

- infx(y) is the infimum, or the lowest value, of the x-coordinate in the region y.
- supx(y) is the supremum, or the highest value, of the x-coordinate in the region y.

Given the bounding box of y, these two values, infx(y) and supx(y), are the left and right coordinates of the bounding box. Specifically, infx(y) is the left edge of the bounding box, and supx(y) is the right edge of the bounding box.

Alright. So here's what the formulas actually mean:

x B y means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x): The left edge of x's bounding box is at or to the right of the left edge of y's bounding box.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y): The right edge of x's bounding box is at or to the left of the right edge of y's bounding box.
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x): The bottom edge of x's bounding box is at or above the bottom edge of y's bounding box.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y): The top edge of x's bounding box is at or below the top edge of y's bounding box.

y S z means:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z): The top edge of y's bounding box is at or below the bottom edge of z's bounding box.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y): The left edge of y's bounding box is at or to the right of the left edge of z's bounding box.
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z): The right edge of y's bounding box is at or to the left of the right edge of z's bounding box.

Using transitivity, we can combine these to determine the constraints between x and z:

- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x): The left edge of x's bounding box is at or to the right of the left edge of z's bounding box.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z): The right edge of x's bounding box is at or to the left of the right edge of z's bounding box.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z): The top edge of x's bounding box is at or below the bottom edge of z's bounding box.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): The top edge of x's bounding box is at or below the bottom edge of z's bounding box.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x): The left edge of x's bounding box is at or to the right of the left edge of z's bounding box.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z): The right edge of x's bounding box is at or to the left of the right edge of z's bounding box.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): The top edge of x's bounding box is at or below the bottom edge of z's bounding box.
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): The right edge of x's bounding box is at or to the left of the left edge of z's bounding box.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): The top edge of x's bounding box is at or below the bottom edge of z's bounding box.
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x): The left edge of x's bounding box is at or to the right of the right edge of z's bounding box.

Huh, I think I've been overthinking this after all.

Let's directly redo this verification again. From the constraints we've established:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x): The left edge of x's bounding box is at or to the right of the left edge of z's bounding box.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z): The right edge of x's bounding box is at or to the left of the right edge of z's bounding box.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): The top edge of x's bounding box is at or below the bottom edge of z's bounding box.

These are precisely the criteria for x to be S of z.

For x to be SW of z, we would need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but this is not enforced by the constraints. Similarly, for x to be SE of z, we would need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is not enforced either.

So, from the given constraints, the only possible cardinal direction of x with respect to z is S.

But hold on, I think the above reasoning assumes x and y are both single connected regions, and not regions with multiple parts. Let's check if the problem statement says anything about the regions:

"Let us consider regions that are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk {(x, y): x^2 + y^2 <= 1}. The set of these regions will be denoted by REG. Regions in REG are closed, connected and have connected boundaries."

So the regions are indeed homeomorphic to a closed unit disk and have connected boundaries. So my reasoning is correct; the regions are single connected regions.

To recap, Intuitively, given a region z at the origin, a region y directly below z (in the S direction, which means the top edge of y is at or below the bottom edge of z, and y's left-right extent falls within z's left-right extent), and a region x that is contained within y's bounding box, the only possible cardinal direction of x with respect to z is S.

Let's double-check this one last time:

For cardinal direction S, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): The top edge of x is below or at the bottom edge of z.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x): The left edge of x is at or to the right of the left edge of z.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z): The right edge of x is at or to the left of the right edge of z.

Let's check if the given constraints enforce these conditions.

From the constraints we've derived:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z). This ensures supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x). This ensures infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). This ensures supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

All conditions for the cardinal direction S are satisfied. The constraints derived from "x B y" and "y S z" are consistent only with the relation "x S z".

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is S (South).

Wait let's go back to the constraints again.

Constraint 1: y S z --> infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
Constraint 2: x B y --> infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
From 1 and 2: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)

This derivation doesn't actually seem correct. Let me re-examine the formulas. According to the definition, a B b means infx(b) ≤ infx(a).

So x B y means infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means the left edge of x is at or to the right of the left edge of y.

y S z means infx(z) ≤ infx(y), which means the left edge of y is at or to the right of the left edge of z.

So we get infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means the left edge of x is at or to the right of the left edge of z. This satisfies the condition for S, not SE.

Similarly, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) satisfies the condition for S, not SW.

Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) also satisfies the condition for S, the relation "x S z" is the only consistent one.

Alright, so the possible relations between region x and region z is S.

Actually, let me recheck the relation "S" (South) more carefully.

a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

For x S z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): The top edge of x is below or at the bottom edge of z.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x): The left edge of x is at or to the right of the left edge of z.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z): The right edge of x is at or to the left of the right edge of z.

From the constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ensures supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

OK but let me revisit infx(y) ≤ infx(x). Does this have the interpretation "the left edge of x is at or to the right of the left edge of y"? Let's check the definition again.

a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

So, for a = x and b = y, we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which indeed means "the left edge of x is at or to the right of the left edge of y."

Similarly, From "y S z," we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y), which means "the left edge of y is at or to the right of the left edge of z."

Combining these, we get infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means "the left edge of x is at or to the right of the left edge of z." This translates to infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Wait, there's a subtle issue here. The formula is infx(b) ≤ infx(a) for a B b. Using names, this is infx(y) ≤ infx(x). But my interpretation is "the left edge of x is at or to the right of the left edge of y," which doesn't seem right given the formula.

Let me recheck the definition:

a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

This means the bounding box of a is inside the bounding box of b. Specifically:
- The left edge of a is at or to the right of the left edge of b: infx(b) ≤ infx(a).
- The right edge of a is at or to the left of the right edge of b: supx(a) ≤ supx(b).
- The bottom edge of a is at or above the bottom edge of b: infy(b) ≤ infy(a).
- The top edge of a is at or below the top edge of b: supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

So, for x B y, we have:
- The left edge of x is at or to the right of the left edge of y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x).
- The right edge of x is at or to the left of the right edge of y: supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- The bottom edge of x is at or above the bottom edge of y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- The top edge of x is at or below the top edge of y: supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

And for y S z, we have:
- The top edge of y is at or below the bottom edge of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
- The left edge of y is at or to the right of the left edge of z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y).
- The right edge of y is at or to the left of the right edge of z: supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

On further reflection, I realize I've been interpreting the formulas correctly all along.

So, from the constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x): The left edge of x is at or to the right of the left edge of z.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z): The right edge of x is at or to the left of the right edge of z.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z): The top edge of x is at or below the bottom edge of z.

These are the conditions for x S z, and they are all satisfied by the constraints.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is S (South).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I'll analyze the constraints from the given information.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is S of region z

Step 1: Understand the constraints from x B y.
When x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge isn't to the left of y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge isn't to the right of y's right edge)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom edge isn't below y's bottom edge)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top edge isn't above y's top edge)

Step 2: Understand the constraints from y S z.
When y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y's top edge is at or below z's bottom edge)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge)

Step 3: Derive constraints between x and z through transitivity.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge)

These constraints exactly match the definition of the S relation:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is S (South).
