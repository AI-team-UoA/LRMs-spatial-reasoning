PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step:

1. We're told that region x is W (West) of region y.
   - This means that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).

2. We're also told that region y is NE (Northeast) of region z.
   - This means that supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y).

Now, let's determine the possible relations between region x and region z using the constraints above.

First, let's consider the x-coordinates:
- From (1), we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
- From (2), we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
- From these two, we can't directly infer a relationship between supx(x) and supx(z) or between infx(x) and infx(z). Both supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z) are possible.

Now, let's consider the y-coordinates:
- From (1), we have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- From (2), we have supy(z) <= infy(y).
- From these, we can infer that supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This means that supy(z) <= infy(x).

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z:

1. NW (North West): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - But we can't guarantee that supx(x) <= infx(z), so NW might or might not be possible.

2. N (North): This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - But we can't guarantee the other conditions, so N might or might not be possible.

3. NE (Northeast): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - But we can't guarantee that supx(z) <= infx(x), so NE might or might not be possible.

4. W (West): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We can't guarantee any of these conditions, so W might or might not be possible.

5. B (Bounding Box): This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We can't guarantee any of these conditions, so B might or might not be possible.

6. E (East): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We can't guarantee any of these conditions, so E might or might not be possible.

7. SW (Southwest): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We can't guarantee any of these conditions, so SW might or might not be possible.

8. S (South): This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We can't guarantee any of these conditions, so S might or might not be possible.

9. SE (Southeast): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We can't guarantee any of these conditions, so SE might or might not be possible.

Hmm, but this isn't helping much because we're not able to guarantee most of the conditions. Let's take a different approach.

Let's think about the spatial configuration more visually:

- Region x is W of region y. This means x is to the left of y.
- Region y is NE of region z. This means y is to the top-right of z.

So the arrangement is roughly something like:
   y
x    z

Now, let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. x could be to the left of z (W). This is consistent with the given constraints.
2. x could be to the top-left of z (NW). This is consistent with the given constraints.
3. x could be above z (N). This is consistent with the given constraints.
4. x could even be to the top-right of z (NE), as long as it's still to the left of y.
5. x could be to the right of z (E), as long as it's still to the left of y.
6. x could be to the bottom-right of z (SE), but the constraints on y-coordinates might make this challenging.
7. x could be below z (S), but again, the constraints on y-coordinates could make this challenging.
8. x could be to the bottom-left of z (SW), though the constraints would need to be checked.
9. x could have a bounding box relation with z (B), but this would depend on specific coordinates.

Let's approach this more rigorously. We know:

- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-range is within y's y-range)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), so both x and z are to the left of y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y), thus supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x.

So, z is below x, and both are to the left of y. But we can't determine if x is to the left, right, or overlapping with z in terms of x-coordinates.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West): x is to the left and above z.
- N (North): x is directly above z.
- NE (North East): x is to the right and above z.
- W (West): x is to the left of z, and they overlap in the y-direction.
- B (Bounding Box): x contains z.
- E (East): x is to the right of z, and they overlap in the y-direction.

Let's verify each of these:

1. NW (North West): For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x). But we can't guarantee supx(x) <= infx(z) from the given constraints. So NW is a possibility.

2. N (North): For this, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x). But we can't guarantee the other two conditions from the given constraints. However, they are not contradicted either, so N is a possibility.

3. NE (North East): For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x). But we can't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x) from the given constraints. However, it's not contradicted either, so NE is a possibility.

4. W (West): For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x and they don't overlap in y. So W is not a possibility.

5. B (Bounding Box): For this, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x and they don't overlap in y. So B is not a possibility.

6. E (East): For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x and they don't overlap in y. So E is not a possibility.

7. SW (Southwest): For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x and not the other way around. So SW is not a possibility.

8. S (South): For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x and not the other way around. So S is not a possibility.

9. SE (Southeast): For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x and not the other way around. So SE is not a possibility.

After verifying each relation, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West)
- N (North)
- NE (North East)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning here. I think I was not thinking carefully in the y-dimension.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- Region y is NE of region z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y).

From these, we can deduce:
- Both x and z are to the left of y (in terms of x-coordinates).
- z is below y.
- x's y-range is within y's y-range.

But I can't directly infer a specific relation between x and z in the y-dimension from these constraints. I need to be more careful.

Ah, I think I was wrong previously. Let's reconsider.

From the given constraints, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-range is within y's y-range)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), so both x and z are to the left of y.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), thus supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x.

So, x is above z, and both are to the left of y. But we can't determine if x is to the left, right, or overlapping with z in terms of x-coordinates.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West): x is to the left and above z.
- N (North): x is directly above z.
- NE (North East): x is to the right and above z.

To verify, I'm going to use these constraints:
- NW: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- NE: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

For all three, we've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is above z. But we can't definitively say anything about the x-coordinates from the given constraints. So, all three (NW, N, NE) are possible relations between x and z.

Actually, I think I need to think even more carefully. Let's lay out the constraints one by one.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y:
  - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y in terms of x-coordinates)
  - infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of y is below or at the same level as the bottom of x, in terms of y-coordinates)
  - supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y, in terms of y-coordinates)

- Region y is NE of region z:
  - supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the left of y in terms of x-coordinates)
  - supy(z) <= infy(y) (the top of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y, in terms of y-coordinates)

From these, we can deduce:
- Both x and z are to the left of y in terms of x-coordinates.
- The top of z is below the bottom of y, and the bottom of y is below or at the same level as the bottom of x. Thus, the top of z is below the bottom of x, which means z is completely below x in terms of y-coordinates.

Let's check which cardinal direction relations are possible:

1. NW (North West): For this, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z in terms of x-coordinates)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x, in terms of y-coordinates)
   We've already established that z is completely below x, so the second condition is satisfied. If x is also to the left of z (which is a possibility based on our constraints), then NW is a possible relation.

2. N (North): For this, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x, in terms of y-coordinates)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left of z is to the left or at the same level as the left of x, in terms of x-coordinates)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right of x is to the left or at the same level as the right of z, in terms of x-coordinates)
   We've already established that z is completely below x, so the first condition is satisfied. If x and z overlap in terms of x-coordinates such that the left of z is to the left or at the same level as the left of x, and the right of x is to the left or at the same level as the right of z, then N is a possible relation.

3. NE (North East): For this, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (the right of z is to the left or at the same level as the left of x, in terms of x-coordinates)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x, in terms of y-coordinates)
   We've already established that z is completely below x, so the second condition is satisfied. If z is also to the left of x (which is a possibility based on our constraints), then NE is a possible relation.

Given the constraints, we can see that x and z can have various placements in the x-dimension, but z is always entirely below x in the y-dimension.

So, the possible relations are NW, N, and NE.

Hmm, I'm not entirely convinced yet. Let me reason through this one more time from scratch.

Given two constraints:
1. Region x is W of region y.
2. Region y is NE of region z.

The first constraint means:
- x is to the left of y,
- y and x overlap in y-coordinates in such a way that the bottom of y is below or at the same level as the bottom of x, and the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y.

The second constraint means:
- y is to the right and above z.

Now, let's visualize this:
- Region z is somewhere, and region y is to its northeast.
- Region x is to the west of region y.

Can we determine the position of x relative to z?

We know:
- x is to the left of y, and y is to the right of z. So, x is not necessarily to the right of z, nor to the left. It could be to the right, left, or overlapping in the x-dimension.
- y is above z, and x overlaps with y in the y-dimension. So, x could be above z, overlapping, or even below.

This suggests that there's no clear relationship between x and z based on the given constraints.

But actually I need to be even more careful with how I apply the constraints.

Let's go through the definitions of W and NE:

- x W y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
  - This means x is to the left of y, and x's y-range is contained within y's y-range.

- y NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
  - This means y is to the right and above z.

From these, we can deduce:
- x and z are both to the left of y.
- z is below y.
- The y-range of x is contained within the y-range of y.

But we can't directly infer a relationship between x and z in the x-dimension. However, in the y-dimension, since z is below y and x's y-range is contained within y's y-range, z is below at least a part of x. But we can't say for sure if z is entirely below x.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- NW: If x is to the left of z and z is entirely below x.
- N: If x overlaps with z in the x-dimension and z is entirely below x.
- NE: If x is to the right of z and z is entirely below x.
- W: If x is to the left of z and x overlaps with z in the y-dimension.
- B: If x contains z.
- E: If x is to the right of z and x overlaps with z in the y-dimension.

But let's re-examine these using the original constraints:

- x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y): Both x and z are to the left of y.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of y, which is below or at the same level as the bottom of x. Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This implies z is entirely below x.

Given these refined deductions, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW: If x is to the left of z and z is entirely below x.
- N: If x overlaps with z in the x-dimension and z is entirely below x.
- NE: If x is to the right of z and z is entirely below x.

But I can't determine which of these is the case without more specific constraints. I also realize the error in what I said when I claimed that "z is below at least a part of x, but we can't say for sure if z is entirely below x". Actually, we can indeed determine that z is entirely below x using the constraints.

So in summary, the possible relations between x and z are NW, N, or NE.

Actually, let me go through the possible cardinal direction relations one by one to be sure:

1. NW (North West): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Whether supx(x) <= infx(z) holds depends on the specific positions of x and z. It's not guaranteed by the given constraints, but it's not contradicted either.
   So, NW is a possible relation.

2. N (North): This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Whether infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) hold depend on the specific positions of x and z. They're not guaranteed by the given constraints, but they're not contradicted either.
   So, N is a possible relation.

3. NE (North East): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Whether supx(z) <= infx(x) holds depends on the specific positions of x and z. It's not guaranteed by the given constraints, but it's not contradicted either.
   So, NE is a possible relation.

4. W (West): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - If supy(z) <= infy(x), then it's not possible for supy(x) <= supy(z) (because infy(x) is by definition less than or equal to supy(x), so supy(x) > supy(z)). Thus, the conditions for W are contradicted.
   So, W is not a possible relation.

5. B (Bounding Box): This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - If supy(z) <= infy(x), then it's not possible for supy(x) <= supy(z) (for the same reason as in the W case). Thus, the conditions for B are contradicted.
   So, B is not a possible relation.

6. E (East): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - If supy(z) <= infy(x), then it's not possible for supy(x) <= supy(z) (for the same reason as in the W and B cases). Thus, the conditions for E are contradicted.
   So, E is not a possible relation.

7. SW (Southwest): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - If supy(z) <= infy(x), then it's not possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) (because supx(y) is by definition greater than or equal to infy(x), so supy(x) > infy(z)). Thus, the conditions for SW are contradicted.
   So, SW is not a possible relation.

8. S (South): This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - If supy(z) <= infy(x), then it's not possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) (for the same reason as in the SW case). Thus, the conditions for S are contradicted.
   So, S is not a possible relation.

9. SE (Southeast): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - If supy(z) <= infy(x), then it's not possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) (for the same reason as in the SW and S cases). Thus, the conditions for SE are contradicted.
   So, SE is not a possible relation.

After going through all the possible cardinal direction relations, I've verified that the only possible relations between x and z are NW, N, and NE.

Actually I realized that I introduced a false constraint, I'm not sure if there's an implied assumption that the y-axis increases upwards (i.e., north). But when I say something like supy(z) < infy(x), it doesn't mean that z is below x, it just means that the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than the minimum y-coordinate of x, so they're separated along the y-axis. But which one is above/below the other depends on the orientation of the y-axis.

Let me double-check this by going back to the definitions.

We have
x W y iff supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
y NE z iff supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

NE stands for Northeast, which is to the top-right. So if y is to the northeast of z, then y is to the top-right of z. This means that y has larger x-coordinates and larger y-coordinates than z. Indeed, supx(z) <= infx(y) means that y is to the right of z, and supy(z) <= infy(y) means that y is above z. So the y-axis indeed increases upwards.

Similarly, W stands for West, which is to the left. So if x is to the west of y, then x is to the left of y. This means that x has smaller x-coordinates than y. Indeed, supx(x) <= infx(y) means that x is to the left of y. The constraints infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) mean that x's y-range is within y's y-range.

OK so I wasn't mistaken earlier. Now let's proceed with the analysis again:

Given:
- x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y): Both x and z are to the left of y.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of y, which is below or at the same level as the bottom of x. Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This implies z is entirely below x.

So, z is entirely below x, and both x and z are to the left of y. But we can't determine if x is to the left, right, or overlapping with z in terms of x-coordinates.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (North West): x is to the left and above z.
- N (North): x is directly above z.
- NE (North East): x is to the right and above z.

OK, let's confirm one last time. Given:
- x W y: This means x is to the west (left) of y, and x's y-range is contained within y's y-range. Formally, supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y NE z: This means y is to the northeast (top-right) of z. Formally, supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y).

From these, we can deduce:
- Both x and z are to the left of y (because supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)).
- z is entirely below y (because supy(z) <= infy(y)).
- The y-range of x is contained within the y-range of y (because infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)).

Now, here's the key deduction: Since supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), it follows that supy(z) <= infy(x). This means the top of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x, which means z is entirely below x.

Since z is entirely below x, but we can't determine their relative positions in the x-dimension, the possible relations are NW, N, and NE.

To check this, let's verify the constraints for each of these relations:

NW(x, z): This means x is to the northwest of z. The constraints are:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This means x is to the left of z. This is not guaranteed by the given constraints, but it's not contradicted either.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This means z is below x. We've already established this is true.
So, NW is a possible relation.

N(x, z): This means x is to the north of z. The constraints are:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): This means x's x-range is contained within z's x-range. This is not guaranteed by the given constraints, but it's not contradicted either.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This means z is below x. We've already established this is true.
So, N is a possible relation.

NE(x, z): This means x is to the northeast of z. The constraints are:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This means x is to the right of z. This is not guaranteed by the given constraints, but it's not contradicted either.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This means z is below x. We've already established this is true.
So, NE is a possible relation.

Given the constraints, these are the only possible relations. Relations like W, B, E, SW, S, and SE would all be contradicted by the fact that z is entirely below x.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW, N, and NE.

And I'm confident with this answer.

Possible relations:
- NW (North West)
- N (North)
- NE (North East)

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction constraints:

1. When x is W of y, we know:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom is below or at x's bottom)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is below or at y's top)

2. When y is NE of z, we know:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's top is below y's bottom)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
- Both x and z are to the left of y
- Since supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is completely below x

However, we cannot determine the exact horizontal relationship between x and z - x could be to the left of z, overlapping with z, or to the right of z in terms of x-coordinates.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (if x is to the left of z)
- N (if x is directly above z)
- NE (if x is to the right of z)
