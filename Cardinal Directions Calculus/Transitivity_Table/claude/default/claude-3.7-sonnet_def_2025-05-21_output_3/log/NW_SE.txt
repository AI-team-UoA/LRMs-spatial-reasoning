PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this step-by-step:

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Let me think about the definitions:
- x NW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

So we have:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x NW y)
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y)
3. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)
4. supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SE z)

Now, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

From 1 and 3, we can derive:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

This means both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative positions on the x-axis aren't constrained by these inequalities alone.

From 2 and 4, we can derive:
supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means both x and z are above y, but their relative positions on the y-axis aren't fully constrained.

Let's analyze the possible cases:

First, I need to determine if x could be NW of z:
For x NW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our given constraints, we can't derive either of these directly. So x can be NW of z, but it's not guaranteed.

Similarly, let's check other possible relations:

1. x N z?
   For x N z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   From the given constraints, we can't determine this for sure.

2. x NE z?
   For x NE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   From 3, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y), and with 1, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   But this doesn't guarantee supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x can be NE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

3. x E z?
   For x E z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   From the given constraints, we can't determine this for sure.

4. x SE z?
   For x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   From 3, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but with 1, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   It's possible that supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but it's not guaranteed.
   
   From 4, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   But we don't have direct constraints on supy(x) and infy(z).
   So, x can be SE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

5. x S z?
   For x S z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   From the given constraints, we can't determine this for sure.

6. x SW z?
   For x SW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   From 4, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   But we don't have direct constraints on supy(x) and infy(z).
   
   Similarly, we don't have direct constraints on supx(x) and infx(z).
   So, x can be SW of z, but it's not guaranteed.

7. x W z?
   For x W z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   From the given constraints, we can't determine this for sure.

8. x B z?
   For x B z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   From the given constraints, we can't determine this for sure.

It seems like without additional constraints, x could have any cardinal direction relation with z.

Let me reconsider this. Let's keep our constraints in mind:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x NW y)
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y)
3. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)
4. supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SE z)

Wait, there's something weird here. Let's revisit the definitions.

x NW y means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)

y SE z means:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, let's think about the possible relative positions of x and z:

1. On the x-axis:
   - x is to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))
   - z is to the left of y (supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
   So both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative positions to each other can vary.

2. On the y-axis:
   - x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
   - z is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))
   So both x and z are above y, but their relative positions to each other can vary.

Given these constraints, x and z can be in various cardinal directions with respect to each other. 

When determining the relation between x and z, we need to consider the constraints on the bounds of x and z:

x is NW of y, so:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)

y is SE of z, so:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. x NW z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From our constraints, we can't directly determine if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - Similarly, we can't directly determine if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   So, x can be NW of z, but it's not guaranteed.

2. x N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - From our constraints, we can't directly determine if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), or supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   So, x can be N of z, but it's not guaranteed.

3. x NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From the constraints, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - But this doesn't guarantee supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - Similarly, we can't directly determine if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   So, x can be NE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

4. And so on for the other directions...

Given the constraints, it seems like x and z can have any of the nine cardinal direction relations. But let me think about this more carefully.

Actually, let's reason about this from a visual perspective. If x is NW of y and y is SE of z, then in a visual diagram:

```
    z
     \
      \
       \
        y
         \
          \
           \
            x
```

In this diagram, z is NE of y, y is SW of z, y is NE of x, and x is SW of y.

But wait, the question says that x is NW of y and y is SE of z. Let me redraw this:

```
    z
     \
      \
       \
        y
       /
      /
     /
    x
```

From this visual representation, it seems like x could be W of z, NW of z, or N of z.

But I'm being too restrictive here. The only constraints we have are:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
3. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
4. supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we know that both x and z are to the left of y and above y. But their positions relative to each other are not fully constrained.

For instance, x could be to the right of z (making it E, NE, or SE of z) or to the left of z (making it W, NW, or SW of z). Similarly, x could be above z (making it N, NE, or NW of z) or below z (making it S, SE, or SW of z).

Let me redo this more systematically by considering the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis and y-axis.

1. Relative position on x-axis:
   - If infx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is westerly of z.
   - If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(z) ≤ supx(x), then x is easterly of z.
   - If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is within the x-extent of z.
   - If infx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supx(z) ≤ supx(x), then z is within the x-extent of x.

2. Relative position on y-axis:
   - If infy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is southerly of z.
   - If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ supy(x), then x is northerly of z.
   - If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is within the y-extent of z.
   - If infy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supy(z) ≤ supy(x), then z is within the y-extent of x.

Given the constraints, can we narrow down the possibilities?

From constraints 1 and 3, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)

From these, we can derive that both x and z are to the left of y. However, we can't determine the relative position of x and z on the x-axis.

Similarly, from constraints 2 and 4:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

We derive that both x and z are above y, but we can't determine their relative position on the y-axis.

Wait, I think I'm still being a bit sloppy. Let's be very clear about the constraints and implications.

Given:
- x NW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- y SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we have:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   This means both x and z are to the left of y.
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   This means both x and z are above y.

But these constraints don't directly tell us the relationship between x and z. Let's consider each possible relation:

1. x NW z: This means x is to the NW of z, i.e., x is both to the left of z and above z.
   For this, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   From the given constraints, we can't definitively say if this is true.

Let's redo this still more systematically, using the bounding boxes of x and z.

The bounding box of region x is defined by the straight lines x=infx(x), x=supx(x), y=infy(x), and y=supy(x).
The bounding box of region z is defined by the straight lines x=infx(z), x=supx(z), y=infy(z), and y=supy(z).

For x to have a cardinal direction relation R with respect to z, certain constraints on these bounds must be satisfied.

Given the constraints:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x NW y)
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y)
3. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)
4. supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SE z)

Let's determine the relative positions of the bounding boxes of x and z.

On the x-axis, both x and z are to the left of y (from constraints 1 and 3). But the exact positions of x and z relative to each other are not constrained. So, x could be to the left of z, or z could be to the left of x, or they could overlap on the x-axis.

On the y-axis, both x and z are above y (from constraints 2 and 4). Again, the exact positions of x and z relative to each other are not constrained. So, x could be above z, or z could be above x, or they could overlap on the y-axis.

Given these possibilities, let's enumerate the potential cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. If x is to the left of z and above z, then x is NW of z.
2. If x is to the left of z and at the same height as z, then x is W of z.
3. If x is to the left of z and below z, then x is SW of z.
4. If x is at the same position as z on the x-axis and above z, then x is N of z.
5. If x is at the same position as z on both axes (or if x and z overlap), then x is B of z.
6. If x is at the same position as z on the x-axis and below z, then x is S of z.
7. If x is to the right of z and above z, then x is NE of z.
8. If x is to the right of z and at the same height as z, then x is E of z.
9. If x is to the right of z and below z, then x is SE of z.

Wait, this is still a bit sloppy. Let me reconsider by thinking about the physical positioning directly.

Given:
- x NW y: x is to the northwest of y.
- y SE z: y is to the southeast of z.

This means:
- x is to the left and above y.
- y is to the right and below z.

If y is to the right and below z, then z is to the left and above y. So, both x and z are to the left and above y. But their relative positions to each other aren't directly constrained.

Let's once again think spatially:

- x is NW of y, which means x is positioned to the left and above y.
- y is SE of z, which means y is positioned to the right and below z. In other words, z is to the left and above y.

So both x and z are positioned to the left and above y. But the exact relative positions of x and z to each other are not fully determined.

x and z have the following possible cardinal direction relations:

1. x NW z: x is to the left and above z. This is possible.
2. x N z: x is directly above z. This is possible.
3. x NE z: x is to the right and above z. This is possible.
4. x W z: x is directly to the left of z. This is possible.
5. x B z: x overlaps or is inside z. This is possible.
6. x E z: x is directly to the right of z. This is possible.
7. x SW z: x is to the left and below z. This is possible.
8. x S z: x is directly below z. This is possible.
9. x SE z: x is to the right and below z. This is possible.

Wait, this is too broad. Let's consider a simple example.

If x is the point (0, 3), y is the point (3, 0), and z is the point (0, 3), then x is NW of y, y is SE of z, and x is B of z (since x and z are the same point).

If x is the point (0, 3), y is the point (3, 0), and z is the point (-2, 5), then x is NW of y, y is SE of z, and x is SE of z.

If x is the point (0, 3), y is the point (3, 0), and z is the point (2, 2), then x is NW of y, y is SE of z, and x is NW of z.

So different cardinal directions are indeed possible. But can we be more precise about the possible relations? Let's try to narrow it down.

Given:
- x is NW of y, which means x is positioned to the left and above y (i.e., in the quadrant to the NW of y).
- y is SE of z, which means y is positioned to the right and below z.

Spatially, this means:
- x is in the NW quadrant with respect to y.
- y is in the SE quadrant with respect to z.

Hmm, that actually does seem to constrain the possible positions of x and z.

Picture this: y is in the SE quadrant with respect to z. If we draw a straight line from z to y, then y is to the bottom-right of z.

Similarly, x is in the NW quadrant with respect to y. If we draw a straight line from y to x, then x is to the top-left of y.

So, if we connected z, y, and x with straight lines, we'd move from z, then go to the bottom-right to reach y, and then go to the top-left to reach x. Overall, we're making a kind of zigzag.

Depending on the exact positions of z, y, and x, we can have different cardinal directions for the relation between x and z.

For instance, if z is to the left of both x and y, x can be E or NE of z. If z is to the right of both x and y, x can be W or NW of z. If z is above both x and y, x can be S or SE or SW of z. If z is below both x and y, x can be N or NE or NW of z. And if x and z are positioned such that they overlap or are the same, then x can be B of z.

Wait, I need to be more systematic. Let's consider a grid.

Let's split locations into 9 grid cells:

```
 NW | N | NE
 ---+---+---
  W | B | E
 ---+---+---
 SW | S | SE
```

The position of y is at cell B (the center).

The position of x, given that x is NW of y, is at cell NW.

The position of z, given that y is SE of z, is at one of {NW, N, NE, W, B}. This is because y is in the SE direction from z, so z must be in one of the positions from which SE makes sense.

Now, let's determine the relation of x to z for each possible position of z:

1. If z is at NW, then x can be B, E, SE of z. (Because both x and z are in the NW cell with respect to y, but their exact positions within that cell can vary.)
2. If z is at N, then x can be SW, W, B, S, SE of z. (Because x is in the NW cell and z is in the N cell with respect to y.)
3. If z is at NE, then x can be SW, W, S of z. (Because x is in the NW cell and z is in the NE cell with respect to y.)
4. If z is at W, then x can be NE, N, B, E, SE of z. (Because x is in the NW cell and z is in the W cell with respect to y.)
5. If z is at B, then x can be NW of z. (Because x is in the NW cell and z is at the center with respect to y.)

Hmm wait, but we know that the cardinal direction relations are based on a slightly different model than the grid. They are based on the bounding boxes of the regions. So I'll use the definitions from the instructions.

Let me restart.

Given:
- x NW y: means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y SE z: means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, I want to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let's check each possible cardinal direction relation:

1. x B z: This means infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   Given the constraints, I can't deduce if this relation holds or not. For instance, x and z could be positioned in a way that x is completely inside z, or vice versa, or they can overlap, or they can be disjoint. The constraints don't prohibit any of these.

2. x N z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   From the constraints, I can't deduce if supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The constraints only tell us that both x and z are above y, not their relative positions to each other. So x can be to the north of z, but it's not guaranteed.

3. x NE z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   From the constraints, I know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y). But that doesn't tell me the relation between supx(z) and infx(x). So x can be to the northeast of z, but it's not guaranteed.

4. x E z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From the constraints, I can't deduce if these relations hold. For instance, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) isn't guaranteed from the constraints. Similarly for infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So x can be to the east of z, but it's not guaranteed.

5. x SE z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   From the constraints, I can't deduce if these relations hold. For instance, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) isn't guaranteed from the constraints. Similarly for supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So x can be to the southeast of z, but it's not guaranteed.

6. x S z: This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   From the constraints, I know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). But that doesn't tell me the relation between supy(x) and infy(z). So x can be to the south of z, but it's not guaranteed.

7. x SW z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   From the constraints, I can't deduce if these relations hold. For instance, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) isn't guaranteed from the constraints. Similarly for supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So x can be to the southwest of z, but it's not guaranteed.

8. x W z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From the constraints, I can't deduce if these relations hold. For instance, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) isn't guaranteed from the constraints. Similarly for infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So x can be to the west of z, but it's not guaranteed.

9. x NW z: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   From the constraints, I can't deduce if these relations hold. For instance, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) isn't guaranteed from the constraints. Similarly for supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So x can be to the northwest of z, but it's not guaranteed.

So, it seems that, given the constraints from x NW y and y SE z, any of the 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z. The constraints don't prohibit any of them.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's reconsidering the problem from a geometric perspective. We have:

1. x NW y: x is to the northwest of y.
2. y SE z: y is to the southeast of z.

In a geometric sense, this doesn't restrict the relationship between x and z. For instance, consider the following scenario:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (1, -1) (i.e., to the southeast of z)
- x at (0, 1) (i.e., to the northwest of y)

In this setup, x is N of z.

Alternatively, consider:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (1, -1) (i.e., to the southeast of z)
- x at (-2, -1) (i.e., to the northwest of y)

In this setup, x is W of z.

I'm going to try yet again, but with a slightly different approach.

Let's place y at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. 

Given that x is NW of y, x could be at any point in the quadrant where all points have negative x-coordinate and positive y-coordinate.

Given that y is SE of z, z could be at any point in the quadrant where all points have negative x-coordinate and positive y-coordinate.

Both x and z are in the same quadrant with respect to y. But their positions relative to each other aren't constrained. So x and z can have any of the 9 cardinal direction relations.

Wait, I think I've been misinterpreting the setup. Let's go back to the original definitions:

- x NW y: means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y SE z: means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From x NW y:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) - This means x is to the left of y.
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) - This means x is above y.

From y SE z:
3. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) - This means y is to the right of z (or z is to the left of y).
4. supy(y) ≤ infy(z) - This means y is below z (or z is above y).

So, both x and z are to the left of y, and both are above y. But their relative positions to each other aren't constrained.

Let's check each of the 9 cardinal direction relations to see if any are ruled out:

1. x B z: This is possible. x and z could overlap, or one could be inside the other.
2. x N z: This is possible. x could be directly above z.
3. x NE z: This is possible. x could be to the right and above z (even while both are to the left of y).
4. x E z: This is possible. x could be directly to the right of z.
5. x SE z: This is possible. x could be to the right and below z.
6. x S z: This is possible. x could be directly below z.
7. x SW z: This is possible. x could be to the left and below z.
8. x W z: This is possible. x could be directly to the left of z.
9. x NW z: This is possible. x could be to the left and above z.

It seems like none of the 9 cardinal direction relations are ruled out. They are all possible.

No, wait. Let me think again. I think I was overthinking this.

Given:
- x NW y: x is to the northwest of y.
- y SE z: y is to the southeast of z.

If y is to the southeast of z, then z is to the northwest of y. So both x and z are to the northwest of y. But their positions relative to each other can vary.

Let's consider some scenarios to get a clearer picture:

Scenario 1:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-1, 1) (i.e., to the northwest of y)
- z at (-2, 2) (i.e., to the northwest of y, such that y is to the southeast of z)

In this scenario, x is SE of z.

Scenario 2:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-2, 1) (i.e., to the northwest of y)
- z at (-1, 2) (i.e., to the northwest of y, such that y is to the southeast of z)

In this scenario, x is SW of z.

Scenario 3:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-2, 2) (i.e., to the northwest of y)
- z at (-2, 1) (i.e., to the northwest of y, such that y is to the southeast of z)

In this scenario, x is N of z.

Scenario 4:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-1, 2) (i.e., to the northwest of y)
- z at (-2, 2) (i.e., to the northwest of y, such that y is to the southeast of z)

In this scenario, x is E of z.

Scenario 5:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-2, 2) (i.e., to the northwest of y)
- z at (-1, 1) (i.e., to the northwest of y, such that y is to the southeast of z)

In this scenario, x is NW of z.

Hmm, that gives 5 possible relations already. Let me try to think of examples for the others.

Scenario 6:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-2, 2) (i.e., to the northwest of y)
- z at (-2, 2) (i.e., to the northwest of y, such that y is to the southeast of z)

In this scenario, x is B of z (they're at the same location).

Scenario 7:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-2, 1) (i.e., to the northwest of y)
- z at (-1, 1) (i.e., to the northwest of y, such that y is to the southeast of z)

In this scenario, x is W of z.

Scenario 8:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-1, 2) (i.e., to the northwest of y)
- z at (-1, 1) (i.e., to the northwest of y, such that y is to the southeast of z)

In this scenario, x is N of z.

Scenario 9:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-1, 1) (i.e., to the northwest of y)
- z at (-1, 2) (i.e., to the northwest of y, such that y is to the southeast of z)

In this scenario, x is S of z.

But wait, I think I've been working with a misinterpreted understanding of the cardinal directions. The cardinal directions are defined based on the bounding boxes of the regions, not just on their positions.

Let me go back to the original definitions and think about this again.

For simplicity, let's assume that x, y, and z are points. This doesn't lose generality because the single-tile cardinal direction relations are defined based on the bounding boxes.

Given:
- x NW y: x is to the northwest of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- y SE z: y is to the southeast of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

From these, we can infer:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y): Both x and z are to the left of y.
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z): Both x and z are above y.

Given that both x and z are to the left of y and above y, their positions relative to each other can vary, allowing for any of the 9 cardinal direction relations. 

Let's verify this with a few examples:

Example 1:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-1, 1)
- z at (-2, 2)

In this case, x is SE of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), which is one of the 9 relations.

Example 2:
- y at (0, 0)
- x at (-2, 1)
- z at (-1, 2)

In this case, x is SW of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), which is another one of the 9 relations.

I think I've verified that all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

So the answer is:
N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is NW of y, which means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SE of z, which means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
1. Both x and z are to the left of y (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
2. Both x and z are above y (since supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

However, the relative positions of x and z to each other are not constrained by this information. They could be positioned in any arrangement while still satisfying the given conditions.

Therefore, all cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
