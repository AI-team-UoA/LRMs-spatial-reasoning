PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what we know:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is S of region z

We want to figure out the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's use the definitions provided to understand what these relations mean geometrically.

When x is NW of y, it means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

When y is S of z, it means:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is not to the left of z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is not to the right of z's right edge)

Now let's think about what this implies for the relationship between x and z.

From x being NW of y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

From y being S of z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is not to the left of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is not to the right of z)

Now, putting these together to find the relationship between x and z:

First, let's think about the horizontal relationship:
- We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- We know infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is not to the left of z)

Combining these, we don't get a clear relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z. x could be entirely to the left of z, or x and z could overlap in the x-direction.

Now, let's think about the vertical relationship:
- We know supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- We know supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we know that both x and z are above y, but we don't know their vertical relationship with each other. x could be above z, below z, or they could overlap in the y-direction.

Let's consider all possible cases:

Case 1: x is to the left of z and above z.
This would make x NW of z.

Case 2: x is to the left of z and at the same vertical level as z (overlapping in y-direction).
This would make x W of z.

Case 3: x is to the left of z and below z.
This would make x SW of z.

Case 4: x overlaps with z in the x-direction and is above z.
This would make x N of z.

Case 5: x overlaps with z in both x and y directions.
This would make x B of z.

Case 6: x overlaps with z in the x-direction and is below z.
This would make x S of z.

Case 7: x is to the right of z and above z.
This would make x NE of z.

Case 8: x is to the right of z and at the same vertical level as z.
This would make x E of z.

Case 9: x is to the right of z and below z.
This would make x SE of z.

However, not all of these cases are consistent with our given constraints. Let's analyze further.

From our constraints, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is not to the left of z)

Combining these: supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
But this doesn't tell us if x is to the left of z, z is to the left of x, or they overlap in the x-direction. We need to be more careful.

Let's represent the regions on a Cartesian plane and think about the constraints more visually.

Region y is S of region z:
- This means y is below z.
- The x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z. 

Region x is NW of region y:
- This means x is to the northwest of y, i.e., x is above and to the left of y.

Hmm, but I'm struggling to reason about the constraints algebraically.

Let's go back to the definitions and constraints, and see what we can deduce.

x is NW of y, which means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

y is S of z, which means:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's see if we can determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. NW relation: x is NW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   From our constraints, we don't know if supx(x) <= infx(z), so NW is possible.
   We also don't know the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x), so this doesn't rule out NW.

2. N relation: x is N of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   Again, we don't have enough information to rule this out.

3. NE relation: x is NE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   We don't have enough information to rule this out either.

Ok, I realize I'm struggling with the algebraic reasoning because the given constraints don't fully determine the relation between x and z. Let's step back and think more generally.

Given that x is NW of y and y is S of z, what do we know?
- x is to the northwest of y.
- y is to the south of z.

We can deduce that y is below z. And x is to the northwest of y, meaning x is above and to the left of y.

Combining these, x is to the northwest of a region that is below z. This still leaves multiple possibilities for the relationship between x and z.

Actually, let's try a more visual approach. Imagine we fix the position of y, and look at where z and x can be:

- z: Must be somewhere above y, and its x-extent must contain y's x-extent. z's left edge is not to the right of y's left edge, and z's right edge is not to the left of y's right edge.
- x: Must be somewhere to the northwest of y, which means it's above and to the left of y.

Given these constraints, where can x be relative to z?

Let's list the possibilities:

1. If x is far enough to the left, it can be to the left of z.
2. If x is high enough, it can be above z.

Let's draw this out with some simple diagrams:

Consider these possible configurations:

Configuration 1:
```
    x       z
        y
```
Here, x is NW of y, and y is S of z, and x is W of z.

Configuration 2:
```
    x   z
        y
```
Here, x is NW of y, y is S of z, and x is NW of z.

Configuration 3:
```
        x
    z
        y
```
Here, x is NW of y, y is S of z, and x is NE of z.

Configuration 4:
```
      x
    z
        y
```
Here, x is NW of y, y is S of z, and x is N of z.

Actually, I think I'm not reasoning consistently here because I've drawn the regions as points, but the definitions are for regions. 

Let's focus on the cardinal directions. Given that x is NW of y and y is S of z, what are the possible cardinal directions between x and z?

First, let me clarify the cardinal directions in terms of the relative positions:
- N: North
- NE: Northeast
- E: East
- SE: Southeast
- S: South
- SW: Southwest
- W: West
- NW: Northwest
- B: Bounding box (contained within)

From the given constraints:
- x is NW of y, which means x is to the northwest of y.
- y is S of z, which means y is to the south of z.

Let's systematically analyze the possible relative positions of x and z:

1. If x is far enough to the left and above y, and z is directly above y, then x is to the west of z. This corresponds to the W relation.

2. If x is far enough to the left and directly above y, and z is slightly to the right above y, then x is to the northwest of z. This corresponds to the NW relation.

3. If x is directly above y, and z is far enough to the right above y, then x is to the north of z. This corresponds to the N relation.

Hmm but this is still not a systematic approach.

Actually, this is still not a systematic approach. I need to consider the regions as regions, not as points, and use the definitions provided.

I'll try a different approach. Let me start with the constraints and see what they imply for the relationship between x and z.

We know:
- x is NW of y, which means:
  * supx(x) <= infx(y)
  * supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is S of z, which means:
  * supy(y) <= infy(z)
  * infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's explore the possible relations between x and z.

For the W relation, we need:
* supx(x) <= infx(z)
* infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints:
* supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW of y)
* infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S of z)

These don't tell us if supx(x) <= infx(z).

This approach is also getting complex. Let me try another approach.

Actually, I think the easier approach is to explicitly check each of the nine possible relations between x and z (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) and see if they're consistent with our constraints.

Let's go through them one by one:

1. N relation: x is N of z if:
   * supy(z) <= infy(x)
   * infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   Is this consistent with our constraints? Let's see:
   * From x NW of y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x)
   * From y S of z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z)
   * Together, we don't directly get supy(z) <= infy(x).

   Also, from x NW of y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
   From y S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).
   Together, we don't know if infx(z) <= infx(x) or supx(x) <= supx(z).

   So, the N relation is possible.

Let me think about this more concretely. Imagine we pin down regions y and z:

Given y is S of z, it would be somewhere directly below z, like this:
```
    z
    y
```

Now, given x is NW of y, it would be somewhere to the northwest of y, like this:
```
  x
      y
```

Combining:
```
    z
  x
      y
```

In this configuration, x is indeed to the northwest of z (NW relation).

But if x is a bit more to the right, it could be directly to the north of z (N relation):
```
    z
     x
      y
```

And if x is more to the left, it could be to the west of z (W relation):
```
  x z
      y
```

I think these three relations (NW, N, W) are the most obviously consistent with our constraints. 

Let's check the remaining six (NE, E, SE, S, SW, B):

4. NE relation: x is NE of z if:
   * supx(z) <= infx(x)
   * supy(z) <= infy(x)

   From x NW of y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
   From y S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
   Together, supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(z).
   This doesn't tell us if supx(z) <= infx(x).

   From x NW of y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
   From y S of z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).
   Together, we don't directly get supy(z) <= infy(x).

   So, the NE relation is possible.

5. E relation: x is E of z if:
   * supx(z) <= infx(x)
   * infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From the discussion above, we don't know if supx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   From x NW of y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
   From y S of z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).
   Together, we don't directly know the relation between infy(z) and infy(x) or between supy(x) and supy(z).

   So, the E relation is possible.

6. SE relation: x is SE of z if:
   * supx(z) <= infx(x)
   * supy(x) <= infy(z)

   From the discussion above, we don't know if supx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   From x NW of y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
   From y S of z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).
   Together, we have supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z)).
   This doesn't tell us if supy(x) <= infy(z).

   So, the SE relation is possible.

7. S relation: x is S of z if:
   * supy(x) <= infy(z)
   * infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   From x NW of y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
   From y S of z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).
   Together, we have supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z)).
   This doesn't tell us if supy(x) <= infy(z).

   From the discussion above, we don't know if infx(z) <= infx(x) or supx(x) <= supx(z).

   So, the S relation is possible.

8. SW relation: x is SW of z if:
   * supx(x) <= infx(z)
   * supy(x) <= infy(z)

   From x NW of y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
   From y S of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).
   Together, we don't directly know if supx(x) <= infx(z).

   From the discussion above, we don't know if supy(x) <= infy(z).

   So, the SW relation is possible.

9. B relation: x is B of z if:
   * infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   * infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From the discussions above, we don't have enough constraints to determine if these conditions are met.

   So, the B relation is possible.

Actually, this approach isn't being very conclusive. Let's try to be more systematic.

Given the constraints:
- x is NW of y, which means:
  * supx(x) <= infx(y)
  * supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is S of z, which means:
  * supy(y) <= infy(z)
  * infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's focus on the specific cases and see if they can be ruled out based on the constraints.

For example, can x be S of z? This would require supy(x) <= infy(z). But from our constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z). These don't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, we can't rule out the S relation based on the given constraints.

Similarly, for the other relations, the constraints don't rule out any of the nine relations.

But intuitively, it feels like some configurations should be ruled out.

Let me think about it from a different angle. The fact that x is NW of y and y is S of z means that:
- x is at the NW corner of y.
- y is at the S corner of z.

Imagine z is fixed. Then y is directly below z, and x is to the northwest of y. if I place these on a grid, what do I get?

```
    z z z
      y
  x
```

From this visualization, it seems clear that x can be NW, W, or even SW of z.

Let's try it from another angle. What if x is NE of z? This would mean supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). is this consistent with our constraints?

From x NW of y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y S of z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

If x is NE of z, then supx(z) <= infx(x). But from our constraints, supx(x) <= infx(y). This gives supx(z) <= infx(x) <= infx(y). But from y S of z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y). Combining, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y). This isn't necessarily a contradiction because it could just mean z is very narrow in the x-direction.

So, x can be NE of z, but only if z is very narrow.

Let's try again.

Given the constraints:
- x is NW of y, which means x is to the northwest of y.
- y is S of z, which means y is to the south of z.

Where can x be relative to z?

I'll approach this more visually. Imagine we pin y at a specific location, and then place z such that y is S of z, and x such that x is NW of y.

```
    z z z
    z z z
    
      y
      
  x
```

From this visualization, it's clear that x can be:
- W of z
- NW of z
- SW of z
- N of z
- NE of z
- S of z
- B of z
- E of z
- SE of z

Actually, x can be in any cardinal direction relative to z.

But this doesn't feel right. Let me step back and review the definitions again.

Let's go through the conditions for each direction:

x is NW of y if:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

y is S of z if:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-extent is contained within z's x-extent)

Hmm, with these constraints, it's not necessarily the case that x can be in any cardinal direction relative to z. 

Let's think about it more systematically, considering the definitions of the cardinal directions.

For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Wait a minute, when I say "x is above y", it means there's some vertical separation between them, not just a small overlap. 

let's draw this differently.

if y is S of z, then:
```
   z z z z
   
   y y y
```

if x is NW of y, then:
```
 x
 
       y y y
```

Combining:
```
 x
 
   z z z z
   
       y y y
```

From this visualization, it seems like x can be N, NW, W, or even NE of z, depending on its exact position.

Actually, I think my confusion stems from the definitions of the cardinal directions. Let me re-read them.

a is NW of b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

This means that the rightmost part of a is to the left of the leftmost part of b, AND the topmost part of b is below the bottommost part of a.

a is S of b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

This means that the topmost part of a is below the bottommost part of b, AND the x-extent of a is contained within the x-extent of b.

With these definitions, when y is S of z, y is directly below z, and its x-extent is contained within z's x-extent.

When x is NW of y, x is to the northwest of y, which means it's above and to the left of y.

Combining these, x is to the northwest of y, and y is directly below z. So what's the relation between x and z?

Let's analyze the possible positions of x and z.

The x-position of x is to the left of y.
The x-position of z covers the x-position of y.

This means x could be to the left of z, or it could overlap with z in the x-direction.

The y-position of x is above y.
The y-position of z is above y.

This means x and z are both above y, but they could be in various y-relationships with each other.

Let's go through the relations:

1. NW relation: x is NW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   For this to hold, x must be to the left of z and above z. Given our constraints, x is to the left of y, and z is above y. But this doesn't directly tell us if x is to the left of z. Also, both x and z are above y, but we don't know if x is above z. So, NW is possible.

2. N relation: x is N of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   For this to hold, x must be above z, and its x-extent must be contained within z's x-extent. Given our constraints, both x and z are above y, but we don't know if x is above z. Also, x is to the left of y, but z's x-extent covers y's. This doesn't directly tell us if x's x-extent is contained within z's. So, N is possible.

3. NE relation: x is NE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   For this to hold, x must be to the right of z and above z. Given our constraints, x is to the left of y, and z's x-extent covers y's. It's possible that x is to the right of z, but it would require a specific configuration. Also, both x and z are above y, but we don't know if x is above z. So, NE is possible but might require a specific configuration.

4. W relation: x is W of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   For this to hold, x must be to the left of z, and its y-extent must be contained within z's y-extent. Given our constraints, x is to the left of y, and z's x-extent covers y's. But we don't know if x is to the left of z. Also, both x and z are above y, but we don't know the exact y-relationship. So, W is possible.

5. B relation: x is B of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   For this to hold, x's extent must be contained within z's extent in both x and y directions. Given our constraints, x is to the left of y, and z's x-extent covers y's. It's possible that x's x-extent is contained within z's, but it would require a specific configuration. Also, both x and z are above y, but we don't know the exact y-relationship. So, B is possible but might require a specific configuration.

6. E relation: x is E of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   For this to hold, x must be to the right of z, and its y-extent must be contained within z's y-extent. Given our constraints, x is to the left of y, and z's x-extent covers y's. It's possible that x is to the right of z, but it would require a specific configuration. Also, both x and z are above y, but we don't know the exact y-relationship. So, E is possible but might require a specific configuration.

7. SW relation: x is SW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   For this to hold, x must be to the left of z and below z. Given our constraints, x is to the left of y, and z's x-extent covers y's. But we don't know if x is to the left of z. Also, x is above y, and z is above y. Given that y is S of z, if x is also S of z, then x and y would both be below z. This doesn't contradict the constraint that x is NW of y, since x can still be to the northwest of y even if they're both below z. So, SW is possible.

8. S relation: x is S of z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   For this to hold, x must be below z, and its x-extent must be contained within z's x-extent. Given our constraints, x is above y, and y is below z. This doesn't directly tell us if x is below z or not. So, S is possible.

9. SE relation: x is SE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   For this to hold, x must be to the right of z and below z. Given our constraints, x is to the left of y, and z's x-extent covers y's. It's possible that x is to the right of z, but it would require a specific configuration. Also, x is above y, and z is above y. As discussed in the SW case, it's possible for x to be below z. So, SE is possible but might require a specific configuration.

After going through all the relations, it seems like every direction is possible, depending on the specific configuration of the regions.

Let me double check this.

Actually, let's try a visual approach again. I know this:

```
  Y is S of Z:
        +----------+
        |          |
        |    Z     |
        |          |
        +----------+
             ^
             |
        +----------+
        |          |
        |    Y     |
        |          |
        +----------+

  X is NW of Y:
        +-----+
        |     |
        |  X  |

              \

        |    Y     |
        |          |
        +----------+
```

Combining these, we need to figure out where X is relative to Z. Let's try to place these systematically.

```
  Scenario 1 (X is NW of Z):
        +-----+
        |     |
        |  X  |
        |     |
        +-----+

                  |          |

                  |          |
                  +----------+

So, X can be NW of Z.

  Scenario 2 (X is W of Z):
                  +----------+
                  |          |
        +-----+   |    Z     |

                  |          |
                  +----------+
```

So, X can be W of Z.

```
  Scenario 3 (X is N of Z):
        +-----+
        |     |
        |  X  |
        |     |

        |    Y     |
        |          |
        +----------+
```

So, X can be N of Z.

```
  Scenario 4 (X is NE of Z):
                      +-----+
                      |     |
                      |  X  |

        |    Y     |
        |          |
        +----------+
```

Wait, this doesn't make sense. If X is NE of Z, and Z is N of Y, then X would be to the northeast of Y, not to the northwest.

Ok, I think my issue is visualizing what it means for X to be NW of Y. Let's be more precise.

For X to be NW of Y:
- supx(X) <= infx(Y): The rightmost point of X is to the left of the leftmost point of Y.
- supy(Y) <= infy(X): The topmost point of Y is below the bottommost point of X.

Here's a correct visualization:

```
    +-----+
    |  X  |
    +-----+
            +-----+
            |  Y  |
            +-----+
```

Now, for Y to be S of Z:
- supy(Y) <= infy(Z): The topmost point of Y is below the bottommost point of Z.
- infx(Z) <= infx(Y) and supx(Y) <= supx(Z): The x-extent of Y is contained within the x-extent of Z.

Here's a visual:

```
        +-----+
        |  Z  |
        +-----+
            
        +---+
        | Y |
        +---+
```

Combining these, X is to the northwest of Y, and Y is to the south of Z. Now what can we say about the relation between X and Z?

```
    +-----+
    |  X  |
    +-----+
            +-----+
            |  Z  |
            +-----+
            
            +---+
            | Y |
            +---+
```

In this configuration, X is NW of Z.

But let's see if there are other valid configurations:

```
    +-----+
    |  X  |
    +-----+
        +-------+
        |   Z   |
        +-------+
            
            +---+
            | Y |
            +---+
```

In this configuration, X is N of Z.

```
        +-----+
        |  X  |
        +-----+
    +-------+
    |   Z   |
    +-------+
        
        +---+
        | Y |
        +---+
```

In this configuration, X is NE of Z.

So, X can be NW, N, or NE of Z.

Let's check more configurations. What about W, B, and E?

```
    +-----+
    |  X  |
    +-----+
            +-----+
            |  Z  |
            +-----+
            
            +---+
            | Y |
            +---+
```

In this configuration, X is W of Z.

```
       +----------+
       |    Z     |
    +-----+       |
    |  X  |       |
    +-----+       |
       |          |
       +----------+
            
            +---+
            | Y |
            +---+
```

In this configuration, X is B of Z. But I think this configuration isn't valid. If X is inside Z, then the x-extent of X is inside the x-extent of Z. This means if Y is S of Z and X is NW of Y, then X's rightmost point would be to the left of Y's leftmost point, which might not be inside Z's x-extent. So, I don't think X can be B of Z.

Actually, let me reconsider. For X to be NW of Y, the rightmost point of X needs to be to the left of the leftmost point of Y. For Y to be S of Z, the x-extent of Y needs to be contained within the x-extent of Z. It's still possible for X's x-extent to be contained within Z's x-extent, especially if Z's x-extent is wide. So, X can be B of Z, but it requires a specific configuration.

```
                 +-----+
                 |  X  |
                 +-----+
    +-------+
    |   Z   |
    +-------+
        
        +---+
        | Y |
        +---+
```

In this configuration, X is E of Z.

So, X can be NW, N, NE, W, B, or E of Z.

What about SW, S, and SE?

For X to be SW of Z, it needs to be to the southwest of Z. But it also needs to be to the northwest of Y. Given that Y is S of Z, it's challenging to see how X can be SW of Z and NW of Y simultaneously:

```
    +-----+
    |  Z  |
    +-----+
            
         +---+
         | X |
         +---+
                +---+
                | Y |
                +---+
```

Oh but this still doesn't look right.

Let me rethink the scenario. We have:
1. X is NW of Y
2. Y is S of Z

We can decompose these relationships:

For X is NW of Y:
- X is to the left of Y (in the x-dimension)
- X is above Y (in the y-dimension)

For Y is S of Z:
- Y is below Z (in the y-dimension)
- Y's x-extent is contained within Z's x-extent

From these, we know:
- X is to the left of Y, and Y's x-extent is contained within Z's x-extent. So X can be to the left of Z (W, NW, SW), or X's x-extent can overlap with Z's x-extent.
- X is above Y, and Y is below Z. So X and Z are both above Y, but their relative positions in the y-dimension can vary. X can be above Z, at the same y-level as Z, or below Z.

Combining these, X can be in any of the nine cardinal directions relative to Z, depending on the specific configuration.

Let me try one more approach: working with specific coordinates.
- Let Y be centered at (0, 0) with a width of 2 and a height of 2, so it spans from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
- Let Z be centered at (0, 3) with a width of 4 and a height of 2, so it spans from (-2, 2) to (2, 4).

This ensures that Y is S of Z.

Now, for X to be NW of Y, it needs to be to the left and above Y. So, X's rightmost point is to the left of Y's leftmost point, which is -1, and X's bottommost point is above Y's topmost point, which is 1. So, X's rightmost point is at most -1, and its bottommost point is at least 1.

With these constraints, let's explore different positions for X and see its relation to Z:

- If X is centered at (-4, 3) with a width of 2 and a height of 2, it spans from (-5, 2) to (-3, 4). In this case, X is W of Z.
- If X is centered at (-4, 5) with a width of 2 and a height of 2, it spans from (-5, 4) to (-3, 6). In this case, X is NW of Z.
- If X is centered at (-4, 1) with a width of 2 and a height of 2, it spans from (-5, 0) to (-3, 2). In this case, X is SW of Z.
- If X is centered at (0, 5) with a width of 2 and a height of 2, it spans from (-1, 4) to (1, 6). In this case, X is N of Z.
- If X is centered at (0, 1) with a width of 2 and a height of 2, it spans from (-1, 0) to (1, 2). In this case, X is S of Z.
- If X is centered at (4, 5) with a width of 2 and a height of 2, it spans from (3, 4) to (5, 6). In this case, X is NE of Z.
- If X is centered at (4, 1) with a width of 2 and a height of 2, it spans from (3, 0) to (5, 2). In this case, X is SE of Z.
- If X is centered at (4, 3) with a width of 2 and a height of 2, it spans from (3, 2) to (5, 4). In this case, X is E of Z.
- If X is centered at (0, 3) with a width of 1 and a height of 1, it spans from (-0.5, 2.5) to (0.5, 3.5). In this case, X is B of Z.

So, X can be in all cardinal directions relative to Z.

But wait, I think there's a problem with my examples. For X to be NW of Y, it needs to be to the northwest of Y. But I think I've conflated "to the northwest" with "to the west and to the north". Let me recheck the definition.

For X to be NW of Y, we need:
- supx(X) <= infx(Y): The rightmost point of X is to the left of the leftmost point of Y.
- supy(Y) <= infy(X): The topmost point of Y is below the bottommost point of X.

So that's "to the left and above". OK but in that case it feels like NW is a more strict constraint than N and W. It requires both to be true. So I don't know if my examples made much sense.

OK let's decompose the relationship between X and Z.

For X to be NW of Y, we need:
- supx(X) <= infx(Y): The rightmost point of X is to the left of the leftmost point of Y. (X is to the left of Y)
- supy(Y) <= infy(X): The topmost point of Y is below the bottommost point of X. (X is above Y)

For Y to be S of Z, we need:
- supy(Y) <= infy(Z): The topmost point of Y is below the bottommost point of Z. (Y is below Z)
- infx(Z) <= infx(Y) and supx(Y) <= supx(Z): The x-extent of Y is contained within the x-extent of Z. (Y's x-projection is contained within Z's x-projection)

From these, we can deduce:
- X is to the left of Y, and Y's x-projection is contained within Z's. This means X might be to the left of Z, or it might overlap with Z in the x-direction, or it might be to the right of Z.
- X is above Y, and Y is below Z. This means X and Z are both above Y, but their relative positions in the y-direction can vary.

Now, let's check which of the cardinal directions between X and Z are consistent with these deductions.

1. N: For X to be N of Z, we need:
   - supy(Z) <= infy(X): Z is below X.
   - infx(Z) <= infx(X) and supx(X) <= supx(Z): X's x-projection is contained within Z's.
   X is above Y, and Y is below Z. But this doesn't tell us if X is above Z. Also, X is to the left of Y, but this doesn't tell us if X's x-projection is contained within Z's. So, N is possible.

2. NE: For X to be NE of Z, we need:
   - supx(Z) <= infx(X): Z is to the left of X.
   - supy(Z) <= infy(X): Z is below X.
   Given that X is to the left of Y, and Y's x-projection is contained within Z's, it's challenging to see how X can be to the right of Z. So, I don't believe NE is possible.

Wait, I think I'm making a conceptual error. Let's be precise about the definition of "X is NW of Y". It means that X is in the northwest tile of Y. It doesn't mean that X lies somewhere vaguely to the northwest of Y. So:
- if X is NW of Y, then X is entirely to the west and north of Y. There's no overlap.
- if Y is S of Z, Y is entirely south of Z, with their x-projections overlapping.

OK let me visualize this more clearly:

```
    +-----+
    |  X  |
    +-----+
               +-----+
               |  Y  |
               +-----+
```

Here, X is NW of Y. X is fully to the northwest.

```
        +----------+
        |    Z     |
        +----------+
               
               +-----+
               |  Y  |
               +-----+
```

Here, Y is S of Z. Y is fully to the south.

Combining these, we get:

```
    +-----+
    |  X  |
    +-----+
               +----------+
               |    Z     |
               +----------+
               
               +-----+
               |  Y  |
               +-----+
```

In this scenario, X is NW of Z. But, the x-projection of Z might extend further left, or the y-projection of Z might extend further up, leading to other cardinal directions.

I think the possible relations are: NW, N, W. The other directions are inconsistent with the constraints.

OK I realize the issue is that I'm not considering the boundaries of the regions correctly. Let me be more explicit about the definitions and constraints.

X is NW of Y if and only if:
- supx(X) <= infx(Y): The rightmost point of X is to the left of the leftmost point of Y.
- supy(Y) <= infy(X): The topmost point of Y is below the bottommost point of X.

Y is S of Z if and only if:
- supy(Y) <= infy(Z): The topmost point of Y is below the bottommost point of Z.
- infx(Z) <= infx(Y) and supx(Y) <= supx(Z): The x-extent of Y is contained within the x-extent of Z.

Now, let's carefully determine the possible cardinal directions between X and Z:

1. NW: X is NW of Z if supx(X) <= infx(Z) and supy(Z) <= infy(X).
   From X NW of Y, we have supx(X) <= infx(Y).
   From Y S of Z, we have infx(Z) <= infx(Y).
   Together, we don't directly get supx(X) <= infx(Z). But it's possible.
   From X NW of Y, we have supy(Y) <= infy(X).
   From Y S of Z, we have supy(Y) <= infy(Z).
   Together, we don't directly get supy(Z) <= infy(X). But it's possible.
   So, NW is possible.

2. N: X is N of Z if supy(Z) <= infy(X), infx(Z) <= infx(X) and supx(X) <= supx(Z).
   From X NW of Y, we have supy(Y) <= infy(X).
   From Y S of Z, we have supy(Y) <= infy(Z).
   Together, we don't directly get supy(Z) <= infy(X). But it's possible.
   From X NW of Y, we have supx(X) <= infx(Y).
   From Y S of Z, we have infx(Z) <= infx(Y) and supx(Y) <= supx(Z).
   Together, we don't directly get infx(Z) <= infx(X) or supx(X) <= supx(Z). But it's possible.
   So, N is possible.

3. NE: X is NE of Z if supx(Z) <= infx(X) and supy(Z) <= infy(X).
   From X NW of Y, we have supx(X) <= infx(Y).
   From Y S of Z, we have infx(Z) <= infx(Y) and supx(Y) <= supx(Z).
   Together, we have supx(X) <= infx(Y) and supx(Y) <= supx(Z).
   This doesn't directly give us supx(Z) <= infx(X). In fact, it suggests the opposite. So, NE is not possible.

4. W: X is W of Z if supx(X) <= infx(Z), infy(Z) <= infy(X) and supy(X) <= supy(Z).
   As discussed earlier, supx(X) <= infx(Z) is possible.
   From X NW of Y, we have supy(Y) <= infy(X).
   From Y S of Z, we have supy(Y) <= infy(Z).
   Together, we don't directly get infy(Z) <= infy(X) or supy(X) <= supy(Z). But they're possible.
   So, W is possible.

5. B: X is B of Z if infx(Z) <= infx(X), supx(X) <= supx(Z), infy(Z) <= infy(X) and supy(X) <= supy(Z).
   From X NW of Y, we have supx(X) <= infx(Y).
   From Y S of Z, we have infx(Z) <= infx(Y).
   Together, we have supx(X) <= infx(Y) and infx(Z) <= infx(Y).
   This doesn't directly give us infx(Z) <= infx(X). In fact, it suggests the opposite. So, B is not possible.

6. E: X is E of Z if supx(Z) <= infx(X), infy(Z) <= infy(X) and supy(X) <= supy(Z).
   As discussed in the NE case, supx(Z) <= infx(X) is not possible. So, E is not possible.

7. SW: X is SW of Z if supx(X) <= infx(Z) and supy(X) <= infy(Z).
   As discussed earlier, supx(X) <= infx(Z) is possible.
   From X NW of Y, we have supy(Y) <= infy(X).
   From Y S of Z, we have supy(Y) <= infy(Z).
   Together, we don't directly get supy(X) <= infy(Z). But it's possible.
   So, SW is possible.

8. S: X is S of Z if supy(X) <= infy(Z), infx(Z) <= infx(X) and supx(X) <= supx(Z).
   As discussed in the SW case, supy(X) <= infy(Z) is possible.
   As discussed in the B case, infx(Z) <= infx(X) is likely not possible. So, S is not possible.

9. SE: X is SE of Z if supx(Z) <= infx(X) and supy(X) <= infy(Z).
   As discussed in the NE case, supx(Z) <= infx(X) is not possible. So, SE is not possible.

After this careful analysis, the possible cardinal directions between X and Z are: NW, N, W, and SW.

Actually, my analysis isn't quite right. I need to revisit the definitions and ensure I'm interpreting them correctly.

First, I need to clarify a crucial detail. When I say "A is to the direction D of B", I mean that region A is, as a whole, in the direction D of region B. This means there's no overlap between A and B in the dimensions relevant to direction D.

The definitions for the cardinal directions from the prompt for region a to region b are:

- B: a is B of b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). This means a is contained within b.
- S: a is S of b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). This means a is below b, and its x-extent is contained within b's x-extent.
- SW: a is SW of b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b). This means a is to the southwest of b.
- W: a is W of b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). This means a is to the west of b, and its y-extent is contained within b's y-extent.
- NW: a is NW of b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a). This means a is to the northwest of b.
- N: a is N of b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). This means a is above b, and its x-extent is contained within b's x-extent.
- NE: a is NE of b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a). This means a is to the northeast of b.
- E: a is E of b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). This means a is to the east of b, and its y-extent is contained within b's y-extent.
- SE: a is SE of b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b). This means a is to the southeast of b.

Now, let's reanalyze the constraints and determine the possible cardinal directions between X and Z.

Our constraints are:
- X is NW of Y: supx(X) <= infx(Y) and supy(Y) <= infy(X).
- Y is S of Z: supy(Y) <= infy(Z), infx(Z) <= infx(Y) and supx(Y) <= supx(Z).

For X to be NW of Z, we need: supx(X) <= infx(Z) and supy(Z) <= infy(X).
From X NW of Y, we have supx(X) <= infx(Y).
From Y S of Z, we have infx(Z) <= infx(Y).
Together, supx(X) <= infx(Y) and infx(Z) <= infx(Y). It's not necessarily the case that supx(X) <= infx(Z), so X might not be strictly to the west of Z. However, it's possible.
From X NW of Y, we have supy(Y) <= infy(X).
From Y S of Z, we have supy(Y) <= infy(Z).
Together, supy(Y) <= min(infy(X), infy(Z)). It's not necessarily the case that supy(Z) <= infy(X), so X might not be strictly to the north of Z. However, it's possible.
So, X can be NW of Z, but not necessarily.

For X to be N of Z, we need: supy(Z) <= infy(X), infx(Z) <= infx(X) and supx(X) <= supx(Z).
As discussed, supy(Z) <= infy(X) is possible.
From X NW of Y, we have supx(X) <= infx(Y).
From Y S of Z, we have infx(Z) <= infx(Y) and supx(Y) <= supx(Z).
Together, we don't directly get infx(Z) <= infx(X) or supx(X) <= supx(Z). In fact, since X is strictly to the west of Y, it's likely that infx(X) < infx(Z), which means X might not be strictly to the east of Z. So, X might not be strictly N of Z.

OK so the constraints I'm working with are:

- supx(X) <= infx(Y) (X's right edge is to the left of Y's left edge)
- supy(Y) <= infy(X) (Y's top edge is below X's bottom edge)

- supy(Y) <= infy(Z) (Y's top edge is below Z's bottom edge)
- infx(Z) <= infx(Y) (Z's left edge is to the left of Y's left edge)
- supx(Y) <= supx(Z) (Y's right edge is to the right of Z's right edge)

With these constraints, X is entirely to the left of Y (in the x dimension) and entirely above Y (in the y dimension). And Y is entirely below Z (in the y dimension), with its x-projection contained within Z's x-projection.

Using these constraints, I can determine which of the cardinal directions are possible for X relative to Z:

1. NW: X is NW of Z if supx(X) <= infx(Z) and supy(Z) <= infy(X).
   supx(X) <= infx(Z): From supx(X) <= infx(Y) and infx(Z) <= infx(Y), we don't directly know if supx(X) <= infx(Z).
   supy(Z) <= infy(X): From supy(Y) <= infy(X) and supy(Y) <= infy(Z), we don't directly know if supy(Z) <= infy(X).
   So, NW is possible.

2. N: X is N of Z if supy(Z) <= infy(X), infx(Z) <= infx(X) and supx(X) <= supx(Z).
   supy(Z) <= infy(X): As above, we don't directly know.
   infx(Z) <= infx(X): From supx(X) <= infx(Y) and infx(Z) <= infx(Y), it's likely that infx(X) < infx(Z), which contradicts this condition.
   So, N is not possible.

3. NE: X is NE of Z if supx(Z) <= infx(X) and supy(Z) <= infy(X).
   supx(Z) <= infx(X): From supx(X) <= infx(Y), supx(Y) <= supx(Z), and assuming X is a nonempty region, we have infx(X) <= supx(X) <= infx(Y) <= supx(Y) <= supx(Z). This contradicts supx(Z) <= infx(X).
   So, NE is not possible.

4. W: X is W of Z if supx(X) <= infx(Z), infy(Z) <= infy(X) and supy(X) <= supy(Z).
   supx(X) <= infx(Z): As above, we don't directly know.
   infy(Z) <= infy(X): From supy(Y) <= infy(X) and supy(Y) <= infy(Z), we don't directly know.
   supy(X) <= supy(Z): From supy(Y) <= infy(X), X is above Y, so supy(X) > supy(Y). But we don't directly know if supy(X) <= supy(Z).
   So, W is possible.

5. B: X is B of Z if infx(Z) <= infx(X), supx(X) <= supx(Z), infy(Z) <= infy(X) and supy(X) <= supy(Z).
   infx(Z) <= infx(X): As discussed in N, we likely have infx(X) < infx(Z), which contradicts this condition.
   So, B is not possible.

6. E: X is E of Z if supx(Z) <= infx(X), infy(Z) <= infy(X) and supy(X) <= supy(Z).
   supx(Z) <= infx(X): As discussed in NE, we have supx(Z) >= infx(X), which contradicts this condition.
   So, E is not possible.

7. SW: X is SW of Z if supx(X) <= infx(Z) and supy(X) <= infy(Z).
   supx(X) <= infx(Z): As above, we don't directly know.
   supy(X) <= infy(Z): From supy(Y) <= infy(X) and supy(Y) <= infy(Z), we don't directly know if supy(X) <= infy(Z).
   So, SW is possible.

8. S: X is S of Z if supy(X) <= infy(Z), infx(Z) <= infx(X) and supx(X) <= supx(Z).
   supy(X) <= infy(Z): As above, we don't directly know.
   infx(Z) <= infx(X): As discussed in N, we likely have infx(X) < infx(Z), which contradicts this condition.
   So, S is not possible.

9. SE: X is SE of Z if supx(Z) <= infx(X) and supy(X) <= infy(Z).
   supx(Z) <= infx(X): As discussed in NE, we have supx(Z) >= infx(X), which contradicts this condition.
   So, SE is not possible.

After this refined analysis, the possible cardinal directions between X and Z are: NW, W, and SW.

Actually, hold on. I'm having trouble with my analysis of the N relation. I'm making a logical error. Let me clarify things.

From supx(X) <= infx(Y) (X is to the left of Y) and infx(Z) <= infx(Y) (Z's left edge is to the left of Y's left edge), I concluded that it's likely that infx(X) < infx(Z), which would mean that X's left edge is to the left of Z's left edge. However, this is not a direct consequence of the given constraints. The constraints only tell us about the positions of X and Y, and Z and Y, but not directly about X and Z. So, in reality, X could indeed be N of Z if it's positioned correctly.

Let me reconsider using a more grounded approach.

Given the constraints, X is entirely to the left of Y and entirely above Y. And Y is entirely below Z, with its x-projection contained within Z's x-projection. We need to determine which of the cardinal directions are possible for X relative to Z.

Let me visualize this with concrete examples:

1. Scenario for NW: X is at position (-3, 3) with width and height of 1, Y is at position (0, 0) with width and height of 1, and Z is at position (1, 3) with width and height of 1. In this case, X is NW of Z.

2. Scenario for N: X is at position (1, 5) with width and height of 1, Y is at position (3, 0) with width and height of 1, and Z is at position (1, 3) with width and height of 2. In this case, X is N of Z.

3. Scenario for W: X is at position (-3, 3) with width and height of 1, Y is at position (0, 0) with width and height of 1, and Z is at position (1, 3) with width and height of 4, such that Z extends below X. In this case, X is W of Z.

4. Scenario for SW: X is at position (-3, 3) with width and height of 1, Y is at position (0, 0) with width and height of 1, and Z is at position (1, 5) with width and height of 1. In this case, X is SW of Z.

These examples show that X can be NW, N, W, or SW of Z, depending on the specific positioning.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is S of region z

When x is NW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is entirely to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely above y)

When y is S of z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is entirely below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-extent is contained within z's x-extent)

Let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. NW: x can be northwest of z if both x is to the left of z and above z
2. N: x can be north of z if x is directly above z and within z's x-extent
3. W: x can be west of z if x is to the left of z and its y-extent overlaps with z's y-extent
4. SW: x can be southwest of z if x is to the left of z and below z

The constraints don't allow for the other cardinal directions (NE, E, SE, S, B) because:
- x must be to the left of y (from x NW of y)
- y's x-extent is within z's x-extent (from y S of z)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, N, W, SW.
