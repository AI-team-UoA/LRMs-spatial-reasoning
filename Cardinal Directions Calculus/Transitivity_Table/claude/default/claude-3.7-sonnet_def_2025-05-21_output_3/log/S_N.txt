PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

- We're told that region x is S of region y, which means x S y.
- We're also told that region y is N of region z, which means y N z.

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's use the definitions from the prompt:

x S y if and only if:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

y N z if and only if:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's try to derive constraints for the relation between x and z:

From x S y, we have:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y N z, we have:
4. supy(z) <= infy(y)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these constraints:
- From 2 and 5: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- From 3 and 6: supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- From 1 and 4: supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

We can't directly infer the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z) from the given constraints.

Let's think about this geometrically. If x is S of y and y is N of z, then x is to the south of y, and y is to the north of z. This suggests that x might be to the south of z, but it's also possible that x overlaps with z in the north-south direction.

Let's consider a specific case where the regions are aligned. If y is directly north of z and x is directly south of y, then x would be directly south of z. But there could be other configurations.

For example, if y is far to the east of z (while still being north of z), and x is far to the west of y (while still being south of y), then x could be to the southwest of z.

Let's try to enumerate the possible relations between x and z based on the constraints:

1. S (South): If x's northern boundary is below z's southern boundary and x's eastern and western boundaries are within z's.
2. SW (Southwest): If x's northern boundary is below z's southern boundary and x's eastern boundary is to the west of z's western boundary.
3. SE (Southeast): If x's northern boundary is below z's southern boundary and x's western boundary is to the east of z's eastern boundary.
4. W (West): If x's eastern boundary is to the west of z's western boundary, and x's northern and southern boundaries are within z's.
5. E (East): If x's western boundary is to the east of z's eastern boundary, and x's northern and southern boundaries are within z's.
6. NW (Northwest): Not possible because x is south of y and y is north of z, so x can't be to the north of z.
7. N (North): Not possible for the same reason as NW.
8. NE (Northeast): Not possible for the same reason as NW.
9. B (Bounding Box): If x is contained within z's bounding box. Not sure that's possible with the given constraints.

Let me double-check this:

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our derived constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.
- supx(x) <= supx(z) is satisfied.

But we don't have a direct constraint on supy(x) relative to infy(z). However, we do know that supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). This doesn't give us a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z).

Let me reconsider. Actually, the fact that y is N of z means that supy(z) <= infy(y). And since x is S of y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).

So, indirectly, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). x could be above, below, or at the same level as z in the y-coordinate.

Hmm, I realize I may have missed something. The definition of S says that the south region's top is below the reference region's bottom. So, if x is S of y, and y is N of z, then x is below y, and y is above z.

Let's revisit:

x S y means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)  (x's top is below y's bottom)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)  (x's left is to the right of or at y's left)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x's right is to the left of or at y's right)

y N z means:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)  (z's top is below y's bottom)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)  (y's left is to the right of or at z's left)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y's right is to the left of or at z's right)

I'm trying to decide if this tells us if x is above, below, or at the same height as z. Let's see.

From x S y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
From y N z, we have supy(z) <= infy(y).

So both supy(x) and supy(z) are less than or equal to infy(y). But this doesn't tell us the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z).

But wait, I think I'm considering this wrong. The whole point is that we don't have a definite relationship. We're asked for the "possible" relationships between x and z. So I should be looking at what relationships could exist.

Given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z could be:
1. S: if x is directly south of z, with no east-west displacement.
2. SW: if x is to the southwest of z.
3. SE: if x is to the southeast of z.
4. W: if x is directly west of z, with no north-south displacement.
5. E: if x is directly east of z, with no north-south displacement.
6. B: if x overlaps with z (i.e., x is inside z).

Let me verify each of these.

1. S (South):
For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From the constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which satisfies infx(z) <= infx(x).
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which satisfies supx(x) <= supx(z).

But the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) is not guaranteed. However, it's not contradicted either. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x would be S of z. So S is a possible relation.

2. SW (Southwest):
For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) is not guaranteed but possible, as discussed for the S relation.
For supx(x) <= infx(z), we know that supx(x) <= supx(y) from x S y. But we don't have a direct relationship between supx(y) and infx(z). It's possible, especially if y is quite north and a bit east of z.

Actually, let's think more carefully. For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But, from our derived constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x). This means that for supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, supx(x) <= infx(x). But this can't be true for a non-empty region x (since the supremum of x's x-coordinates must be greater than or equal to the infimum). So, x can't be SW of z.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let's re-derive:

From x S y, we have:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y N z, we have:
4. supy(z) <= infy(y)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these constraints:
- From 2 and 5: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- From 3 and 6: supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But from the constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x). This means:
infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)

This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z), which would require supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). Unless we're dealing with a point or a degenerate region, this would make supx(x) <= infx(x), which is not possible for a regular region. So, it seems that x cannot be SW of z based on the given constraints.

I'm not 100% convinced by that argument though. Let's reconsider the constraints again.

Hmm, wait. I think I need to reconsider the original definitions more carefully. Let's look at them again.

The single-tile cardinal direction relations are defined as follows:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So, using the correct definitions:

x S y means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

y N z means:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Now, let's see if the constraints from x S y and y N z allow for x to be SW of z.

From the constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)

So, infx(z) <= infx(x), which would be consistent with x S z, but not with x SW z. For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), which would imply supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). 

Actually, that's not right. 

It's possible for a region to be to the "southwest" of another region without the former's easternmost boundary being to the west of the latter's westernmost boundary. The definition of "SW" in the context of cardinal directions: a SW b means supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

In other words, for x to be SW of z, the easternmost (or right) boundary of x must be to the west (or left) of the westernmost (or left) boundary of z. And the northernmost (or top) boundary of x must be to the south (or below) the southernmost (or bottom) boundary of z.

Now, let's re-check:

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But from the constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)

So, infx(z) <= infx(x). This doesn't directly tell us about supx(x) in relation to infx(z).

However, for any region a, infx(a) <= supx(a). Thus, infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). This doesn't necessarily contradict supx(x) <= infx(z). But, for both infx(z) <= supx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, we'd have supx(x) = infx(z). This is a very specific case, but it's still theoretically possible.

So, it might be possible for x to be SW of z, but it requires a very specific configuration.

Let me keep going through the other possible relations:

3. SE (Southeast):
For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z), so supx(x) <= supx(z). But this doesn't tell us about the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).

4. W (West):
For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

But from the constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x), which challenges the first condition for the same reason I discussed earlier.

5. E (East):
For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

6. B (Bounding Box):
For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the constraints, we already know:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

But we don't have direct constraints for the y-coordinates.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this. I need to look at it more systematically and with some geometric intuition.

If x is S of y and y is N of z, then let's place them in a 2D space:

```
     y
    / \
   /   \
  x     z
```

If y is directly above both x and z, then x could be S of z (if they're aligned), SE of z (if x is to the right of z), or SW of z (if x is to the left of z).

Given the constraints, I now think the possible relations between x and z are:
1. S
2. SE
3. SW
4. B (if x and z overlap)
5. W (if x is to the far left)
6. E (if x is to the far right)

Let's check each of these more carefully. 

(I'm still concerned that my "SW" and perhaps other reasoning is incorrect. Let me revisit that.)

S (South): I've shown that this relation is consistent with the constraints, as infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z) (if this last condition holds, which it can).

SE (Southeast): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). I haven't been able to derive supx(z) <= infx(x) from the constraints, but it's not contradicted either. So, SE is a possibility.

SW (Southwest): For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But from the constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) unless supx(x) = infx(z). So, SW is a possibility but requires a very specific configuration.

Actually, that's not right. 
From the constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)

So, infx(z) <= infx(x). This means x's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary. But for x to be SW of z, we need x's right boundary to be to the left of z's left boundary. That is, supx(x) <= infx(z). But if infx(z) <= infx(x) and, as is the case for a region, infx(x) <= supx(x), then infx(z) <= supx(x). This directly contradicts the requirement for SW, which is supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

W (West): For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Using the same reasoning as for the SW relation, x cannot be W of z because the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) can't be satisfied given the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).

E (East): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). I haven't been able to derive or contradict these conditions from the constraints. So, E remains a possibility.

B (Bounding Box): For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two conditions are satisfied from the constraints. I haven't been able to derive or contradict the last two conditions. So, B remains a possibility.

For the remaining relations:
- x can't be NW of z because that would require x to be north of z, which contradicts the constraints.
- x can't be N of z for the same reason.
- x can't be NE of z for the same reason.

Summarizing, the possible relations are:
- S
- SE
- E
- B

I think I might have been too particular in thinking that SW was a possibility earlier. Given the constraints, x cannot be to the west of z or to the southwest of z.

Actually, let's double-check that again. The constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) means that x's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary. For x to be to the west of z, the intuition is that x's right boundary should be to the left of z's left boundary. That is, supx(x) <= infx(z). But, given that infx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(x) (which is true for any region), we have infx(z) <= supx(x). This contradicts the requirement for "westness", which is supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be W or SW of z.

But here's where I'm still uncertain: does W (or SW) mean that the entirety of x is to the west of z, or just that some part of x is to the west of z? The definition says:
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

This suggests that W means that the entirety of a is to the west of b. The same logic applies to SW.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let's simplify:

Given the constraints from "x S y" and "y N z":
- infx(z) <= infx(x)  (from the chain of inequalities infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x))
- supx(x) <= supx(z)  (from the chain of inequalities supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z))

For different relations between x and z:
1. S: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first two are satisfied, and the third can be true or false. So, S is a possible relation.
2. SE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the constraint infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x can't be SE of z.
3. SW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). So, x can't be SW of z.
4. W: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). This contradicts the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x). So, x can't be W of z.
5. E: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts the constraint infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x can't be E of z.
6. B: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two are satisfied, and the last two can be true or false. So, B is a possible relation.
7. NW, N, NE: These require x to be north of z, which contradicts the fact that x is south of y and y is north of z. So, these can't be possible relations.

Actually, I think I found the mistake I was making: I misunderstood the direction of the "E" and "SE" relation with regards to the x-coordinate. 

Let's look at the correct definitions again:
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

This means that for x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). For this to be consistent with the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x), we'd need infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). For regions, infx(z) <= supx(z) is always true (since the left boundary is to the left of or at the right boundary). But, requiring supx(z) <= infx(x) is saying that z's right boundary is to the left of x's left boundary. This doesn't contradict the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x); it's just a stronger condition. So, SE is a possible relation.

Actually, wait. Let me take a step back. I think I'm making this too complex.

Given the constraints from "x S y" and "y N z":
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (from the chain of inequalities infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x))
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (from the chain of inequalities supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z))

Let me reapproach each of the 9 relations:

1. S (South): a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
For x S z, we'd need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We already know the last two are satisfied from the constraints. The first condition, supy(x) <= infy(z), isn't directly derivable from the constraints, but it's not contradicted either. It's a condition that can be true or false depending on the specific placement of regions. So, S is a possible relation.

2. SW (Southwest): a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
For x SW z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But from the constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x). For a region, its left boundary is to the left of or at its right boundary, so infx(x) <= supx(x). This gives us infx(z) <= supx(x), which contradicts the requirement for SW, which is supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x can't be SW of z.

3. W (West): a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
Using the same reasoning as for SW, x can't be W of z because the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) can't be satisfied.

4. NW (Northwest): a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
For x NW z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

But, as I've shown, the first condition can't be satisfied. Also, the second condition (which means x is to the north of z) is counter to the intuition that if x is south of y and y is north of z, then x should be south of z. So, x can't be NW of z.

5. N (North): a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
For x N z, we'd need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The last two conditions are satisfied from the constraints. But the first condition (which means x is to the north of z) is counter to the intuition that if x is south of y and y is north of z, then x should be south of z. So, x can't be N of z.

6. NE (Northeast): a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
For x NE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

The second condition is counter to the intuition, as discussed in the N relation. Also, the first condition is a stronger requirement than the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x). It requires z's right boundary to be to the left of x's left boundary, which is more restrictive than z's left boundary being to the left of x's left boundary. While this is not a direct contradiction, it seems unlikely given the general configuration. So, x is unlikely to be NE of z.

7. E (East): a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
For x E z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

As I discussed in the NE relation, the first condition is a stronger requirement than the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x). The other two conditions aren't directly derivable or contradictable from the constraints. So, E is a potential relation, but it seems unlikely.

8. SE (Southeast): a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
For x SE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The first condition, as I've mentioned, is more restrictive than the constraint. The second condition can be true or false. So, while SE is a potential relation, it seems unlikely.

9. B (Bounding Box): a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
For x B z, we'd need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We already know the first two are satisfied from the constraints. The last two aren't directly derivable but can be true. So, B is a possible relation.

After reanalysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (South)
- B (Bounding Box, if x overlaps with z)
- NE (Northeast, but unlikely)
- E (East, but unlikely)
- SE (Southeast, but unlikely)

Ok wait, I'm still making an error regarding SE and E. Let's define a correct configuration.

The constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) says that the x's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary. The constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) says that x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary.

Together, these suggest that the x-extent of x is contained within the x-extent of z (or they share boundaries), at least in the x-dimension. This would make sense for the S or B relations, but not for SE, E, or NE.

For x to be SE of z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z's right boundary is to the left of x's left boundary. This directly contradicts the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x), which means z's left boundary is to the left of or at x's left boundary. For these both to be true, we'd need z's right boundary to be to the left of its left boundary, which is impossible. So, x can't be SE of z.

Similarly, for x to be E of z, one of the conditions is supx(z) <= infx(x), which, as I just explained, contradicts the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x can't be E of z.

And for x to be NE of z, one of the conditions is again supx(z) <= infx(x), which, for the same reason, is not possible. So, x can't be NE of z.

After this clarification, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (South)
- B (Bounding Box, if x overlaps with z)

Actually, I'm thinking of this in the way I imagine the the regions in space, then try to fit the definition. Let me go the other way around and start from the exact definition. Also, one thing I've been messing up is not being rigorous with the variable names.

If x S y, then:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

If y N z, then:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's derive some implications:
1. infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x).
2. supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z).

Let's also think about the y-coordinates:
3. supy(x) <= infy(y) (from "x S y")
4. supy(z) <= infy(y) (from "y N z")

So both supy(x) and supy(z) are bounded above by infy(y). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(x) and supy(z). But, depending on the position, it could be that supy(x) <= supy(z) or supy(z) <= supy(x).

Now, let's imagine a x z for various cardinal direction relationships.
For each of the cardinal directions, I'll describe the constraints, and then I'll check if these are consistent with the implications we derived from "x S y" and "y N z".

1. S (South): x S z means:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The last two conditions are directly satisfied from our derived implications 1 and 2. The first condition isn't derivable from our constraints but is a possibility. So, S is a possible relation.

2. SW (Southwest): x SW z means:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

This contradicts implication 1, which says infx(z) <= infx(x), as I explained: for both supx(x) <= infx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(x), which isn't possible for a region. So, SW is not a possible relation.

3. W (West): x W z means:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Again, the first condition contradicts implication 1. So, W is not a possible relation.

4. NW (Northwest): x NW z means:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

The first condition contradicts implication 1. So, NW is not a possible relation.

5. N (North): x N z means:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The last two conditions are directly satisfied from our derived implications 1 and 2. The first condition isn't directly derivable from our constraints. But it's a possibility. So, N is a possible relation.

6. NE (Northeast): x NE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

This contradicts implication 2, which says supx(x) <= supx(z). For both supx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) to be true, we'd need supx(z) <= supx(z), which is a tautology, but the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) requires supx(z) < infx(x) for a non-empty region. So, NE is not a possible relation, at least not without regions that overlap, which cardinal directions are not supposed to allow.

7. E (East): x E z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

For the same reason as above, the first condition contradicts implication 2. So, E is not a possible relation.

8. SE (Southeast): x SE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

For the same reason as above, the first condition contradicts implication 2. So, SE is not a possible relation.

9. B (Bounding Box): x B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The first two conditions are directly satisfied from our derived implications 1 and 2. The third and fourth conditions are not directly derivable from our constraints. Depending on the position, these might be true. So, B is a possible relation.

After careful re-analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (South)
- N (North)
- B (Bounding Box)

Actually, I'm starting to doubt the N relation too, so let me re-verify.
If x is S of y and y is N of z, then it suggests that y is between x and z in the y-coordinate. That is, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z).
This would make supy(x) <= infy(z), which is the condition for x to be S (or SW or SE) of z, not for x to be N (or NW or NE) of z.

Actually, I realize the mistake I've been making: I've been thinking of the constraints as laying out a specific configuration in space, but they only provide bounds. For instance, the constraint supy(x) <= infy(y) doesn't mean x is directly below y in the y-coordinate, it just means x's top boundary is below or at y's bottom boundary. There could be a gap between the two. 

With that acknowledged, let's rethink:

Given the constraints from "x S y" and "y N z":
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Implying:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

For x N z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). But from the constraints, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). 
Actually, these don't lead to any conclusive relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).

If I logically think about the description, "x is south of y and y is north of z," the most natural conclusion would be that x is south of z. But I'm not trying to reason through the natural tendency of the phrasing and trying to be precise. I'm looking for any set of regions where the constraints are met.

For x N z to be a possibility, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). Is this consistent with the constraints supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)?
It's possible if supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y). So, N is a possibility, but it would require a specific arrangement where z's top boundary is below x's bottom boundary, and x's top boundary is below y's bottom boundary. This is logically possible if the regions are not stacked vertically but have some horizontal displacement.

Ok, I think I'm going to re-examine this one more time: 

Given the constraints from "x S y" and "y N z":
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Implications:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

For reference, the cardinal direction relations:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Let's systematically go through each relation for x z:

1. x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x): This is satisfied from the implications.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): This is satisfied from the implications.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): Not directly derivable. Could be true or false.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): Not directly derivable. Could be true or false.
B (Bounding Box) is a possible relation.

2. x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z): Not directly derivable. Could be true or false.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): This is satisfied from the implications.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): This is satisfied from the implications.
S (South) is a possible relation.

3. x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This contradicts the implication infx(z) <= infx(x), as I've previously explained. For a non-degenerated region.
SW (Southwest) is not a possible relation.

4. x W z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This contradicts the implication infx(z) <= infx(x).
W (West) is not a possible relation.

5. x NW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This contradicts the implication infx(z) <= infx(x).
NW (Northwest) is not a possible relation.

6. x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): Not directly derivable. Could be true or false.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): This is satisfied from the implications.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): This is satisfied from the implications.
N (North) is a possible relation.

7. x NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This contradicts the implication supx(x) <= supx(z), as I've previously explained.
NE (Northeast) is not a possible relation.

8. x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This contradicts the implication supx(x) <= supx(z).
E (East) is not a possible relation.

9. x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This contradicts the implication supx(x) <= supx(z).
SE (Southeast) is not a possible relation.

After careful analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (South): If x's top boundary is below z's bottom boundary, and x's left and right boundaries are within z's left and right boundaries.
- N (North): If z's top boundary is below x's bottom boundary, and z's left and right boundaries are within x's left and right boundaries.
- B (Bounding Box): If x is inside the bounding box of z.

So the possible relations are:
- S (South)
- N (North)
- B (Bounding Box)

Actually, let's look at this in a different way. One more time.

If x S y, then:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x's top boundary is below y's bottom boundary)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of y's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of y's right boundary)

If y N z, then:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z's top boundary is below y's bottom boundary)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)

What about the y-coordinates?
From x S y and y N z, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

This suggests two independent constraints: x is below y, and z is below y. It doesn't directly give us the relationship between x and z in the y-coordinate. But it does tell us that both x and z are below y.

Let's explore the possible spatial configurations:
1. If x is directly below y and z is also directly below y, then x and z could overlap in the y-coordinate. In this case, the relation could be that x is N of z, or z is N of x, or they overlap.
2. If x is to the left and below y, and z is to the right and below y, then x and z might not have a direct N-S relationship. Instead, they are both below y. The relation could be x is to the west of z, or z is to the east of x, or they're not related in a cardinal direction manner.

We can say with confidence from the given constraints:
1. x can't be NW, NE, or E of z because those would contradict the implications we've derived.
2. x can't be SW or W of z for the same reason.
3. x is not strictly SE of z (because that would contradict the fact that supx(z) >= supx(x)).

But, given the right spatial configurations and the fact that both x and z are below y, x could potentially be S, N, or B with respect to z. It all depends on the positioning of the regions in the y-coordinate, which is not fully constrained by the conditions x S y and y N z.

Wait, I think I've been overthinking this. While I would find it unlikely, couldn't R be any of the cardinal directions? A lot of my discussion is about when x and z are in the same vicinity, but z could be miles away from y and x.

Let me re-examine:

The constraint (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) clearly restricts x to being bounded within the region of z horizontally.

For the vertical, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), but no constraint exists between x's position and z's position. Therefore, x could be above z, below z, or at the same height as z, given the right spatial configurations, and as long as both x and z are both below y.

Let's make it simple:
- If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is below z, making x S of z.
- If supy(z) <= infy(x), then z is below x, making x N of z.
- If there's an overlap in the y-coordinate and given our horizontal constraints, x is B with z.

So, after all this analysis, the possible relations are:
- S (South): If x's top boundary is below z's bottom boundary.
- N (North): If z's top boundary is below x's bottom boundary.
- B (Bounding Box): If there's an overlap in both x and y coordinates.

In summary, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- S (South)
- N (North)
- B (Bounding Box)

ANSWER:

Looking at the constraints:
- Region x is S of region y: This means x is south of y, with x's top boundary below y's bottom boundary, and x's left-right extent within y's left-right extent.
- Region y is N of region z: This means y is north of z, with z's top boundary below y's bottom boundary, and y's left-right extent within z's left-right extent.

From these constraints, I can derive:
- For x-coordinates: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- For y-coordinates: Both x and z are below y, but their vertical relationship with each other is not constrained

The possible relations between x and z are:

1. S (South): If x's top boundary is below z's bottom boundary
2. N (North): If z's top boundary is below x's bottom boundary
3. B (Bounding Box): If x and z overlap vertically while x remains within z's horizontal extent

The regions cannot have SW, W, NW, SE, E, or NE relations because these would contradict the horizontal constraints we derived.
