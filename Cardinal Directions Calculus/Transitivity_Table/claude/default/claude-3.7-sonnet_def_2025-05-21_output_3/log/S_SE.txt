PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this situation:
1. Region x is S of region y
2. Region y is SE of region z

Now, let's think step-by-step to determine the possible relations between region x and z.

First, let's recall the definitions of the cardinal directions:

- x S y (x is South of y) if and only if:
  * supy(x) <= infy(y)  (x is below y)
  * infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x's x-projection is contained in y's x-projection)

- y SE z (y is Southeast of z) if and only if:
  * supx(z) <= infx(y)  (y is to the right of z)
  * supy(y) <= infy(z)  (y is below z)

Now, let's analyze what we know about x and z:

From x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)  (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x's x-projection is contained in y's x-projection)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)  (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)  (y is below z)

Now let's try to establish the relation between x and z:

For the vertical relationship:
- From x S y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y SE z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z)
- So, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- This means supy(x) <= infy(z), which indicates x is below z

For the horizontal relationship:
- From x S y, we know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y SE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y)
- So, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- This means supx(z) <= infx(x), which indicates x is to the right of z

So, from what we've established:
- x is below z (vertically)
- x is to the right of z (horizontally)

This combination suggests that x is SE (Southeast) of z.

But let's carefully check if there could be other possibilities:

From x S y and y SE z:
- We've confirmed that supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z).
- We've also confirmed that supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z).

If x is strictly to the right of z and strictly below z, then x is SE of z.

But let's check if there are edge cases:

1. Could x be S of z? For this, we'd need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   But from y SE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y), and from x S y, we know infx(y) <= infx(x). 
   So, supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

2. Could x be SW of z? For this, we'd need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   But from the analysis above, we know supx(z) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

3. Could x be W of z? For this, we'd need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we can't establish)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But from the analysis above, we know x is below z, which means supy(x) <= infy(z), contradicting infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be W of z.

4. Could x be NW of z? For this, we'd need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we can't establish)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   But from the analysis above, we know x is below z, which means supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be NW of z.

5. Could x be N of z? For this, we'd need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   But from the analysis above, we know x is below z, which means supy(x) <= infy(z), which again contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

6. Could x be NE of z? For this, we'd need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   But from the analysis above, we know x is below z, which means supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

7. Could x be E of z? For this, we'd need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But from the analysis above, we know x is below z, which means supy(x) <= infy(z), contradicting infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be E of z.

8. Could x be B of z? For this, we'd need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But from the analysis above, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

9. Could x be just SE of z? For this, we'd need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
   This is consistent with our analysis, so x SE z is a valid relation.

Hmm, actually I'm realizing that region x being entirely S of region y doesn't mean its x-projection is fully contained within y's x-projection. 

Let me re-read the definition:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For x S y, this means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y)

For y SE z, the definition is:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, let's re-analyze what we know about x and z:

From x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now let's try to establish the relation between x and z:

For the vertical relationship:
- From x S y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y SE z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z)
- Transitive property doesn't directly apply for infy(y) and supy(y), so we can't conclusively say the vertical relation between x and z from this.
- But from x S y, we know that x is below y, and from y SE z, we know that y is below z. So, by transitivity, x is below z.
- This means supy(x) <= infy(z), indicating that the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z.

For the horizontal relationship:
- From x S y, we know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y SE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y)
- So, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- This means supx(z) <= infx(x), indicating that the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x.

Wait, but this doesn't fully determine the relation between x and z. Let me reconsider.

I need to determine which relation between x and z is consistent with the given constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x)

These constraints mean x is both below and to the right of z, which corresponds to the SE (Southeast) relation. So, x is SE of z.

But let's try check more systematically by considering each possible cardinal direction relation between x and z.

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

For x to be SW of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
But from the analysis above, supx(z) <= infx(x). Assuming regions z doesn't overlap, infx(z) <= supx(z). This gives infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which means supx(x) cannot be <= infx(z), as it would imply supx(x) < infx(x), which is contradictory. So, x cannot be SW of z.

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which, as shown above, cannot be true)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
Since the horizontal constraint cannot be satisfied, x cannot be W of z.

For x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which, as shown above, cannot be true)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
Since the horizontal constraint cannot be satisfied, x cannot be NW of z.

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
But we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). Also, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

For x to be NE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
But we've also established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
We've also established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be E of z.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
This is consistent with our analysis, so x SE z is a valid relation.

For x to be B (inside the bounding box) of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
From the constraints we've established, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies infx(x) >= supx(z). Assuming region z doesn't overlap, infx(z) <= supx(z). This gives infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

Actually, on second thought, I want to re-analyze the vertical relationship:

From x S y, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)

From y SE z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

We need to establish the vertical relationship between x and z, specifically comparing supy(x) and infy(z).

Given that supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), can we say anything about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z)?

Since supy(x) is less than or equal to infy(y), and infy(y) is less than or equal to supy(y) (as the lower bound of a region is at or below its upper bound), we know:

supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

So, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z, or in other words, x is below z.

For the horizontal relationship:

From x S y, we know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y)

From y SE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)

Combining these:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x)

This means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x, or in other words, x is to the right of z.

So, x is both below and to the right of z, which corresponds to the SE relation.

Let's now check which of the other possible relations might be valid:

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of z)

We know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) because it would imply supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction since the right edge of a region cannot be to the left of its left edge. So, x cannot be S of z.

For x to be SW of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

But we've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z, not to the left. So, x cannot be SW of z.

Similarly for the relations W, NW, N, NE, and E, there are contradictions with the established constraints for x and z.

For x to be B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or at the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or at the top edge of z)

Given that supx(z) <= infx(x), it contradicts the conjunction of infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

The only consistent relation is x SE z.

Actually, I'm not sure if I've fully analyzed all possible cases. Let me try to approach this problem differently.

We know:
1. Region x is S of region y.
2. Region y is SE of region z.

Let's visualize the scenario given the constraints.

From "x S y", we know:
- x is directly south of y (i.e., x is below y, but horizontally, x's projection is contained within y's projection).

From "y SE z", we know:
- y is to the southeast of z (i.e., y is below and to the right of z).

Visual representation:

```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+
            +---+
            | y |
            +---+
       +---+
       | x |
       +---+
```

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my interpretation. 

Let's reread the definitions:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For "x S y", this means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left edge of y is to the left of or at the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y)

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

For "y SE z", this means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Ah, I see my mistake. The "x S y" condition doesn't mean x is directly below y. It means x is below y, and horizontally, x is contained within y's projection (or x's projection is not wider than y's projection).

Let's visualize this more accurately:

```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+
            +-----+
            |  y  |
            +-----+
             +---+
             | x |
             +---+
```

Actually, I'm still unsure. Another way to intepret it could be:

```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+
            +-----+
            |  y  |
            +-----+
        +---+
        | x |
        +---+
```

Let's go back to the precise definitions and work out the constraints:

From "x S y":
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left edge of y is to the left of or at the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y)

The second and third conditions together mean that x is contained within y's projection along the x-axis or, more precisely, x's x-projection is not wider than y's x-projection and is either fully contained in or has some overlap with y's x-projection.

From "y SE z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, for the relation between x and z, we need to determine:
1. The vertical relationship (supy(x) vs. infy(z))
2. The horizontal relationship (supx(z) vs. infx(x))

For the vertical relationship:
- From x S y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y SE z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z)
- It's not immediately clear from these constraints what the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) is. The constraints don't form a chain that establishes a relation between them.

Hmm, wait, let me try to think about this differently.

From x S y, we know:
- x is below y (supy(x) <= infy(y))
- x's width is not greater than y's width
- x's horizontal position is contained within y's horizontal position (infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))

From y SE z, we know:
- y is below z (supy(y) <= infy(z))
- y is to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(y))

Combining these, we can say:
- In terms of vertical position, x is below y, and y is below z, so x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z)).
- In terms of horizontal position, y is to the right of z and x's horizontal position is contained within y's, but this doesn't completely determine x's horizontal position relative to z.

Actually, I'm mistaken again. The y S z relation is the one where the "contained within" comes into play, not S E. Let me re-check the definitions:

a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is below b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a) (the left edge of b is to the left of or at the left edge of a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b) (the right edge of a is to the left of or at the right edge of b)

a SE b if and only if:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the right of b)
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is below b)

For "x S y", this means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left edge of y is to the left of or at the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y)

For "y SE z", this means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

With these clear definitions, let's determine the relationship between x and z:

For the vertical relationship:
- From x S y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- From y SE z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- Since the constraints don't form a direct inequality chain, I can't determine the exact vertical relationship. Though by transitivity, since x is below y and y is below z, it's likely x is below z. 
- Actually, we know infy(y) <= supy(y) (for any region, its lower bound is at or below its upper bound). So, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which gives us supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x is below z.

For the horizontal relationship:
- From x S y, we know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y SE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y)
- Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies that x is to the right of z.

So, x is below and to the right of z, which is the definition of the SE (Southeast) relation. Therefore, x is SE of z.

But I want to double-check if any other cardinal direction relation between x and z is possible. Let's see.

Let's consider the cardinal direction relations one by one:

1. x N z:
   - For this, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - But we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z, not above. So, x cannot be N of z.

2. x NE z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - While we've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), we've also shown that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

3. x E z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), but we've also shown that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be E of z.

4. x SE z:
   - For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've established both of these conditions, so x can be SE of z.

5. x S z:
   - For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), but we've also shown that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the conjunction of infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

6. x SW z:
   - For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), but we've also shown that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. x W z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've shown that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

8. x NW z:
   - For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've shown that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be NW of z.

9. x B z:
   - For this, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've shown that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the conjunction of infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

So, the only consistent cardinal direction relation between x and z is SE.

But I'm not sure if what I'm missing anything.

Let me revisit the connection between x S y and y S E. The challenge here is that neither of these relations completely determine the positions of the regions in the plane.

For instance, consider the case where z is at the origin, and y is to the southeast of z, which means y is both to the right and below z. Let's place y at coordinates such that its top-left corner is at (1, -1), and it extends a bit to the right and down.

Now, if x is to the south of y, it means x is below y and its horizontal span is contained within y's horizontal span. But that could place x in many different positions as long as it's below y and its horizontal span is within y's.

This makes me reconsider if the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Let's think about the constraints once more:

From x S y, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left edge of y is to the left of or at the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y)

From y SE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can say:
- x is below y, and y is below z, so x is below z. That is, supy(x) <= infy(z).
- y is to the right of z, and x's left edge is to the right of y's left edge, so x's left edge is to the right of z's right edge. That is, supx(z) <= infx(x).

Since x is both below and to the right of z, by definition, x is to the southeast of z. So, x SE z is a valid relation.

But let's also consider other possible positions of x in relation to z:

For x S z:
- We'd need supy(x) <= infy(z), which is true.
- But we'd also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means x's horizontal span should be contained within z's horizontal span.

From the given constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means z's right edge is to the left of x's left edge. But for x S z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), which is obviously inconsistent if z's right edge is to the left of x's left edge.

So x S z is not a valid relation.

For x E z:
- We'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), which is true.
- But we'd also need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This means x's vertical span should be contained within z's vertical span.

From the given constraints, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means x's top edge is below z's bottom edge. But for x E z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which is obviously inconsistent if x's top edge is below z's bottom edge.

So x E z is not a valid relation.

The only remaining cardinal direction to check is x SE z, which we've already confirmed is a valid relation.

But wait, let me just double-check if there are any assumptions I've been making.

Hmm, so to be careful, let me recall the definition of a single-tile cardinal direction relation:

- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Wait, I think my definitions of the relations might be backwards. For example, "a S b" means "a is South of b", not "b is South of a". Let me double-check my reasoning.

From the problem:
- x is S of y.
- y is SE of z.

For x S y, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of y's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of y's right boundary)

For y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left boundary is to the right of z's right boundary)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y's top boundary is below z's bottom boundary)

From these:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), so by transitivity, supy(x) <= infy(z). Which means x is below z.
- Since supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), we get supx(z) <= infx(x). Which means x is to the right of z.

Based on the definitions, the relation x SE z seems to be the only valid relation between x and z.

Wait, but am I rushing and missing something?

The precise conditions for x S y are:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at the same position as y's left boundary)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at the same position as y's right boundary)

Conditions 2 and 3 together ensure that x's horizontal span is contained within or equal to y's horizontal span.

The precise conditions for y SE z are:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From these:
- Vertical: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x is below z.
- Horizontal: supx(z) <= infx(y). Also, infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y). This means supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is to the left of x, or in other words, x is to the right of z.

So, x is below and to the right of z, which by definition makes x SE of z.

Let's check the other possible relations between x and z to make sure we haven't missed anything:

1. x N z: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x). But we've shown that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z, which is the opposite of x being north of z. So, x N z is not a valid relation.

2. x NE z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). While the first condition is true, the second one contradicts what we've shown, so x NE z is not a valid relation.

3. x E z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is true, but the second one contradicts what we've shown, so x E z is not a valid relation.

4. x SE z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both conditions are true, so x SE z is a valid relation.

5. x S z: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The first condition is true. For the second, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), and from the properties of regions, supx(z) >= infx(z), so it's possible that infx(z) <= infx(x). However, for the third condition, we need to determine if supx(x) <= supx(z). From x S y, we know supx(x) <= supx(y), and from y SE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y). Since the right edge of a region is to the right of or at the same position as its left edge, we know infx(y) <= supx(y). So, we have:

supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

But this doesn't establishes the direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). We need to check if supx(x) <= supx(z) is compatible with the given constraints.

From all the above, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)

If we assume supx(x) <= supx(z) (for x S z to be valid), then we have:

supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction for a non-degenerate region. So, x S z is not a valid relation.

Actually, let's simplify this: We know supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z). For any region, such as region y, we know infx(y) <= supx(y) by definition.

So, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y).

From x S y, we know supx(x) <= supx(y). But from the above chain, it's possible that supx(z) <= supx(x), which means the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for x S z might not be satisfied.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x) (z is to the left of x). This already contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary) for x S z. So, x S z is not a valid relation.

6. x SW z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition is true, but for the first one, we've shown that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is to the left of x, not the other way around. So, x SW z is not a valid relation.

7. x W z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). From the reasoning in point 6, x W z is not a valid relation.

8. x NW z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these contradict what we've shown, so x NW z is not a valid relation.

9. x B z: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). From the reasoning in point 5, x B z is not a valid relation due to the contradiction with supx(z) <= infx(x).

So, after reviewing all possible relations, the only valid relation between x and z is x SE z.

Actually, wait. I want to make sure I'm interpreting the constraints correctly.

From x S y, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at the same position as y's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at the same position as y's right boundary)

I'm not sure if I'm interpreting the last two constraints correctly. If infx(y) <= infx(x), how can we say "x's left boundary is to the right of or at the same position as y's left boundary"? Is the inequality in the wrong direction? 

Oh, I think I got this backwards yet. Let me try to think clear again. 

That's what the definition says, and actually by drawing it, the constraint infx(y) <= infx(x) indeed means "x's left boundary is to the right of or at the same position as y's left boundary".
And similarly, the constraint supx(x) <= supx(y) does mean "x's right boundary is to the left of or at the same position as y's right boundary".
You can see how these two constraints together essentially say "x's x-span is contained within or equal to y's x-span". So OK, I was intepreting those constraints correctly.

But the definition of y being SE of z needs to be re-checked.

For y SE z:

- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left boundary is to the right of z's right boundary, so y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y's top boundary is below z's bottom boundary, so y is below z)

This is also consistent with the definition. So, my original analysis was correct.

In summary, the only valid relation between x and z is x SE z.

Acutally, wait let's double-check everything.

From x S y, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at the same position as y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at the same position as y's right edge)

From y SE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

For the vertical relationship between x and z:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), so by transitivity, supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x is below z.

For the horizontal relationship between x and z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (y's left edge is to the left of x's left edge)
- So, supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is to the left of x.

Based on these, x is below and to the right of z, which corresponds to the "x SE z" relation.

But actually, wait, I haven't properly checked how the condition "supx(x) <= supx(y)" interacts with the constraint from "y SE z". Maybe I shouldn't be too hasty in concluding that x SE z is the only valid relation.

Let's see. From the constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)

If we try to establish a relationship between supx(x) and supx(z) (which would be needed for some of the other cardinal direction relations):

- We know supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- We know supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)

But without any direct constraint relating supx(y) to infx(y), we can't make a conclusion about the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

Oh wait, but by the property of a region, infx(y) <= supx(y). So, we have:

supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y)

And from x S y, we know supx(x) <= supx(y). So, we still don't have a direct comparison between supx(x) and supx(z).

Ok, let's revisit the definition of the cardinal directions and check which one is satisfied.

For x to be SE of z, the following conditions must be met:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

From the constraints we've derived, both of these are satisfied, so x SE z is a valid relation.

For x to be S of z, the following conditions must be met:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z), which is satisfied.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at the same position as z's left edge), which might or might not be satisfied based on the constraints.
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of or at the same position as z's right edge), which might or might not be satisfied based on the constraints.

For x to be S of z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z), which is satisfied.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). For any region z, we know infx(z) <= supx(z) (the left bound of a region is to the left of or at the same position as its right bound).

So, we have: infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x)

For the second condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), to be true, we would need:

supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x)

But this would mean supx(x) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction for a non-degenerate region. So, x S z is not a valid relation.

(In other words, we've established that z is to the left of x, which means x cannot be directly south of z.)

Using similar reasoning, we can check that x SW z, x W z, x NW z, x N z, x NE z, and x E z are not valid relations based on the established constraints.

For x B z, the following conditions must be met:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at the same position as z's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of or at the same position as z's right edge)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's bottom edge is above or at the same position as z's bottom edge)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top edge is below or at the same position as z's top edge)

As shown above, the first two conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously given the constraints. So, x B z is not a valid relation.

In summary, the only valid relation between x and z is x SE z.

Wait, I think there's a tiny chance that I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me revisit the definitions one more time:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For "x S y", this means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left edge of y is to the left of or at the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the right edge of y)

The last two conditions together mean that x's horizontal span is contained within or equal to y's horizontal span.

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

For "y SE z", this means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

We're asked to determine which of the nine cardinal direction relations can describe the relation between x and z:

1. x N z? For this, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the transitivity of the vertical constraints we've derived, so x N z is not a valid relation.

2. x NE z? For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). While the first condition is met, the second contradicates the transitivity of the vertical constraints, so x NE z is not a valid relation.

3. x E z? For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is met, but the second contradicts the transitivity of the vertical constraints, so x E z is not a valid relation.

4. x SE z? For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both of these are satisfied based on the transitivity of the given constraints, so x SE z is a valid relation.

5. x S z? For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The first and possibly the second conditions are met, but the third contradicts the transitivity of the horizontal constraints, so x S z is not a valid relation.

6. x SW z? For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition is met, but the first contradicts the transitivity of the horizontal constraints, so x SW z is not a valid relation.

7. x W z? For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first and third conditions contradict the transitivity of the horizontal and vertical constraints respectively, so x W z is not a valid relation.

8. x NW z? For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these contradict the transitivity of the horizontal and vertical constraints respectively, so x NW z is not a valid relation.

9. x B z? For this, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The second and third conditions contradict the transitivity of the horizontal and vertical constraints, so x B z is not a valid relation.

Based on this meticulous analysis, the only valid relation between x and z is x SE z.

Hmm actually I think we still haven't ruled out all the options.

Let's look at the definition of the cardinal direction relations again:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

From the problem, we know:
- x S y
- y SE z

For the vertical relationship between x and z:
- From x S y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y SE z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z)
- By the property of a region, infy(y) <= supy(y)
- These combine to give supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x is below z.

For the horizontal relationship between x and z:
- From y SE z, we know supx(z) <= infx(y)
- From x S y, we know infx(y) <= infx(x)
- These combine to give supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x is to the right of z.

Together, these tell us that x is southeast of z, so x SE z is a valid relation.

The fact that x SE z (i.e., to the right of AND below z) have been established. So, I ruled out all relations that have x to the left of, above, or directly to the side of z. 

So the only possible answer is x SE z!

Actually, hold on. I want to double-check the statement "We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x). For any region z, we know infx(z) <= supx(z) (the left bound of a region is to the left of or at the same position as its right bound)." This is absolutely correct.

But there's something I've been missing. 

Let's re-check the constraints from x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at the same position as y's left boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at the same position as y's right boundary)

And from y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left boundary is to the right of z's right boundary, so y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y's top boundary is below z's bottom boundary, so y is below z)

OK, so x's horizontal extent must be fully contained within y's horizontal extent for x S y to be true. And y is entirely to the right of z for y SE z to be true. 

We already know (with absolute confidence) that the vertical constraint means x is below z.

For the horizontal relationship:
- From y SE z, we know y is entirely to the right of z. 
- From x S y, we know x's horizontal extent is contained within or equal to y's horizontal extent.
- So, x's horizontal extent is entirely to the right of z.

This means x is to the right of and below z, which is the definition of x SE z.

So, the only valid relation between x and z is x SE z.

Therefore, the answer is SE.

ANSWER:

The question asks about the possible relations between region x and region z, given that:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

I'll analyze the constraints from these two given relations:

From "x S y":
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as y's right edge)

From "y SE z":
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

For the vertical relationship between x and z:
- From the constraints: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z

For the horizontal relationship between x and z:
- From the constraints: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- Therefore, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the right of z

Since x is both below and to the right of z, the only possible relation is:

SE
