PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

1) We know that region x is SE of region y. Using the definition of SE:
   x SE y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
   
   This means:
   - x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - x is to the south of y: supy(x) <= infy(y)

2) We know that region y is S of region z. Using the definition of S:
   y S z if and only if supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
   
   This means:
   - y is to the south of z: supy(y) <= infy(z)
   - y is within the x-bounds of z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

3) Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

First, let's look at the north-south (y-axis) relation:
- From (1): supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From (2): supy(y) <= infy(z)
- By transitivity: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- So, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

Next, let's look at the east-west (x-axis) relation:
- From (1): supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From (2): infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- By combining these, we get: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- So, infx(z) <= infx(x), which means x could be to the east of z (if infx(x) > supx(z)) or x could be overlapping with z in the x-axis (if infx(x) <= supx(z)).

Since we've established that x is to the south of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), and considering the possible positions of x relative to z in the x-axis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z))
- SE (if supx(z) <= infx(x))
- SW (if supx(x) <= infx(z))

Wait, I need to reconsider SW. For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But we've established that infx(z) <= infx(x). This leads to supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction (since infx(x) <= supx(x) for any region). So, SW cannot be a possible relation between x and z.

However, I'm not fully satisfied with this reasoning. Let me reconsider by tracing through the conditions more carefully.

From x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-bounds of z)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:

For the y-axis (north-south relation):
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z)
- We can't derive a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z) from these conditions unless we know more about the values.

Wait, this isn't correct. Let me rethink. Ah, I wasn't accurate enough. Let me be very precise.

From x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-bounds of z)

For the y-axis (north-south relation):
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z)
- Using transitivity, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

For the x-axis (east-west relation):
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- We can combine the first condition from x SE y and the second condition from y S z to get: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- This doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in the x-direction.

Actually, let's consider the possible positions of y relative to z. From y S z, we know that y is to the south of z and y is within the x-bounds of z. Given that y is to the south of z and x is to the south-east of y, x must be to the south-east of z or to the south of z.

This is not rigorous enough. Let me analyze it one more time, case by case.

From x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-bounds of z)

We've already established that x is to the south of z.

Now, for the east-west relation, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

So, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x could start after z starts in the x-direction)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y ends before x starts, and y ends before z ends)

From these, we can determine the possible east-west relations:
- If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is within the x-bounds of z.
- If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= supx(x), then x starts after z starts but extends beyond z's end.
- If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the east of z.

No, this isn't quite right either. Let me be more careful.

From x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-bounds of z)

For the north-south relation:
- From x SE y and y S z, using transitivity: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

For the east-west relation:
- We have: supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- We also have: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)
- From the first: x starts after y ends in the x-direction.
- From the second: y starts after z starts and y ends before z ends.
- Combining these, we know that x starts after y ends in the x-direction, and y starts after z starts and ends before z ends.

Hmm, it's still not giving us a direct relation between x and z in the x-direction. Let me approach this differently.

Let's diagram the situation using intervals. For each region, we can represent its x-projection as an interval [infx, supx] and its y-projection as [infy, supy].

For x SE y:
- x-axis: supx(y) <= infx(x), so the x-interval of x is to the right of the x-interval of y.
- y-axis: supy(x) <= infy(y), so the y-interval of x is below the y-interval of y.

For y S z:
- x-axis: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), so the x-interval of y is contained in the x-interval of z.
- y-axis: supy(y) <= infy(z), so the y-interval of y is below the y-interval of z.

Let's try to determine the relation between x and z.

For the y-axis, we've already established that x is to the south of z.

For the x-axis, let's consider different possibilities:
1. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the east of z. Combined with the south relation, x is SE of z.
2. If infx(x) < supx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x), then x overlaps with z in the x-direction or is contained in z's x-projection. Combined with the south relation, x is S of z.
3. If infx(x) <= infx(z), then x starts before z in the x-direction.

Hmm, for case 3, we need to check if x can extend beyond z in the x-direction (i.e., supx(x) > supx(z)). From the conditions, we know that supx(y) <= supx(z), but we don't have a direct relation between supx(x) and supx(z).

Actually, I am overthinking this. Let me revisit the definitions and be very precise.

For x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-bounds of z)

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've already shown)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We can check if infx(z) <= infx(x):
- From y S z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y).
- From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
- Generally, infx(y) <= supx(y) for any region.
- So, combining these: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
- Yes, infx(z) <= infx(x).

But we can't establish if supx(x) <= supx(z) because we don't have any constraints on supx(x) relative to y or z.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've already shown)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

We can check if supx(z) <= infx(x):
- From y S z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z).
- From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
- This means supx(y) is less than or equal to both supx(z) and infx(x).
- But we can't establish if supx(z) <= infx(x) from these constraints.

Let's think about this geometrically again.

We know that:
- x is to the southeast of y.
- y is to the south of z.

Intuitively, if y is directly below z and x is to the southeast of y, then x must be to the south or southeast of z. But let's make sure.

For x SE y:
- x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x).
- x is to the south of y: supy(x) <= infy(y).

For y S z:
- y is to the south of z: supy(y) <= infy(z).
- y is within the x-bounds of z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Now, to determine the relation between x and z.

For the y-direction:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y).
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z).
- By transitivity, supy(x) <= infy(z).
- This means x is to the south of z.

For the x-direction:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y).
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z).

Let's draw out the possible scenarios.

From y S z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

From x SE y, we have:
infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)

Combining these:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)

Now, we need to determine where supx(x) falls in relation to supx(z). There are a few possibilities:

1. If supx(x) <= supx(z), then:
   infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   This means x is within the x-bounds of z, and combined with the fact that x is to the south of z, the relation would be S.

2. If supx(z) <= supx(x), then:
   infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) <= supx(x)
   This doesn't fit a single-tile cardinal direction. However, if infx(x) >= supx(z), then:
   infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)
   This means x is to the east of z, and combined with the fact that x is to the south of z, the relation would be SE.

Let's reconsider. From the constraints, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x)

If we arrange these:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
Also, supx(y) <= supx(z)

From this, we can say infx(z) <= infx(x).

Now, we don't have direct constraints to determine the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). So, the possible cases are:

1. If supx(x) <= supx(z), then:
   infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   This places x within the x-bounds of z. Combined with the south relation, x is S of z.

2. If supx(z) <= supx(x), we need to determine if infx(x) <= supx(z) or supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - If infx(x) <= supx(z), then:
     infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) <= supx(x)
     This means x overlaps with z in the x-direction. Combined with the south relation, this doesn't fit a single-tile cardinal direction (it would be a mix of S and SE).
   - If supx(z) <= infx(x), then:
     infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)
     This means x is to the east of z. Combined with the south relation, x is SE of z.

Ah, I see, I was being too restrictive. Recall that we are asked for "possible" relations, not the "definite" relation. From the constraints, we can derive that x is to the south of z, and in the x-direction, x either falls within z's x-bounds, is to the east of z, or overlaps with z.

Hold on, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. I'll draw the x-axis constraints.

From y S z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means y's x-interval is contained within z's x-interval.

From x SE y, we have:
infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)

This means x's x-interval is to the right of y's x-interval.

Combining these, we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)

This means x's x-interval starts to the right of where y's x-interval ends. Also, y's x-interval is contained within z's x-interval.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z in the x-direction are:
1. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the east of z.
2. If infx(x) <= supx(z), then x's x-interval either overlaps with z's x-interval, is contained within z's x-interval, or extends beyond z's x-interval.

Given that we've established x is to the south of z, the possible cardinal direction relations are:
1. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is SE of z.
2. If infx(x) <= supx(z) (and by our earlier derivation, infx(z) <= infx(x)), then the relation could be more complex. Specifically:
   - If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is S of z.
   - Otherwise, the relation doesn't fit a single-tile cardinal direction.

Wait, I just realized I can further refine this. Let's look closely at the second case. From our derivation:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)

We know infx(z) <= infx(x), so for x to be S of z, we also need supx(x) <= supx(z).

Now, let's focus. Do we have any constraints on supx(x) relative to supx(z)? We know:
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z).
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y).
- Generally, infx(x) <= supx(x) for any region.

combining these, we get:
supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Unfortunately, we can't establish a direct relation between supx(x) and supx(z).

For the problem where region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (from transitivity of supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)).
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (from transitivity of infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)).

The only constraint we cannot determine is the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z), which means both of the following are possible:
- supx(x) <= supx(z), which combined with the above, implies x is S of z.
- supx(z) <= supx(x), which doesn't fit a single-tile cardinal direction.

Again, refining, if supx(z) <= supx(x), we have the additional case to check: if supx(z) <= infx(x), then x would be to the east of z, making the relation SE.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S and SE.

Actually, wait, let's try to be more careful. We have these constraints:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

Let's just try to check if SE is possible. For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

Is this possible given our constraints? From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). And from y S z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z). So, for SE to be possible, we need supx(z) <= infx(x).

Given that supx(y) is less than or equal to both infx(x) and supx(z), we can't directly determine if supx(z) <= infx(x). This means that both S and SE are possible relations.

To be super clear:
- S is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- SE is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x).

Are there any other possible relations?

Let's consider SW. For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z) from transitivity, but for supx(x) <= infx(z), we already have infx(z) <= infx(x) (which implies infx(z) <= supx(x)). So, for supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, we'd need infx(z) = supx(x). But this means x's x-interval is just a single point at the beginning of z's x-interval, which is a special case and I don't think it satisfies the requirements for regions in REG.

So, both S and SE are possible relations.

Actually, wait, there's the third possible relation: a multi-tile cardinal direction relation that's a combination of S and SE.

Let's see if W is possible. For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z), we get supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z, not to the west.

So, W is not a possible relation.

For SW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z). But for supx(x) <= infx(z), we already have infx(z) <= infx(x) which implies infx(z) <= supx(x) for any REG region. So, for supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, we'd need infx(z) = supx(x). But this seems like an extreme special case, so SW is generally not possible.

For B, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)

From supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z), we get supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z. For x to be B of z, we'd need infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) for REG regions.

So, B is not a possible relation.

For E, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

As with B, the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for REG regions.

So, E is not a possible relation.

For NE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z), we get supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z. For x to be NE of z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) for REG regions.

So, NE is not a possible relation.

For N, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

As with NE, the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for REG regions.

So, N is not a possible relation.

For NW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

As with N and NE, the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for REG regions.

So, NW is not a possible relation.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are S and SE.

Hmm, but I'm still doubting this conclusion. Let me double-check the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) that I've been using heavily.

For y S z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x SE y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x)

Combining these, we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

So, indeed infx(z) <= infx(x).

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've already shown that supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x). The question becomes: is it possible for supx(x) <= supx(z)?

Given the constraints, both supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x) are possible, as there are no constraints on supx(x) relative to supx(z).

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

We've already shown that supy(x) <= infy(z). Is it possible to have supx(z) <= infx(x)?

From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). From y S z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z). So, for SE to be possible, we need supx(z) <= infx(x).

Given the constraints, both supx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(z) are possible, as there are no constraints on supx(z) relative to infx(x) beyond the fact that both are greater than or equal to supx(y).

I think this confirms that both S and SE are possible relations for this problem.

Actually, I think there are additional possibilities. Since infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) can be greater than supx(z), which would correspond to a multi-tile direction. But let's see if there are other single-tile possibilities.

For E, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've seen that supx(z) could be less than or equal to infx(x), satisfying the first condition. But from supy(x) <= infy(z), we know x is strictly below z, which contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for E.

So, E is not possible.

From my analysis, I believe S and SE are the only possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Actually, hold on. I'm starting to doubt the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x). Let me rederive this.

From y S z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From x SE y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x)

From the constraints, I can't assert infx(z) <= infx(x) directly. The only thing I can definitely say is that supx(y) is less than or equal to both infx(x) and supx(z).

However, if I consider infx(z) and infx(x), I can still use the constraints to derive a relationship.

From y S z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).
From x SE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).

For regions in REG, we know infx(y) <= supx(y).

Combining these, we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

So, we do have infx(z) <= infx(x).

Actually, wait. Have I been conflating these relations?

S: y is directly south of z. In terms of intervals, the x-interval of y is contained in the x-interval of z, and the y-interval of y is below the y-interval of z.

SE: y is to the southeast of z. In terms of intervals, the x-interval of y is to the right of the x-interval of z, and the y-interval of y is below the y-interval of z.

Let me be precise one more time.

Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, the question is: which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

From x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the x-bounds of z)

For the north-south relation between x and z, from x SE y and y S z, using transitivity, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

For the east-west relation between x and z, from x SE y and y S z, we know:
supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

Combining these, we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

So, infx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is either to the east of z or overlaps with z in the x-direction.

Now, to determine the exact relation between x and z, we need to classify the relation based on the cardinal directions.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've shown is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've shown that infx(z) <= infx(x). Now, the additional constraint is supx(x) <= supx(z).

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've shown is true)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

From our constraints, we couldn't determine a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x), so this is a possibility. But note that if supx(z) <= infx(x), then x would be to the east of z, and the relation would be SE.

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Since we've shown that supy(x) <= infy(z), the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts this for REG regions.

So, E is not a possible relation.

Similarly, for the other cardinal directions (N, NE, NW, W, SW, B), we can use the fact that supy(x) <= infy(z) to rule out any direction that would require x to be above, at the same level, or partially at the same level as z. This eliminates N, NE, NW, E, W, and B.

For SW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

Given that we already have infx(z) <= infx(x), the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) would imply supx(x) = infx(z). This is a special case (a tangent point), which isn't a typical scenario. 

Actually, let me reconsider this. I think the way I've reasoned about SW isn't correct.

For SW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

We've already shown that supy(x) <= infy(z). For the condition supx(x) <= infx(z), let's see if this can be derived from our constraints.

From y S z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y). From x SE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). For REG regions, infx(x) <= supx(x).

So, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)

This means infx(z) <= supx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for SW.

So, SW is not a possible relation.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are S and SE.

Actually let me check one more time to see if any other directional relation is possible.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the x-bounds of z)

We've confirmed supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x). The remaining condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), could be true or false depending on the specific regions. So, S is a possible relation.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)

We've confirmed supy(x) <= infy(z). The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) could be true or false depending on the specific regions. So, SE is a possible relation.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)

We've confirmed supy(x) <= infy(z). But for supx(x) <= infx(z), we derived earlier that infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which implies infx(z) <= supx(x). For supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, we'd need supx(x) = infx(z), which is a special case.

Let's check this more carefully. For supx(x) <= infx(z), we'd need x's x-interval to end before z's x-interval begins. But we've derived infx(z) <= infx(x), which means z's x-interval begins before or at the same point as x's x-interval. This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) for REG regions (unless supx(x) = infx(z), which is a special case).

So, SW is not a possible relation.

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the y-bounds of z)

As with SW, we've derived infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which implies infx(z) <= supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) for REG regions (unless supx(x) = infx(z), which is a special case). Also, from supy(x) <= infy(z), we know x is strictly below z, which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) for REG regions.

So, W is not a possible relation.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

As with W, the conditions contradict our derived constraints.

So, NW is not a possible relation.

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the x-bounds of z)

From supy(x) <= infy(z), we know x is strictly below z, which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) for REG regions.

So, N is not a possible relation.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

From supy(x) <= infy(z), we know x is strictly below z, which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) for REG regions.

So, NE is not a possible relation.

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the y-bounds of z)

From supy(x) <= infy(z), we know x is strictly below z, which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) for REG regions.

So, E is not a possible relation.

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the x-bounds of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the y-bounds of z)

From supy(x) <= infy(z), we know x is strictly below z, which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) for REG regions.

So, B is not a possible relation.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are S and SE.

It says the possible answer can be one or many of the cardinal directions. So the answer is: S, SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is S of region z

First, I'll analyze what these relations tell us:

From x SE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is within the x-bounds of z)

For the north-south relation:
- By transitivity: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

For the east-west relation:
- From the constraints: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- This means infx(z) ≤ infx(x), so x either starts after z starts or at the same point.

Now, I need to determine the possible cardinal directions:

1. S is possible if:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which we've shown is true)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   
2. SE is possible if:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which we've shown is true)
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

Both of these relations are possible because we can't establish a definitive relationship between supx(x) and supx(z) from the given constraints.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SE
