PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this problem step by step.

We have:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is W of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let me recall what these relations mean based on the given definitions:

1. x SW y means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. y W z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y extends at least as far south as z)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

Now, let's try to determine the relation between x and z.

For the x-axis (east-west):
- From x SW y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y W z, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- By transitivity, we can say supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the west of z

For the y-axis (north-south):
- From x SW y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y W z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, we need to determine the relation between supy(x) and infy(z).

From x SW y, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
From y W z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

This doesn't give us a direct comparison between supy(x) and infy(z). There are a few possibilities:

1. If infy(z) < supy(x) ≤ infy(y), then x is not strictly to the south of z.
2. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(y), then x is to the south of z.

Given these possibilities, what could be the cardinal direction relations between x and z?

Let's analyze:

1. We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is to the west of z. This means x could be W, NW, or SW of z.

2. For the north-south relation, we have two cases:
   - If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is to the south of z, which points to a SW relation.
   - If infy(z) < supy(x), the relation is more complex.

I think I made a mistake in my analysis. Let's be more precise.

From x SW y, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y W z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is in the middle of z in terms of north-south)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is to the west of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but we don't know how infy(z) compares to infy(y) or supy(x).

Actually, I made a mistake again. From y W z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y), which means z doesn't extend as far south as y. And from x SW y, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y). So, combining these, we might have supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but infy(z) can be either less than or greater than supy(x).

Wait, I need to get the relationships correct based on the definitions.

For a W b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the west of b)
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a extends at least as far south as b)
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b) (a doesn't extend beyond b to the north)

So, for y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y extends at least as far south as z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

Now, let's proceed.

From x SW y, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y W z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y extends at least as far south as z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

From these, we can deduce:
- For the east-west direction: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is to the west of z.
- For the north-south direction, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). The relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) is not fixed.

So, there are two possibilities:
1. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is to the south of z, which means x could be SW of z.
2. If infy(z) ≤ supy(x), then the relationship becomes more complex.

In the second case, we need to determine the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z). From x SW y, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y). From y W z, we have supy(y) ≤ supy(z). There's no direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Given the above, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- SW (if supy(x) < infy(z))
- W (if infy(z) ≤ supy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
- NW (if infy(z) ≤ supy(x) and supy(z) < supy(x))

But I think there's a flaw in my reasoning. If x is SW of y, it can't extend north of y, and if y is W of z, y can't extend north of z. So, the NW relation between x and z seems unlikely.

Let me reconsider.

From x SW y, supy(x) ≤ infy(y). This means x is strictly to the south of y.

From y W z, infy(z) ≤ infy(y). This means y extends at least as far south as z (or in other words, z doesn't extend as far south as y).

Now, considering the relationship between x and z on the north-south axis:
- If infy(z) ≤ supy(x), then there's an overlap in the north-south extent of x and z, so x can be W of z.
- If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is strictly to the south of z, making x SW of z.

I misunderstood earlier. If y extends at least as far south as z, then infy(y) ≤ infy(z). But from the definition, y W z means infy(z) ≤ infy(y). I need to be careful.

Let's get this right.

For a W b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the west of b)
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a extends at least as far south as b, or in other words, b doesn't extend as far south as a)
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b) (a doesn't extend beyond b to the north)

For y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y extends at least as far south as z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

From x SW y, supy(x) ≤ infy(y). And from y W z, infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Now, considering the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z):
- If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is strictly to the south of z, making x SW of z.
- If infy(z) ≤ supy(x), then there might be an overlap in the north-south extent of x and z, so x could be W of z. But this also depends on the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

Let me draw out an example to see the possible configurations.

Case 1: supy(x) < infy(z)
In this case, x is strictly to the south of z, making x SW of z.

Case 2: infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
In this case, the upper part of x might overlap with the lower part of z. Since we've already established that x is to the west of z, this could mean x is partially SW and partially W of z. But as a single relation, it would be W, because the definition of W includes infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

Wait, I need to be more precise here. The cardinal directions are based on the relative positions, not overlaps. Let's review the definitions.

For a W b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the west of b)
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a extends at least as far south as b)
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b) (a doesn't extend beyond b to the north)

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x extends at least as far south as z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

From x SW y, we don't know how infy(x) compares to infy(y). We only know supy(x) ≤ infy(y). And from y W z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). Similarly, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Given the above, there are several possible configurations for x, y, and z. Let's consider them.

1. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is W of z.
2. If infy(x) < infy(z), then x extends further south than z. This, combined with the fact that x is to the west of z, means x could be SW of z.
3. If supy(z) < supy(x), then x extends further north than z. This, combined with the fact that x is to the west of z, means x could be NW of z.
4. The fourth possibility (infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(z) < supy(x)) would mean x spans both SW and NW, which isn't one of the single-tile relations. But in the multi-tile notation, it could be something like NW:W:SW.

But hold on. Let's think about the constraints we have from the given information.

From x SW y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y). This means x is entirely to the south of y.
From y W z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means y's north-south extent is contained within z's north-south extent.

Now, just because supy(x) ≤ infy(y) doesn't necessarily mean supy(x) ≤ infy(z), because we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

So, for the north-south relation between x and z, there are two possibilities:
1. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is to the south of z.
2. If infy(z) ≤ supy(x), then x and z overlap in the north-south extent.

In the second case, we'd need to consider the full north-south extent of x and z. But we don't have information about infy(x) or supy(x) in relation to infy(z) or supy(z).

Given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z could be one of:
- SW (if supy(x) < infy(z))
- W (if x's north-south extent is contained within z's north-south extent)
- NW (if x extends further north than z)
- A multi-tile relation like NW:W, W:SW, or NW:W:SW (if x's north-south extent extends beyond z in one or both directions)

However, there's a crucial constraint I think I've been overlooking. If x is SW of y, it means x is to the south AND to the west of y. It's not just that the north-south extents don't overlap; it's that x is entirely to the south of y. Similarly, y is entirely to the west of z.

Let's go back to the definitions.

For a SW b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the west of b)
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (a is to the south of b)

For a W b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the west of b)
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a extends at least as far south as b)
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b) (a doesn't extend beyond b to the north)

Given that x is SW of y and y is W of z, let's try to deduce the constraints:

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y extends at least as far south as z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

From these, we can deduce:

For the east-west direction:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.

For the north-south direction, it's a bit more complex. We have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z on the north-south axis.

Hmm, just to be absolutely sure I'm understanding the constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) correctly: this means the lower bound of y in the y-axis is less than or equal to the lower bound of z in the y-axis, meaning y extends at least as far south as z, right?

Let me relook at the definition. For a W b, one of the conditions is infy(b) ≤ infy(a). Here, a is the primary region, and b is the reference region. So, for y W z, the condition is infy(z) ≤ infy(y), which means y extends at least as far south as z.

Given this, let's continue.

From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), we can derive:
1. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is to the south of z.
2. If infy(z) ≤ supy(x), then the north-south relation is more complex. We'd need to compare infy(x) with infy(z) and supy(x) with supy(z).

Considering the first case, if supy(x) < infy(z), then combined with the east-west relation (x is to the west of z), we have x SW z.

For the second case, where infy(z) ≤ supy(x), we have the following possibilities:
- If infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x's north-south extent partially overlaps with z's, with x extending further south. In this case, x would be to the west of z, making the relation a combination of W and SW, which in the multi-tile notation would be W:SW.
- If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x's north-south extent is contained within z's. In this case, x is W of z.
- If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) < supy(x), then x's north-south extent partially overlaps with z's, with x extending further north. In this case, x would be to the west of z, making the relation a combination of W and NW, which in the multi-tile notation would be NW:W.
- If infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(z) < supy(x), then x spans both SW and NW of z, which in the multi-tile notation would be NW:W:SW.

But actually, let me rethink this, because the question is asking about single-tile relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B), so the correct answer shouldn't involve multi-tile relations. 

For a region a to be in relation R to a region b, region a must be entirely in the area defined by relation R with respect to region b. Given this, let's reconsider.

For the east-west direction, we've established that x is to the west of z.

For the north-south direction, there are three possibilities:
1. If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is entirely to the south of z, making x SW of z.
2. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x's north-south extent is contained within z's, making x W of z.
3. If infy(x) < infy(z) or supy(z) < supy(x), then x is not entirely to the south of z or entirely within the north-south extent of z, which means x doesn't fit into a single-tile relation with respect to z. But this contradicts our assumption that the answer should be a single-tile relation.

So, given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

But I'm still puzzled by the general problem. Let's re-read the definition of cardinal direction relations again.

Actually, I need to clarify something: Are (NW:W) or (W:SW) or (NW:W:SW) valid cardinal direction relations according to the definition given? The definition says a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 9 and Ri ≠ Rj for every i, j such that 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k and i ≠ j. So multi-tile relations are valid, and I should consider them.

Let's go back to my analysis. Given that x is SW of y and y is W of z, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is entirely to the south of z)
- W (if x's north-south extent is contained within z's)
- NW:W (if x extends further north than z but still overlaps)
- W:SW (if x extends further south than z but still overlaps)
- NW:W:SW (if x spans both SW and NW of z)

But wait, the definition also says "there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG." This seems to imply that the relations R1, R2, ..., Rk are defined with respect to the same reference region.

Given that, I think the answer to the question should be a set of single-tile relations, not a multi-tile relation.

Still, I want to determine all possible relations between x and z given the constraints.

From the constraints, we've established:
- On the east-west axis, x is to the west of z.
- On the north-south axis, the relation is not fixed. Depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z, x could be to the south of z, overlap with z in the north-south extent, or span both north and south of z.

Let's consider all possible single-tile relations and check which ones satisfy these constraints:
- N: This would mean x is to the north of z, which contradicts the fact that x can be to the south of z or overlap with z in the north-south extent.
- NE: This would mean x is to the north and east of z, which contradicts the fact that x is to the west of z.
- E: This would mean x is to the east of z, which contradicts the fact that x is to the west of z.
- SE: This would mean x is to the south and east of z, which contradicts the fact that x is to the west of z.
- S: This would mean x is to the south of z, which contradicts the fact that x can overlap with z in the north-south extent.
- SW: This would mean x is to the south and west of z, which is consistent with our constraints if x is entirely to the south of z.
- W: This would mean x is to the west of z with its north-south extent contained within that of z, which is consistent with our constraints.
- NW: This would mean x is to the north and west of z, which is consistent with our constraints if x is entirely to the north of z (which could happen if supy(z) < infy(x)).
- B: This would mean x is inside the bounding box of z, which contradicts the fact that x is to the west of z.

So, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

But wait, I think I made a mistake. Let's reconsider the constraint y W z. From the definition, this means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y extends at least as far south as z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

Now, let's consider the constraint x SW y. From the definition, this means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From these two constraints, we can derive:
- On the east-west axis, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.
- On the north-south axis, supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y). The relation between supy(x) and infy(z) is not directly determined.

If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is entirely to the south of z, making x SW of z.
If infy(z) ≤ supy(x), then the north-south relation is more complex.

Now, for x to be NW of z, we would need supy(z) < infy(x), which means x is entirely to the north of z. But from the constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north). This gives us supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). Therefore, it's not possible for supy(z) < infy(x), which means x cannot be NW of z.

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x extends at least as far south as z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the third condition is satisfied. But we don't have a direct relation between infy(x) and infy(z), so we can't say for sure if the second condition is satisfied.

That said, since x is SW of y, it's to the south of y, which means it's likely (though not necessarily) lower down than z. This makes the relation W less likely, but still possible.

So, the possible single-tile relations between x and z based on the given constraints are SW and W.

Let's try to simplify this. We have:
- x is SW of y.
- y is W of z.

Given this, we can deduce:
- On the east-west axis, x is to the west of z.
- On the north-south axis, x can be to the south of z or overlap with z. It can't be entirely to the north of z.

For x to be SW of z, it would need to be entirely to the south and entirely to the west of z. We've established that x is to the west of z, and it's possible for x to be entirely to the south of z. So, SW is a possible relation.

For x to be W of z, it would need to be entirely to the west of z, with its north-south extent contained within that of z. We've established that x is to the west of z, but we don't know for sure if the north-south constraint is satisfied. But it's possible, making W a potential relation.

For x to be NW of z, it would need to be entirely to the north and entirely to the west of z. We've established that x is to the west of z, but given the constraints, it's not possible for x to be entirely to the north of z. So, NW is not a possible relation.

Actually, let me double check the conclusion that x can't be entirely to the north of z. 

From the constraints, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is not to the north of z)

This gives us supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means the upper bound of x is less than or equal to the upper bound of z.

For x to be entirely to the north of z, we would need supy(z) < infy(x). But from the derived relation above, we have supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which means it's not possible for supy(z) < infy(x) (since infy(x) ≤ supy(x)).

Therefore, the conclusion that x can't be entirely to the north of z is correct, and NW is not a possible relation.

The possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

Now let's go back to the definition of W relation and try once more because I'm not sure I got it right: For a W b, we need:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the west of b)
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a extends at least as far south as b, or in other words, the lower bound of a in the y-axis is less than or equal to the lower bound of b in the y-axis)
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b) (a doesn't extend beyond b to the north, or in other words, the upper bound of a in the y-axis is less than or equal to the upper bound of b in the y-axis)

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x extends at least as far south as z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

From the constraints, we've established:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (derived from supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z))

But we don't have a direct relation between infy(z) and infy(x). For x to be W of z, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x doesn't extend further south than z.

From the given constraints (x SW y and y W z), we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y extends at least as far south as z)

The relation between infy(z) and infy(x) is not directly determined from these constraints. However, given that x is to the south of y and y extends at least as far south as z, it's quite possible (though not guaranteed) that x extends further south than z, which would mean infy(x) < infy(z). If that's the case, x wouldn't be W of z, but rather (W:SW).

But again, we're looking for single-tile relations. If we allow for the possibility that infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then W is a possible relation. We can't dismiss it based on the given constraints.

So, I'll stick with my conclusion: the possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

Actually, let me adjust my answer after further contemplation. Let's approach the problem more systematically and make sure the constraints are clear.

Given data:
- Region x is SW of region y: This means x is strictly to the south and west of y, with supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
- Region y is W of region z: This means y is strictly to the west of z, with supx(y) ≤ infx(z), and the north-south extent of y is constrained by infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From these, we can deritve:
1. On the east-west axis, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which implies x is to the west of z.
2. On the north-south axis, supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), plus supy(y) ≤ supy(z). We don't have a direct comparison between supy(x) and infy(z).

The single-tile relations that have the primary region to the west of the reference region are W, NW, and SW. The question is, which of these can be valid for x in relation to z?

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (Already established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x extends at least as far south as z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (Already established)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of z)

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (Already established)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is entirely to the south of z)

From our derived relations, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y). If infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (which we know), we can't directly determine the relation between supy(x) and infy(z).

Let's further analyze each of the three relations:

1. NW (x is to the north and west of z):
   For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north). This gives us infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x can't be NW of z, and NW is not a possible relation.

2. SW (x is to the south and west of z):
   For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   We don't have a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z), so SW is a potential relation.

3. W (x is to the west of z with its north-south extent contained within z's):
   For x to be W of z, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so the latter condition is satisfied. But we don't have a direct relation between infy(z) and infy(x). Given that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and x is to the south of y, it's possible that infy(x) < infy(z), which would make W not a valid relation. But it's also possible that infy(z) ≤ infy(x), making W a valid relation. So, W is a potential relation.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

Specifically, if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is SW of z. This is possible even if infy(x) < infy(z). If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is W of z.

Hmm, I'm not certain that I've been reasoning correctly about the relation between x and z based on the constraints. Let's try a more direct approach, reasoning directly from the definitions.

Given data:
- Region x is SW of region y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- Region y is W of region z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

For the east-west axis, we have:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
This means x is to the west of z.

For the north-south axis, we have:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From these, we can make the following deductions:
- x is to the west of z.
- x is entirely to the south of y.
- y's north-south extent is contained within z's (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

But we don't have a direct relation between x's and z's north-south extents. Specifically, we don't know the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z).

For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We don't know if this holds.

For x to be W of z, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
We have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
So, supy(x) ≤ supy(z) holds. But the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x) is not known.

For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
But from supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
For supy(z) ≤ infy(x) to hold, we would need infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is only possible if supy(x) = supy(z) = infy(x). Given the strict inequalities in the original constraints, this is highly unlikely.

So, based on the given constraints, NW is not a possible relation between x and z.

The possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

Let's further consider if there are any other potential relations.

For x to be B (inside the bounding box) of z, we would need:
infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
But from supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the requirement infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, B is not a possible relation.

For x to be N, NE, E, or SE of z, it would need to be to the east of z, which contradicts the fact that x is to the west of z. So, these are not possible relations.

For x to be S of z, it would need to be to the south of z and its east-west extent should be contained within z's east-west extent. The first condition is possible, but the second is contradicted by the fact that x is to the west of z. So, S is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are SW and W. And actually, there's another option: NW:W:SW, which is a multi-tile relation. If x's north-south extent spans both north and south of z while being entirely to the west of z, it would correspond to this relation. But let's stick to the single-tile relations as mentioned in the problem.

Just to double check the case for NW: could x possibly be to the northwest of z?

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

While the first condition is met, the second requires that the upper bound of z in the y-axis is less than or equal to the lower bound of x in the y-axis. This would mean x is entirely to the north of z.

From the given constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (which means x is to the south of y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (which means y's upper bound is less than or equal to z's). Combining these, we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

For supy(z) ≤ infy(x) to be true, we would need supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But infy(x) ≤ supy(x) by definition, so the chain of inequalities becomes infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z). This is a very strict condition and, given the constraints, it's highly unlikely.

So, I still believe NW is not a practical possibilty, and the possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

Actually, let me re-read the definition of "NW" relation again more carefully to make sure I haven't misunderstood.

For a NW b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the west of b)
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is to the north of b)

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

From the constraints, we've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so the first condition is met.

For the second condition, we need to determine if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) can hold.

From x SW y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y), which means x is to the south of y.
From y W z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Despite x SW y and y W z, these constraints don't directly enforce a relation between supy(z) and infy(x). However, there's an important detail to consider: x is SW of y, which means x is entirely to the south of y. And since y is generally positioned above x, and z is generally positioned to the east of y, it's intuitive that x should be to the south or possibly to the west of z, but not entirely to the north of z. But let's try to formalize this intuition.

From x SW y, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
From y W z, we have supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Now, for x to be entirely to the north of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
But infy(x) ≤ supy(x) by definition.

Combining all these: infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

This contradicts the required supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x to be NW of z.

Therefore, x cannot be NW of z, and thus, NW is not a possible relation.

Alright, let me just double-check if x can be S, SE, E, NE, or N of z. But these are all easy to check, since x has to be west of z (because of the east-west constraint), the relation can only be W, NW, or SW. The other possibilities would require x to be, at least partially, to the east of z, which contradicts the established constraint.

To summarize, based on the given constraints and the cardinal direction definitions:
- x is to the west of z.
- On the north-south axis, x can either be to the south of z or have its north-south extent overlap with z's.

The possible single-tile relations between x and z are SW (if x is to the south of z) and W (if x's north-south extent overlaps with z's).

OK, let's approach this more systematically and make sure that our answer is correct, because I'm not convinced that W is a possibility: Remember that for x to have a W relation with z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (We've already established this)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (This requires x not to extend further south than z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (We've already established this)

Let me make a diagram to help understand the constraints.

Given x SW y and y W z, we know:
- x is entirely to the south and west of y.
- y is entirely to the west of z, and its north-south extent is constrained by infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- On the east-west axis, x is to the west of z.
- On the north-south axis, the relation is not fixed. The constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) means z doesn't extend as far south as y. And from x SW y, we know x is to the south of y.

Can we have infy(z) ≤ infy(x)?

Actually, I think so. The SW relation tells us that x is to the south of y, but it doesn't specify how far south x extends. It's conceivable that x doesn't extend as far south as z, which would mean infy(z) ≤ infy(x). For intance, imagine z is a very tall region that extends very far south; it's still possible that the W constraint between y and z is satisfied.
Given this, both SW and W are possible relations between x and z.

To visualize the W relation, imagine x is directly to the west of z, and its north-south extent is contained within z's north-south extent. Given x SW y, we'd have x to the south of y, and given y W z, we'd have y to the west of z with its north-south extent contained within z's. This configuration is consistent with the constraints.

Let me try to clarify the one confusing point: can W relation between x and z coexist with SW relation between x and y?

For x W z, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
From x SW y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
From y W z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

But there's no direct constraint relating infy(x) and infy(y), or infy(x) and infy(z).

I think I'm understanding the situation better now. It's quite possible for x to be SW of y and for x to be W of z. For instance, imagine x is a small region to the south-west of y, z is a very tall region to the east of y, and y is to the west of z. In this configuration, it's possible for x to be W of z if x doesn't extend further south than z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are SW and W. But actually, there's a third possibility that I hadn't been considering: the NW relation. If x extends further north than z, it could be NW of z.

However, for x to be NW of z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

From x SW y, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y).
From y W z, we know supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend further north than z).

Combining these, we get: infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

This contradicts the required supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x to be NW of z. So, NW is not a possible relation.

To sum up, the possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

Actually, let me illustrate one more way that W can be a possibility. Imagine x is a small region to the south-west of y, very close to y, and z is a very tall region to the east of y that extends far south, such that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). In this configuration, x would be W of z, satisfying all the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

Actually, I think I should reason this through more carefully, considering the definition of the cardinal direction relations.
For a SW b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the west of b)
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (a is to the south of b)

For a W b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the west of b)
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a extends at least as far south as b)
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b) (a doesn't extend beyond b to the north)

For a NW b:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is to the west of b)
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is to the north of b)

Let's actually try to envision some concrete scenarios and see the relations:

Scenario 1: x is entirely to the south of z (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
In this case, x is SW of z.

Scenario 2: x's north-south extent overlaps with z's, with x not extending further south than z (i.e., infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
In this case, x is W of z. But can this scenario be realized given the constraints?

From x SW y, we know x is entirely to the south of y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)). And from y W z, we know z doesn't extend as far south as y (infy(z) ≤ infy(y)).

For x to not extend further south than z (i.e., infy(z) ≤ infy(x)), we'd need specific positioning. For instance, if infy(z) = infy(y) (z extends only just as far south as y) and infy(x) = infy(y) (x extends only just as far south as y), then infy(z) = infy(x), satisfying the condition.

While this is a specific case, it's not impossible. So, W is a possible relation.

Scenario 3: x is entirely to the north of z (i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
As we've established, this is not possible given the constraints. So, NW is not a possible relation.

Alright, it's clearer to me that the possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

Actually, let me try to formally work the problem for one more time:

Given info:
1. Region x is SW of region y. This means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. Region y is W of region z. This means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y extends at least as far south as z)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

From 1 and 2, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This implies x is to the west of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from 1) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from 2), which means supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This implies x doesn't extend beyond z to the north.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from 1) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from 2). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Now, considering the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

For SW (x is to the south-west of z):
- x is to the west of z (we've established this)
- x is to the south of z (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z))

Given the constraints, it's not clear if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is always satisfied. It could be, but it's not guaranteed. So, SW is a potential relation.

For W (x is to the west of z with its north-south extent contained within z's):
- x is to the west of z (we've established this)
- x doesn't extend further south than z (i.e., infy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- x doesn't extend beyond z to the north (i.e., supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) (we've established this)

Again, from the constraints, it's not clear if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is always satisfied. But as I've shown in a specific example, it's a possibility. So, W is also a potential relation.

For NW (x is to the north-west of z):
- x is to the west of z (we've established this)
- x is to the north of z (i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

Given supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), we can derive infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x to be NW of z. So, NW is not a possible relation.

For other relations like N, NE, E, SE, S, and B, x is not entirely to the west of z, which contradicts the established constraint. So, these are not possible relations.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are SW and W.

Therefore, the answer to the original question "If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is: SW and W.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

First, let me analyze what we know:
- x is SW of y, meaning: 
  * supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
  * supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

- y is W of z, meaning:
  * supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
  * infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y extends at least as far south as z)
  * supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

From these constraints, I can deduce:
1. For east-west positioning: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is west of z.

2. For north-south positioning:
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
   - We know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z doesn't extend as far south as y)
   - We know supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

Based on these constraints, the possible relations are:

SW: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is entirely south of z, making the relation SW.

W: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is west of z with its north-south extent contained within z's extent, making the relation W.

The constraints don't allow for any other single-tile relation between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: W, SW
