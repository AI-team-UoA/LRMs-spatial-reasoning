PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the configurations where region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z.

Given:
- x S y: This means that region x is to the South of region y. In terms of coordinates, this means supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- y W z: This means that region y is to the West of region z. In terms of coordinates, this means supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Now, let's determine what relation could hold between x and z.

From x S y, we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is not to the left of y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is not to the right of y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is not below z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is not above z)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x S y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x S y)

Given the constraints, let's consider what relation might hold between x and z:

1. Could x be S of z?
   - For x S z, we need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - From the given constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y).
   - From these, we can't directly determine if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) because we don't know the exact relationship between infy(y) and infy(z), other than infy(z) ≤ infy(y).
   - Since infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), it's possible that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but it's also possible that supy(x) > infy(z).
   - We also don't know if infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - So, x S z is a possibility but not guaranteed.

2. Could x be SW of z?
   - For x SW z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - From the given constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
   - From these, we can conclude supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - Again, we don't know for sure if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - So, x SW z is also a possibility.

3. Could x be W of z?
   - For x W z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - As determined earlier, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so this condition is satisfied.
   - We don't know for sure if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We also don't know if supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - So, x W z is a possibility but not guaranteed.

4. Could x be NW of z?
   - For x NW z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - As determined earlier, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so this condition is satisfied.
   - For supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we don't have enough information to determine.
   - So, x NW z is a possibility but not guaranteed. In fact, given that x is S of y, and y is generally at the same vertical level as z (due to y W z), it seems unlikely that x would be to the NW of z, but we can't rule it out based on the given constraints.

5. Could x be N of z?
   - For x N z, we need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We can't determine if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) or if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) given the constraints.
   - This seems highly unlikely given that x is S of y, and y is generally at the same vertical level as z, but we can't rule it out based on the given constraints.

6. Could x be NE of z?
   - For x NE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We have no information to determine if supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Given that x is S of y and y is W of z, it seems very unlikely that x would be to the NE of z, but we can't rule it out based solely on the given constraints.

7. Could x be E of z?
   - For x E z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We have no information to determine if supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Given that y is W of z and x is generally to the right of y (since infx(y) ≤ infx(x)), it seems unlikely that x would be to the E of z, but it's not impossible based on the given constraints.

8. Could x be SE of z?
   - For x SE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - Again, we have no information to determine if supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Given that x is S of y and y is W of z, it seems unlikely that x would be to the SE of z, but it's not impossible based on the given constraints.

9. Could x be B of z (i.e., within the bounding box of z)?
   - For x B z, we need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We have conflicting information; from the constraints, we know that supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which implies that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), contradicting supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - This means x cannot be B of z.

Let's re-think this more carefully:

Given:
- x S y: Region x is to the South of region y. This means:
  - Region x is below region y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
  - Region x is horizontally aligned with region y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
  
- y W z: Region y is to the West of region z. This means:
  - Region y is to the left of region z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
  - Region y is vertically aligned with region z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x S y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)
- This gives us: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means region x is to the left of region z.

- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z)
- From these, we can't directly determine the vertical relationship between regions x and z. But since Supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), there are a few possibilities:
  1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(y): In this case, region x is below region z.
  2. infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y): In this case, regions x and z overlap vertically, but region x is still below region y.

Based on the possible vertical relationships, the cardinal direction relations between region x and region z could be:
- SW: If region x is below and to the left of region z (case 1 above).
- W: If region x is vertically aligned with region z (has some vertical overlap) and is to the left of it (case 2 above).

Let me re-check if there are any other potential relationships. On further reflection:

For the cardinal directions, we need to consider the relative positions of the regions in the x and y axes:

For regions x and z:
- In the x-axis: We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means region x is strictly to the left of region z.
- In the y-axis: We have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but these don't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z), or between infy(x) and supy(z).

Given the vertical uncertainty, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z (from the perspective of x relative to z) could be:
- SW: If region x is below and to the left of region z.
- W: If region x is at the same vertical level as region z and to the left of it.
- NW: If region x is above and to the left of region z.

Wait, I think I'm forgetting something. Region x is South of region y, which means region x is below region y. And region y is West of region z, which means region y and region z are roughly at the same vertical level. In this configuration, it's highly unlikely that region x would be above region z (which would make it NW of z). 

But, to be thorough, let me reconsider the constraints and check if NW is a possibility.

From x S y, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (region x is below region y)

From y W z, we have:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (region z is not below region y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (region z is not below region y)

From these constraints, there's no direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would mean region x is above region z. But given the general configuration where x is below y and y is at roughly the same vertical level as z, it seems more likely that x is below or at the same vertical level as z, making SW or W the more likely relations.

But since this is just for me to try to figure out the answer, I should be thorough and include the NW relation as a theoretical possibility (though it seems unlikely in the real world).

Let me now double-check by drawing what the configuration looks like, to make sure my reasoning is sound.

If we denote the corners of a region a by infx(a), infy(a) (bottom-left) and supx(a), supy(a) (top-right), then for region x to be South of region y, the northern boundary of x should not extend beyond the southern boundary of y. Similarly, for region y to be West of region z, the eastern boundary of y should not extend beyond the western boundary of z.

Given:
- x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Now, the vertical relationship between regions x and z:
We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y).
But in the instructions, it says "infy(z) <= infy(y)" from "y W z", so we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Let's look at the upper bound of z in the y-direction. We know supy(y) ≤ supy(z) from "y W z".
But again, we don't have direct constraints on the relationship between region x and region z in the y-direction.

Actually, wait. There are more constraints from the definitions:

- x S y: 
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (region x is below region y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (region x is not to the left of region y in the x-axis)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (region x is not to the right of region y in the x-axis)

- y W z:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (region y is to the left of region z in the x-axis)
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (region z is not below region y in the y-axis)
  - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (region z is not below region y in the y-axis)

Actually, I think the constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(y) from "x S y" and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) from "y W z" gives us supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means region x is definitely to the west of region z.

However, the vertical relationship is still uncertain. The constraints give us:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) from "x S y"
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) from "y W z"
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) from "y W z"

But these don't give us a direct constraint on the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x). So, it's possible that:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (region x is below region z, making the relation SW)
2. infy(z) ≤ supy(x) and infy(x) ≤ supy(z) (regions x and z overlap vertically, making the relation W)
3. supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (region x is above region z, making the relation NW)

But considering the general configuration where x is below y and y is at the same vertical level as z, the third scenario seems unlikely. However, I can't rule it out based on the constraints alone.

So based on purely the information given, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be:
- SW: If region x is below and to the left of region z.
- W: If region x has some vertical overlap with region z and is to the left of it.
- NW: If region x is above and to the left of region z.

But I think the most likely configurations are SW and W, with NW being less plausible given the typical configuration of the regions.

Hmm, let me recheck if my logical deductions above are correct, by redoing the analysis.

First, let's start with what we're given:
- Region x is S of region y.
- Region y is W of region z.

From the definition of S:
- For x S y, we need: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

From the definition of W:
- For y W z, we need: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From these constraints, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x S y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)
- This gives us: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This means region x is to the west (left) of region z. But the vertical relationship between them is not constrained by the given information.

Now, let's check each possible cardinal direction relation:

1. SW: For x SW z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We've already established supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - From the constraints, we don't have a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is possible.
   - SW is a possibility.

2. W: For x W z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We've already established supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - From the constraints, we don't have direct relations for the vertical conditions, so W is possible.

3. NW: For x NW z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We've already established supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - From the constraints, we don't have a direct relation for the vertical condition, so NW is possible.

4. N, NE, E, SE, S, B: These all seem inconsistent with the constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which places region x to the west of region z.

hmm, let me carefully reconsider.

For N: For x N z, we need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

For NE: For x NE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which suggests region x is to the west of region z, contradicting supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

For E: For x E z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Again, the constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

For SE: For x SE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

For S: For x S z, we need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

For B: For x B z, we need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z) contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

So, it does seem like the only possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW.

But actually, I think we can rule out more.

From x S y, we get:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y W z, we get:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's consider the vertical relationship again:
- From x S y, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- From y W z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Given supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), we have a few cases:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
2. infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

In case 1, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means region x is below region z. This would give us the SW relation.

In case 2, we have infy(z) ≤ supy(x), which means there's some vertical overlap between regions x and z. For the W relation, we also need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Given the constraints, we don't have direct information about infy(x) or supy(z). But, from the y W z constraint, we have supy(y) ≤ supy(z), and from the x S y constraint, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y). This means supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), establishing supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

We also know from x S y that supy(x) ≤ infy(y), and from y W z that infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we can't derive a specific relation between infy(x) and infy(z) from these.

So, the W relation is a possibility, but we can't confirm it without more information.

Hmm, actually, let me consider the NW relation more carefully. For x NW z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- We know infy(x) ≤ supy(x) (this is obvious because 'inf' is less than or equal to 'sup').
- From x S y, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- So, infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- From y W z, we have supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
- But, we don't have direct information to relate supy(z) and infy(x).

Without knowing the direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x), I can't rule out the NW relation based on the constraints.

Actually, i realized i made a mistake. The way i tried to exclude the NW relationship was by using:
- From x S y, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- From y W z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

But I can't directly related supy(x) and infy(z) from these; I was incorrectly assuming that if supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), then supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which isn't necessarily true. So, I can't rule out the NW relation based on the given constraints.

Let me double check a couple of cases where we have x S y and y W z:
- Case 1: The region x is below and to the right of region y, and region y is to the left of region z, with some vertical overlap. This configuration would place region x below or partially below region z, making the relation between x and z either SW or W. This is for the case x S y due to x being to the south of y (not to the southwest, as x is to the right of y), and y W z.

- Case 2: The region x is below region y (and not necessarily to the right), and region y is to the left of region z, with region z being much lower than region y. In this configuration, region x could potentially be above region z, making the relation NW.

Given these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

Actually, I'm overthinking this a bit. Let me simplify.

Given:
- x S y
- y W z

From these, we know:
- Region x is south of region y.
- Region y is west of region z.

Based on the definitions, the only guaranteed relation we have is that region x is to the west of region z. The vertical relationship between x and z can vary, making the possible relations:
- SW: If region x is to the south-west of region z.
- W: If region x is to the west of region z, with some vertical overlap.
- NW: If region x is to the north-west of region z.

So the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

I'm very confident that the answer is SW, W, or NW.

But to make 100% sure, let me double-check our reasoning by translating back to the original cardinal direction definitions.

For x S y, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y), which means region x is below region y.
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y), which means region x is horizontally aligned with region y.

For y W z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means region y is to the left of region z.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means region y is vertically aligned with region z.

Now, for the possible directions between x and z:

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which we get from supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x S y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z).
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which we can't determine directly from the constraints.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which we've already established.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which we can't determine directly from the constraints.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which we've already established.
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which we can't determine directly from the constraints.

So, based on the cardinal direction definitions, the possible relations between x and z are indeed SW, W, and NW, which is consistent with my previous analysis.

One last thought: I thought initially that NW would be highly improbable given the setup. Let's consider a simple example.

Let's say:
- Region y is at position (1, 2) to (2, 3) on a 2D plane.
- Region z is at position (3, 2) to (4, 3).
- Region x is at position (1, 0) to (2, 1).

Then:
- x S y: Yes, because region x (1, 0) to (2, 1) is to the south of region y (1, 2) to (2, 3).
- y W z: Yes, because region y (1, 2) to (2, 3) is to the west of region z (3, 2) to (4, 3).
- x ?? z: In this case, region x is to the south-west of region z, making the direction SW.

But we can also imagine a case:
- Region y is at position (1, 2) to (2, 3) on a 2D plane.
- Region z is at position (3, 0) to (4, 1).
- Region x is at position (1, 1.5) to (2, 2.5).

Then:
- x S y: Yes, because region x (1, 1.5) to (2, 2.5) is to the south of region y (1, 2) to (2, 3).
- y W z: Yes, because region y (1, 2) to (2, 3) is to the west of region z (3, 0) to (4, 1).
- x ?? z: In this case, region x is to the north-west of region z, making the direction NW.

So, the NW relationship is definitely a possibility.

The possibilities for the relationship between x and z are: SW, W, and NW.

Actually, I realized that another configuration can give us a W relationship:
- Region y is at position (1, 2) to (2, 3) on a 2D plane.
- Region z is at position (3, 2) to (4, 3).
- Region x is at position (1, 1.5) to (2, 2.5).

- x S y: Yes, because region x (1, 1.5) to (2, 2.5) is to the south of region y (1, 2) to (2, 3).
- y W z: Yes, because region y (1, 2) to (2, 3) is to the west of region z (3, 2) to (4, 3).
- x ?? z: In this case, region x is to the west of region z, with a vertical overlap, making the direction W.

Actually, given these concrete examples, it's reassuring that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are indeed SW, W, and NW.

So, the answer is SW, W, and NW. x can be SW, W, or NW of z.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x S y (region x is South of region y)
- y W z (region y is West of region z)

From these relations, I can derive:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

This means region x is definitely to the west of region z. However, the vertical relationship is not fully constrained.

The possible relations are:
- SW (if region x is below region z)
- W (if regions x and z have vertical overlap)
- NW (if region x is above region z)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, W, NW.
