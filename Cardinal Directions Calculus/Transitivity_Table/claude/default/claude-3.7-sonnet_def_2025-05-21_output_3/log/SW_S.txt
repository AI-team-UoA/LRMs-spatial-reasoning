PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

In this problem, we have:
1. Region x is SW of region y
2. Region y is S of region z

And we need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let's think about what these relations mean geometrically:

1. Region x is SW of region y means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. Region y is S of region z means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally contained within the projection of z)

Now, let's analyze what constraints these place on the relationship between x and z:

From #1, we know that x is to the west of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
From #2, we know that infx(z) ≤ infx(y)

However, this doesn't give us a direct constraint between supx(x) and infx(z). X could be to the west of z (if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), or it could overlap with z horizontally.

From #1, we know that x is to the south of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
From #2, we know that y is to the south of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
So, x is definitely to the south of z: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's consider the possible horizontal relationships:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the south of z, x would be SW of z.

2. If infx(z) < supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x horizontally overlaps with z but is still to the west of z's right boundary. Combined with the fact that x is to the south of z, x could be S of z or SW of z, depending on whether x is completely horizontally contained within z's projection.

3. If supx(z) < supx(x), this would mean x extends further to the east than z. But from our given constraints, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This means case 3 isn't possible.

Let's further refine case 2:
- If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is horizontally contained within the projection of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the south of z, x would be S of z.
- If infx(x) < infx(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x starts to the left of z but is still contained within z's right boundary. Combined with the fact that x is to the south of z, x would be SW and S of z, which is not a valid single cardinal direction. But in the multi-tile model, this would be represented as SW:S.

But wait, I'm not sure if my analysis for case 2 is correct. Let me revisit the definitions.

From the definitions, a single-tile cardinal direction S is defined as:
a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)

This means that for x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)

From the definitions, a single-tile cardinal direction SW is defined as:
a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

This means that for x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

From our given constraints:
- We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x is to the south of z.
- We know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y).

But we don't know the direct relationship between infx(y) and infx(z). However, we know that infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from the definition of y being S of z). This means infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and since supx(x) ≤ infx(y), we can only conclude that supx(x) might be less than or equal to infx(z).

This means that x could be SW of z (if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) or x could have a more complex relationship with z.

From the constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z's left boundary is to the left of or at y's left boundary)

Given these, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. SW: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z and to the south of z, making it SW of z.

2. S: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is horizontally contained within the projection of z and to the south of z, making it S of z.

But there's another possibility:

3. W: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is vertically contained within the projection of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the west of z (assuming supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), x would be W of z.

Actually, I'm not sure if 3 is possible. Let's check again:

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom boundary is above or at z's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is below or at z's top boundary)

We know that:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Combining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x to be W of z. So, x cannot be W of z.

Actually, let me further check if S is possible:

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)

We know that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z's left boundary is to the left of or at y's left boundary)

From these, we can deduce that supx(x) ≤ infx(y), but we can't ensure that infx(z) ≤ infx(x). If infx(x) < infx(z), then x is not S of z. But if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), it's still possible for x to be S of z, as long as the other conditions are met.

Let's check the condition supx(x) ≤ supx(z) for x to be S of z:
- We know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- We also know that supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally contained within the projection of z)

Since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), we can conclude that supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

So, for x to be S of z, the only condition that might not be met is infx(z) ≤ infx(x). If infx(x) < infx(z), then x is not S of z.

Now, let's check if x can be SW of z:

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

We know that:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (from our earlier derivation)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)

But we don't know the direct relationship between infx(y) and infx(z). We know that infx(z) ≤ infx(y), which means that y's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary. Given this, if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is SW of z. But if infx(z) < supx(x) ≤ infx(y), then x is not SW of z.

So, both S and SW are possible relations between x and z, depending on the exact positions of the regions. Additionally, if x spans both the S and SW regions relative to z, then the relation would be S:SW in the multi-tile model.

But I also need to check other possible directions.

Let's see if x can be SE of z:

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

We know that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z's left boundary is to the left of or at y's left boundary)

Given these constraints, it doesn't seem possible for x to be to the east of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)). This is because if supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), it's challenging to establish that supx(z) ≤ infx(x), unless we have more information about the positioning.

Actually I think I can show that SE is not possible. If x is SE of z, then supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we also know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (which means infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). 

Now, if infx(z) ≤ infx(y), it doesn't provide a direct constraint on supx(z). However, if z and y are distinct regions with non-overlapping horizontal projections (as suggested by the y is S of z relation), then likely supx(z) ≥ supx(y). Given that supx(y) ≥ infx(y) ≥ infx(x), we'd have supx(z) ≥ infx(x), which contradicts the condition for x to be SE of z. 

But this reasoning assumes specific layouts, and without more details, I can't definitively rule out SE. 

Actually let's check the definition of "y is S of z" again. It means supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z). This doesn't necessarily mean that y and z have non-overlapping horizontal projections; it just means that y's horizontal projection is contained within z's horizontal projection.

So, it's possible for y to be directly below z. If that's the case, and x is SW of y, then x could potentially be SW, S, or W of z, depending on the exact positions.

Let's revisit. We have:
- Region x is SW of region y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y))
- Region y is S of region z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z))

From these, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so x is to the south of z.

The horizontal relationship is a bit more complex:
- We know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- We know that infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally contained within z's projection)

From these, we can derive that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z. Otherwise, if infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y), then x and z overlap horizontally. But since x is to the south of z, the possible relations are:

- SW: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is SW of z.
- S: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is S of z.

Let's also check if x can be any of the other cardinal directions relative to z:

NW: For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z). This contradicts the condition for x to be NW of z. So, x cannot be NW of z.

N: For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Similar to the NW case, this contradicts the derived condition that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

NE: For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But, as shown above, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not possible. So, x cannot be NE of z.

E: For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y). But we also know that supx(y) ≤ supx(z) from the y is S of z relation. So, infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). This contradicts the derived inequality supx(z) ≤ infx(y). So, x cannot be E of z.

SE: For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so the second condition is met. However, the first condition, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), leads to a contradiction using similar reasoning as the E direction. So, x cannot be SE of z.

W: For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom boundary is above or at z's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is below or at z's top boundary)

We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z). So, the third condition is satisfied.
However, the second condition, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts the derived relation supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as this would imply infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is inconsistent with infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be W of z.

B: For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom boundary is above or at z's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is below or at z's top boundary)

We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z). So, the fourth condition is satisfied.
However, the third condition, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts the derived relation supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as this would imply infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is inconsistent with infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

So far, the only valid relations are SW and S. But let's also consider the multi-tile relations. It could be possible that x spans both the SW and S regions relative to z, which would give a multi-tile relation of SW:S.

Let's also check if a multi-tile relation W:SW is possible:

For x to be W:SW of z, it needs to span both the W and SW regions relative to z. But as shown above, x cannot be W of z, so this multi-tile relation is not possible.

Similarly, for a multi-tile relation W:SW:S to be valid, x needs to span the W, SW, and S regions relative to z. Again, since x cannot be W of z, this multi-tile relation is not possible.

I realize that the condition x is SW of y and y is S of z doesn't prevent x from potentially overlapping with z in specific ways, beyond just being S or SW of z. But from the definitions I was given, it seems like the only valid single-tile cardinal directions for x relative to z are SW and S.

Let me visualize this to make sure I understand the possible configuration:

1. If region x is SW of region y, then x is to the southwest of y (both below and to the left).
2. If region y is S of region z, then y is directly below z, with its horizontal projection contained within z's horizontal projection.

Given these conditions, region x is definitely to the south of region z. Horizontally, x could be either to the left of z (making it SW of z) or it could have its horizontal projection partially or fully contained within z's horizontal projection (making it S of z or the multi-tile relation SW:S).

Actually let me revisit the problem with a clearer mind. I'll use some diagrams to help:

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is S of region z

For x to be SW of y:
```
    y
  x
```

For y to be S of z:
```
  z
  y
```

Combining:
```
  z
  y
x
```

In this simplistic diagram, it looks like x would be SW of z. But it's also possible that x and z have some horizontal overlap. Let's visualize this:
```
  z
  y
 x
```

In this case, x could be S of z or SW of z, or it could span both, giving a multi-tile relation SW:S.

Let me approach this systematically.

For x to be SW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For y to be S of z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) , which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is to the south of z.
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). This doesn't give a direct constraint between supx(x) and infx(z).

For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). We don't know this directly, but it's a possibility.
For x to be S of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We're not sure about the first condition, but the second condition is likely: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). But to be be S of x, we also need the restriction that infx(z) ≤ infx(x). Whether this is true or not depends on the exact positioning of the regions.

Let's consider the case where x is neither SW of z nor S of z, but maybe a combination of both or some other cardinal direction:

If x is not SW of z, then: infx(z) < supx(x).
If x is not S of z, then: infx(x) < infx(z) or supx(z) < supx(x). Given our constraints, it's likely that supx(x) ≤ supx(z), so the condition becomes: infx(x) < infx(z).

If x part of x is SW of z, part of x is S of z, that would mean x spans both the SW and S tiles, giving a multi-tile relation SW:S.

But I already showed that if x is to the south of z, and given x is SW of y and y is S of z, the only possible single-tile cardinal direction relations are SW and S.

Let me double check if there are any other potential multi-tile relations:

1. SE: x is to the southeast of z. This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so the second condition is met. But for the first condition, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x is SW of y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y is S of z). This would mean infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y), and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). It's hard to establish a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x) without more information. But given that infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), it's possible that supx(z) is much larger than infx(x), making SE a possibility.

Actually I checked before that x cannot be SE of z:

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y). But we also know that supx(y) ≤ supx(z) from the y is S of z relation. So, infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). This contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(y), which was derived from supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ infx(y). So, x cannot be SE of z.

let's carefully follow the logic:

1. x is SW of y:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

2. y is S of z:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, for x to be SE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

We know that:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x is SW of y)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y is S of z)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y is S of z)

If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then infx(x) ≥ supx(z). But since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x is SW of y), we'd have supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

However, from y is S of z, we know infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). This gives us infx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Combining the two inequalities, we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(z), which implies supx(z) = infx(y).

This can be true, but it's a very specific configuration where z's right boundary aligns exactly with y's left boundary, which seems unlikely in a general case.

But it's worth taking a step back. We know that infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y).

If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then we'd have:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) 
supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y)

But also from y is S of z, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z). Since infx(y) ≤ supx(y), we have:
infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, we have:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
infx(y) ≤ supx(z)

This means infx(y) = supx(z), which as I said is possible but very specific, since it requires z's right boundary to aligns exactly with y's left boundary.

And actually even in this case, if infx(y) = supx(z), then x is not the east of z, as that would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = supx(z). So infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). 

So, x cannot be SE of z.

Now, let me consider if x can be S:SW of z (a multi-tile relation):

For x to be S:SW of z, part of x is S of z and part of x is SW of z. This means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for the part that is SW of z.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) for the part that is S of z.

But wait, these requirements are contradictory. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means infx(x) ≤ infx(z). But for x to be S of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) ≤ infx(z).

Actually, let's remember that in the multi-tile model, a region can span multiple tiles. In this case, the requirements aren't for the entire region but for the subregions. So, it's possible for some part of x to be SW of z and some part to be S of z. 

Hmm, I realized I need to define the multi-tile model more carefully. In the multi-tile model, a region can span multiple tiles, but those tiles are relative to a fixed reference region. The tiles themselves are defined by the MBR of the reference region.

Given that y is S of z, y's center must be somewhere within the south tile, which means supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and its projection is horizontally contained within the projection of z. If x is SW of y, x's center must be in the SW tile of y.

However, the crucial question is: where is x relative to the tiles of z? 

Now, given that x is SW of y and y is S of z, and visualizing this, it's possible that:
- x is entirely SW of z, making the relation "SW".
- x is entirely S of z, making the relation "S".
- Part of x is SW of z and part is S of z, making the relation "SW:S".

In the multi-tile cardinal direction model, for a region to be "SW:S" of another, it would mean that if we were to divide the region into subregions, one subregion would be SW of the reference, and the other would be S of the reference. Since x is SW of y, and y is S of z, it's reasonable to think that x might intersect both the SW and S tiles relative to z, making the multi-tile relation "SW:S".

Let me reason a bit more carefully about this.

If the relation is SW:S, then part of region x is SW of region z and part of it is S of region z. This means that  the MBR of x overlaps both the SW tile and the S tile when z is taken as the reference region. 

Let's denote the part of x that is SW of z as x1, and the part that is S of z as x2.

For x1 to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x1) ≤ infx(z) (x1 is to the west of z)
- supy(x1) ≤ infy(z) (x1 is to the south of z)

For x2 to be S of z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x2) (x2's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary)
- supx(x2) ≤ supx(z) (x2's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)
- supy(x2) ≤ infy(z) (x2 is to the south of z)

But since x1 and x2 are parts of the same region x, x must be connected. This means the MBR of x overlaps both the SW and S tiles.

Now, can this happen given the  that x is SW of y and y is S of z? Let's reason step by step.

1. x is SW of y: x is both to the west and south of y.
2. y is S of z: y is to the south of z, with its horizontal projection contained within z's.

For a region x to overlap both the SW and S tiles of region z, its MBR would have to:
- Extend from the west of z into the region vertically below z.
- Be entirely to the south of z.

Given that x is to the west of y, and y's horizontal projection is contained within z's, it's possible for x to be positioned in a way that it overlaps both the SW and S tiles of z.

Here's a scenario where x is partly SW of z and partly S of z (a SW:S relation): Imagine x as a wide, horizontally-spread region. The left part of x is to the west and south of z (making it SW of z), and the right part of x is directly south of z (making it S of z).

In this configuration, the relation between x and z would be SW:S in the multi-tile model.

I think, based on the constraints we have, the possible relations are:
1. SW (if x is entirely to the west and south of z)
2. S (if x's horizontal projection is entirely contained within z's, and x is to the south of z)
3. SW:S (if part of x is to the west and south of z, and part of x is directly south of z)

But actually, a multi-tile relation is a particular type of relation, but it's not a single cardinal direction. In our case, we're trying to find out what 'could be the possible relations', and I believe the phrasing is referring to which single-tile cardinal directions are possible. In that case, the potential answers would be SW and S.

In conclusion, given that region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are SW and S.

Actually, let's be even more thorough here. We're trying to find the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z given that x is Southwest of y, and y is South of z.

Let's restate the definitions:

For x to be SW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For y to be S of z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)

Let's analyze all nine possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. SW:
   For x to be SW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

   We already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so the second condition is met. The first condition depends on the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). We know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). If infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z), making SW a possible relation. But if infx(z) < infx(y), the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) is unclear, and SW might not be a valid relation. By the definitions we were given, it's a possibility that x is SW of z, because it's possible that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, let's include this as a possibility.

2. S:
   For x to be S of z, we need:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)

   We already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so the first condition is met. The third condition is likely to be true, given:
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

   The second condition depends on the exact positioning of the regions. It's possible that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), making S a possible relation. So, let's include S as a possibility.

3. SE: I previously verified that SE is not possible.

4. W:
   For x to be W of z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom boundary is above or at z's bottom boundary)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is below or at z's top boundary)

   We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z), so the third condition is met. However, the second condition, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts the derived relation supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as this would imply infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is inconsistent with infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be W of z.

5. B:
   For x to be B of z, we need:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom boundary is above or at z's bottom boundary)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is below or at z's top boundary)
  
   The fourth condition is satisfied as we've shown: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z). The second condition is also likely to be true, as we've shown: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). However, the third condition, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts the derived relation supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as this would imply infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is inconsistent with infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

6. E:
   For x to be E of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom boundary is above or at z's bottom boundary)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is below or at z's top boundary)

   Again, the third condition is met. However, the second condition, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts the derived relation supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as this would imply infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which is inconsistent with infy(z) ≤ infy(x). Additionally, the first condition, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicts our derived relation:
   infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
   Which implies infx(x) ≤ supx(z), contradicting supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be E of z.

7. NW:
   For x to be NW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

   We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z). This contradicts the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be NW of z.

8. N:
   For x to be N of z, we need:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at z's left boundary)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)

   As shown in the NW case, the first condition, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicts our derived relation. So, x cannot be N of z.

9. NE:
   For x to be NE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

   Again, both conditions are contradicted by our derived relations. So, x cannot be NE of z.

So, after a thorough analysis of all nine single-tile cardinal direction relations, it's clear that the only possible relations between x and z are SW and S.

Actually, let's revisit the definition of the cardinal direction relations again. A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

In this definition, a cardinal direction relation can be a combination of single-tile relations. So, if a region x has parts that are SW of z and parts that are S of z, the relation can be represented as SW:S. 

Given this, the possible cardinal direction relations are:
1. SW (if x is entirely to the west and south of z)
2. S (if x's horizontal projection is entirely contained within z's, and x is to the south of z)
3. SW:S (if part of x is to the west and south of z, and part of x is directly south of z)

Actually I've previously shown that it's not possible for some parts of region x to be S of z and some parts to be SW of z. This is because:

For part of x to be S of z: infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
For part of x to be SW of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

Combining these: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
Which means infx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x), which implies that x is very specific, its left boundary and right boundary aligns exactly, which is unlikely.


Oh wait, wait. I see the issue. In my reasoning, I've been treating x as a single, cohesive region. But in the context of the multi-tile cardinal direction model, x can span multiple tiles. It's possible for PART of x to be SW of z and PART of x to be S of z.

For instance, if region x is shaped like:
```
   +-------+
   |       |
   |   x   |
   |       |
   +-------+
```

And region z is positioned as:
```
       +-------+
       |   z   |
       |       |
       +-------+
```

Then region x can have a part that's SW of z and a part that's S of z. The cardinal direction relation would be SW:S in this case.

So I think the possible cardinal direction relations are SW, S, and SW:S.

Actually, let me rectify a mistake in my reasoning. When I was checking if a multi-tile relation SW:S is possible, I was thinking in terms of individual points within the region, which is not correct. The multi-tile model divides the plane into 9 regions (tiles) based on the MBR of the reference region. If a region intersects with multiple tiles, it can have a multi-tile relation.

So, for a region to have a SW:S relation with another region, it would mean that it intersects with both the SW and S tiles of the reference region. 

Let's reconsider with the correct perspective. If x is SW of y and y is S of z, then x is below and to the left of y, and y is below z. It's possible for x to intersect both the SW and S tiles of z, making SW:S a possible relation.

In conclusion, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
1. SW (if x is strictly to the west and south of z)
2. S (if x is strictly to the south of z and horizontally within z)
3. SW:S (if x spans both the SW and S tiles relative to z)

Wait, I realize that there's ambiguity in using "to the west" and "to the south of". Let me double-check the definitions:

- An object is "to the south" (S) if it's below the Y-projection of the reference and horizontally contained in the X-projection of the reference.
- An object is "to the southwest" (SW) if it's below the Y-projection of the reference and to the left of the X-projection of the reference.

With these precise definitions, a region can't be BOTH S and SW of another, as they have mutually exclusive X-position requirements. It might have a part that's SW and another part that's S, resulting in a multi-tile relation SW:S.

But wait, I've been checking the multi-tile relationship. Since x is SW of y, it means ALL of x is to the southwest of y. It's not a multi-tile relation. Similarly, since y is S of z, ALL of y is to the south of z. 

Given this and what I previously showed, the cardinal direction relation for x relative to z can only be one of either SW, S in the context of this question. But let me double check the possible multi-tile SW:S relation.

So, the possible relations are:
1. SW (x is entirely to the west and south of z)
2. S (x's X-projection is entirely contained within z's X-projection, and x is to the south of z)
3. Possibly SW:S (if x spans both the SW and S regions relative to z)

But wait, I'm a bit confused about point 3. Let's try to see if it's possible for x to span both SW and S regions given the constraints. 

for  part of x to be SW of z and part of x to be S of z then the MBR of x crosses over from the S region to the SW region with respect to z.

Given that x is entirely SW of y, all points of x satisfy the condition that they are to the left of and below y's MBR. Given that y is entirely S of z, all points of y satisfy the condition that they are below z's MBR and horizontally contained within z's MBR.

For a part of x to be SW of z, it should be to the left of and below z's MBR. For a part of x to be S of z, it should be below z's MBR and horizontally contained within z's MBR.

Now, if x is entirely to the left of and below y, and y is entirely below z and horizontally contained within z, then x is constrained to be within the region that is to the left of z, below z, or to the left of and below z.

But the S region is below z and horizontally contained within z. For x to have a part within the S region, it would need to have a part that is horizontally contained within z's MBR, which might contradict the condition that x is entirely to the left of y, which is horizontally contained within z.

Actually let's illustrate this with a diagram:

If y is S of z and x is SW of y, we might have a configuration like:

```
  +-------+
  |   z   |
  +-------+
      |
  +-------+
  |   y   |
  +-------+
  /
+-------+
|   x   |
+-------+
```

In this simple diagram, x is SW of y, and y is S of z. But relative to z, x might be strictly SW of z.

But another valid configuration could be:

```
  +-------+
  |   z   |
  +-------+
      |
  +-------+
  |   y   |
  +-------+
      /
+-------+
|   x   |
+-------+
```

In this configuration, x is SW of y, and y is S of z. But relative to z, x is primarily SW of z, but it could have a part that's horizontally contained within z's projection, making it span both the SW and S tiles relative to z. This would mean SW:S is a valid multi-tile relation.

And for completeness, a third valid configuration could be:
```
  +-------+
  |   z   |
  +-------+
      |
  +-------+
  |   y   |
  +-------+
         /
    +-------+
    |   x   |
    +-------+
```

In this configuration, x is SW of y, and y is S of z. Relative to z, x is strictly S of z (horizontally contained within z's projection).

Given these configurations, my previous conclusion that the possible relations are SW, S, and SW:S seems robust when looking at specific configurations

Now let's double check our answer.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is S of region z

After careful analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
1. SW (if x is entirely to the west and south of z)
2. S (if x is entirely to the south of z and horizontally within z's projection)
3. SW:S (if x spans both the SW and S tiles relative to z)

I think this covers all possibilities in the context of the problem. Configurations 1, 2, and 3 shown in the diagrams provide specific examples of how x can relate to z in these ways.

Actually wait, now that I look at my diagrams more, I'm not sure if SW:S is possible. The constraints are:

For x to be SW of y:
- All points of x must be to the west and south of all points of y.

For y to be S of z:
- All points of y must be to the south of all points of z.
- All points of y must be horizontally contained within z's projection.

If y is horizontally contained within z, then all points of y have x-coordinates that are within the range of z's x-coordinates. If x is west of y, then all points of x have x-coordinates that are less than the smallest x-coordinate of y, which is also within z's range. This would put x to the west of at least part of z.

But for x to have a part that's S of z (and not SW), it would need to have a part that's horizontally contained within z's projection. If y is horizontally contained within z, and x is entirely to the west of y, then x can't have a part that's horizontally contained within z's projection, making SW:S not a valid relation.

Wait, but me re-think this.

For x to be S of z, its x-coordinates need to be within the range of z's x-coordinates. For x to be SW of y, its x-coordinates need to be less than the smallest x-coordinate of y. If y's x-coordinates are entirely within the range of z's x-coordinates, then for x to be both SW of y and have a part that's S of z, y's smallest x-coordinate would need to be at the lower end of z's x-coordinate range. 

Actually I think diagram 3 is incorrect. In that diagram, x is not SW of y; it's S of y. Let me re-draw:

```
   +-------+
   |   z   |
   +-------+
       |
   +---+---+
   | y |   |
   +---+---+
    /
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

Now, y is S of z (it's below z and horizontally contained within z), and x is SW of y (it's to the west and south of y). Relative to z, x is SW of z.

Now let's consider a configuration where x might have a part that's S of z:

```
   +-------+
   |   z   |
   +-------+
       |
   +---+
   | y |
   +---+
    /
+---+---+
| x |   |
+---+---+
```

In this diagram, x is still SW of y (it's to the west and south of y), and y is S of z (it's below z and horizontally contained within z). But now, x extends to the right such that it's also horizontally contained within z, making it have a part that's S of z. This would make the relation between x and z, SW:S.

So, I think SW:S is a valid multi-tile relation given the constraints.

Hence, the possible cardinal direction relations are SW, S, and SW:S.

But I still don't think SW:S is possible.

Let's reconsider. For x to have a part that's S of z, that part of x needs to be horizontally contained within z. If y is S of z, then y is horizontally contained within z. If x is SW of y, all of x is to the west of all of y. Since y is horizontally contained within z, and x is to the west of y, x must be to the west of at least some part of z. This would put all of x to the west or southwest of z, never directly south.

So I think the diagram where x spans both the southwest and south is problematic.

However, if the horizontal containment criterion for S is not so strict, you could have a scenario where y is almost at the left side of z, and x extends to the right such that it's horizontally contained within z. But I think this is not in line with a strict interpretation of the definitions.

Upon careful reconsideration, I now think the possible cardinal direction relations are just SW and S, not including SW:S.

But wait, even if x is to the west of y, and y is horizontally within the projection of z, it's still possible for a part of x to be horizontally within the projection of z. For example, if z is very wide horizontally and y is at the far left corner of z, and x is to the left of and below y, but x is also wide horizontally, then it might stretch rightwards into the horizontal projection of z.

Ok actually let me draw a final concrete diagram:

```
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0
1     +-------+
2     |   z   |
3     +-------+
4       |
5     +-+
6     |y|
7     +-+
8      /
9   +---+
10  | x |
11  +---+
```

Here, y is at the vertical projection of the left half of z (so it's S of z), and x is to the southwest of y. Relative to z, x is SW of z. It's not horizontally contained within z, so it can't be S of z or have a part that's S of z.

But now, let's modify the diagram to allow for SW:S:

```
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0
1     +-------+
2     |   z   |
3     +-------+
4       |
5     +-+
6     |y|
7     +-+
8      /
9   +-----+
10  |  x   |
11  +-----+
```

Now, x extends to the right such that it's horizontally contained within z, which would make it have a part that's S of z. But wait, I think this doesn't satify the constraint that x is SW of y. 

Actually, no, x is still SW of y, as all points of x are to the west and south of all points of y. It's just that some points of x are also horizontally contained within z, making them S of z rather than SW of z.

So I think the possible cardinal direction relations are indeed SW, S, and SW:S.

Actually, let's resolve this by using the formal definitions directly. A region a is SW of a region b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).

From our constraints:
- Region x is SW of region y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- Region y is S of region z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

I've already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x is to the south of z.

Now, for the horizontal positioning:
- I know that infx(z) ≤ infx(y), but I don't know the exact relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is SW of z. If infx(z) < supx(x), then at least a part of x is horizontally contained within z.

For x to be S of z, I need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But I don't know the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x). If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x can be S of z.

For x to have a multi-tile relation SW:S with z, part of x would be SW of z, and part of it would be S of z. For a region to have a multi-tile relation, it should just intersect with multiple tiles in the plane defined relative to the reference.

I think part of the way I'm getting confused is that I was think x, y, and z are just singletons.

Given the formal definitions and the constraints, I can't rule out any of the relations SW, S, or SW:S. They all depend on the exact relative positions of the regions.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are SW, S, and SW:S.

Actually, I don't think I can claim SW:S is possible without a concrete example. Let me try to construct one:

Let's define regions x, y, and z through their minimum bounding rectangles:
- Region z: [infx(z) = 3, supx(z) = 8, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3]
- Region y: [infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 5, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 7]
- Region x: [infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 9, supy(x) = 11]

With these coordinates:
- y is S of z, since supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (7 ≤ 1? No, this is incorrect, it's the y-coordinate, so 7 > 1, so this property is incorrect). 

Sorry, I made a mistake. Let me redefine the regions with respect to the formal definitions:
- Region z: [infx(z) = 3, supx(z) = 8, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3]
- Region y: [infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 5, infy(y) = 4, supy(y) = 5]
- Region x: [infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 7, supy(x) = 9]

With these coordinates:
- y is S of z, since supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (5 > 1, so this property is incorrect again). 

Sorry, I made another mistake regarding the interpretation of "S". Let's get this right. For y to be S of z, it's supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (which means y is below z), and not the other way around. So, if y is S of z, it means y is to the south of z.

Let me define the regions once again, with the correct interpretation:
- Region z: [infx(z) = 3, supx(z) = 8, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3]
- Region y: [infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 7, infy(y) = -3, supy(y) = 0]
- Region x: [infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 6, infy(x) = -6, supy(x) = -4]

Now, with these coordinates:
- y is S of z, since:
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (0 ≤ 1) ✓
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (3 ≤ 4) ✓
  - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (7 ≤ 8) ✓

- x is SW of y, since:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (6 > 4, so this property is incorrect).

Let me adjust region x with the correct interpretation:
- Region x: [infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = -6, supy(x) = -4]

Now, x is SW of y, since:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (3 ≤ 4) ✓
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (-4 ≤ -3) ✓
