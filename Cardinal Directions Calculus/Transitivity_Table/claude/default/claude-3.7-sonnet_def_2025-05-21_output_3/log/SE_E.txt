PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

In this problem, we are given that:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is E of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's apply the definitions from the given information.

First, let's write down what x SE y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

And y E z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's lower y-bound is at least as high as z's lower y-bound)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's upper y-bound is at most as high as z's upper y-bound)

Now, let's try to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From x SE y and y E z, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (since x is to the east of y, and y is to the east of z)

This implies that x is to the east of z. So the possible relations could include E, NE, or SE.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)

We can't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z) from these constraints. So we need to consider multiple possibilities.

Let's examine all nine possible cardinal directions and see which ones are compatible with our constraints:

1. x N z:
   - This requires supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - But we know supy(x) <= infy(y), which means x is below y
   - And from y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which places z's y-range at least as large as y's
   - So, x is below y, and z's y-range includes y's, which means it's unlikely that x is north of z
   - Actually, we can be more precise. If supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (z can go as low as y), then it's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z) doesn't hold, which means x N z isn't guaranteed.

2. x NE z:
   - This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - The first condition is satisfied (as derived above)
   - But again, we can't guarantee that supy(z) <= infy(x), for the same reason as in the N case
   - So, x NE z isn't guaranteed. But is it possible? 
   - Well, if supy(z) is high enough, and infy(x) is also high enough, then yes, it's possible

3. x E z:
   - This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - The first condition is satisfied
   - For the second, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z), but we can't directly compare infy(y) and infy(x)
   - For the third, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y), and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
   - So, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - But the second condition still isn't guaranteed
   - If infy(z) <= infy(x), then x E z is possible

4. x SE z:
   - This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - The first condition is satisfied
   - For the second, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y), but we can't directly compare infy(y) and infy(z)
   - From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - So, it's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), but not guaranteed
   - If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x SE z is possible

5. x S z:
   - This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - For the first, as in the SE case, it's possible if supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - For the second, we have supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
   - So, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This means that x is to the east of z, not to the west or directly above/below.
   - This contradicts the requirement for x S z, which needs x to be directly below z.
   - Therefore, x S z is not possible.

6. x SW z:
   - This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From our derivation, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the first requirement
   - Therefore, x SW z is not possible.

7. x W z:
   - This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - As in the SW case, this contradicts our derivation
   - Therefore, x W z is not possible.

8. x NW z:
   - This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - Again, this contradicts our derivation
   - Therefore, x NW z is not possible.

9. x B z:
   - This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From our derivation, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the second requirement
   - Therefore, x B z is not possible.

Ok going back. I think I might have been a bit sloppy in my reasoning. Let me carefully go through this step by step.

From x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's lower y-bound is at least as high as z's lower y-bound)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's upper y-bound is at most as high as z's upper y-bound)

Now, let's derive the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- Combining these, we get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- This means: supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies that x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

From the info, we can say that if the upper y-bound of x is below the lower y-bound of y, and the lower y-bound of z can go as low as the lower y-bound of y, we can have three scenarios:
1. The upper y-bound of x is below the lower y-bound of z.
2. The y-range of x overlaps with the y-range of z.
3. The y-range of x is entirely within the y-range of z.
4. The lower y-bound of x is above the upper y-bound of z.

For scenario 1, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z. Combined with x being to the east of z, this implies x SE z.

For scenario 2 and 3, x is to the east of z, but neither to the north nor to the south. This implies x E z.

For scenario 4, infy(x) >= supy(z), which means x is to the north of z. Combined with x being to the east of z, this implies x NE z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: SE, E, and NE.

But I'm still not completely confident. Let me verify this once more.

Let me think about the problem more carefully. I have regions x, y, and z, with the following constraints:
- x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's derive the constraints for the possible relations between x and z.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- Combining these, we get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- This means: supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies that x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

Given these constraints, let's reason about the possible relations:

For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). From the constraints, we know supy(y) <= supy(z). So, if infy(x) > supy(y), then infy(x) > supy(y) <= supy(z), and it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x), making N a possibility. However, from x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y), which means x is to the south of y. If x is to the south of y and y's y-range is within z's y-range, it's unlikely that x would be to the north of z. So, x N z is not a likely possibility.

Let's try to draw up some coordinates to better understand the constraints. 

Let's say y's coordinates are boxed by (1, 1) to (2, 2). This means infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 2, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 2.

Given x SE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y). So, infx(x) >= 2 and supy(x) <= 1. Let's set x's coordinates as boxed by (3, 0) to (4, 1).

Given y E z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z). So, supx(z) <= 1, infy(z) <= 1, and supy(z) >= 2. Let's set z's coordinates as boxed by (-1, 0) to (1, 3).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is at (3, 0) to (4, 1)
- z is at (-1, 0) to (1, 3)
- Checking x-coordinate: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 3, so x is to the east of z.
- Checking y-coordinate: We have overlap. The y-range of x is [0, 1] and the y-range of z is [0, 3].

So, given these specific coordinates, the relation between x and z would be E.

But let's try another set of coordinates to see if SE or NE are also possible.

Let's keep y the same, but change x to be (3, -1) to (4, 0). And let's set z to be (-1, 1) to (1, 3).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is at (3, -1) to (4, 0)
- z is at (-1, 1) to (1, 3)
- Checking x-coordinate: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 3, so x is to the east of z.
- Checking y-coordinate: supy(x) = 0 <= infy(z) = 1, so x is to the south of z.

Given these coordinates, the relation between x and z would be SE.

Let's try one more set for NE. Let's keep y the same, but change x to be (3, 3) to (4, 4). And let's set z to be (-1, 0) to (1, 2).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is at (3, 3) to (4, 4)
- z is at (-1, 0) to (1, 2)
- Checking x-coordinate: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 3, so x is to the east of z.
- Checking y-coordinate: supy(z) = 2 <= infy(x) = 3, so x is to the north of z.

Given these coordinates, the relation between x and z would be NE.

So, based on the constraints and the examples we've drawn up, the possible relations between x and z are E, SE, and NE.

Actually, I'm noticing a mistake in my first analysis. I prematurely ruled out x N z by reasoning that if x is to the south of y, and y's y-range is within z's y-range, then x wouldn't be to the north of z. But this reasoning isn't correct. The constraint supy(x) <= infy(y) only tells us that x is below y, but it doesn't tell us exactly how far below. If x is just slightly below y and z's y-range is much larger, it's possible for x to be to the north of z.

Let me try to draw up an example for x N z.

Let's say y's coordinates are boxed by (1, 5) to (2, 6). This means infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 2, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 6.

Given x SE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y). So, infx(x) >= 2 and supy(x) <= 5. Let's set x's coordinates as boxed by (3, 3) to (4, 5).

Given y E z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z). So, supx(z) <= 1, infy(z) <= 5, and supy(z) >= 6. Let's set z's coordinates as boxed by (-1, 0) to (1, 7).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is at (3, 3) to (4, 5)
- z is at (-1, 0) to (1, 7)
- Checking x-coordinate: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 3, so x is to the east of z.
- Checking y-coordinate: Neither is strictly to the north or south. The y-range of x is [3, 5] and the y-range of z is [0, 7], which means x's y-range is entirely within z's y-range.

Given these coordinates, the relation between x and z would still be E.

But I'm also noticing that I haven't tested for S. Let me try that.

Let's keep y's coordinates as boxed by (1, 5) to (2, 6).

Given x SE y, let's set x's coordinates as boxed by (3, 0) to (4, 5).

Given y E z, let's set z's coordinates as boxed by (-1, 6) to (1, 8).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is at (3, 0) to (4, 5)
- z is at (-1, 6) to (1, 8)
- Checking x-coordinate: supx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 3, so x is to the east of z.
- Checking y-coordinate: supy(x) = 5 <= infy(z) = 6, so x is to the south of z.

Oops, actually this is SE, not S. For S, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), meaning x is directly below z. But from our derivation, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z, contradicting the requirement for x S z. So, S is not a possible relation.

Let me try to check if x SE z is possible using another example. Let's redefine the regions.

Let y be boxed by (10, 10) to (15, 15). This means infx(y) = 10, supx(y) = 15, infy(y) = 10, supy(y) = 15.

Given x SE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y). So, infx(x) >= 15 and supy(x) <= 10. Let's set x to be boxed by (15, 0) to (20, 10).

Given y E z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z). So, supx(z) <= 10, infy(z) <= 10, and supy(z) >= 15. Let's set z to be boxed by (0, 0) to (10, 20).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is at (15, 0) to (20, 10)
- z is at (0, 0) to (10, 20)
- Checking x-coordinate: supx(z) = 10 <= infx(x) = 15, so x is to the east of z.
- Checking y-coordinate: The y-range of x is [0, 10] and the y-range of z is [0, 20]. x's y-range is entirely within z's y-range.

So, the relation is E.

Let's try one more time. Let y be boxed by (10, 10) to (15, 15).

Given x SE y, let's set x to be boxed by (15, 5) to (20, 10).

Given y E z, let's set z to be boxed by (0, 15) to (10, 20).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is at (15, 5) to (20, 10)
- z is at (0, 15) to (10, 20)
- Checking x-coordinate: supx(z) = 10 <= infx(x) = 15, so x is to the east of z.
- Checking y-coordinate: supy(x) = 10 <= infy(z) = 15, so x is to the south of z.

So, the relation is SE.

Let's do one more for NE. Let y be boxed by (10, 10) to (15, 15).

Given x SE y, let's set x to be boxed by (15, 5) to (20, 10).

Given y E z, let's set z to be boxed by (0, 0) to (10, 5).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is at (15, 5) to (20, 10)
- z is at (0, 0) to (10, 5)
- Checking x-coordinate: supx(z) = 10 <= infx(x) = 15, so x is to the east of z.
- Checking y-coordinate: supy(z) = 5 <= infy(x) = 5, with equality here, which means x is to the north of z (or at the same level).

So, the relation is NE (since the condition for NE is that supy(z) <= infy(x), which holds here).

Let's also check for S.

Let y be boxed by (10, 10) to (15, 15).

Given x SE y, let's set x to be boxed by (10, 5) to (15, 10).

Wait, this doesn't satisfy x SE y. For x SE y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x), which means 15 <= infx(x). Let's adjust.

Let x be boxed by (15, 5) to (20, 10).

Given y E z, let's set z to be boxed by (0, 15) to (20, 20).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is at (15, 5) to (20, 10)
- z is at (0, 15) to (20, 20)
- Checking x-coordinate: The x-range of x is [15, 20] and the x-range of z is [0, 20]. x's x-range is entirely within z's x-range, but they're not equal.
- Checking y-coordinate: supy(x) = 10 <= infy(z) = 15, so x is to the south of z.

Since x's x-range is entirely within z's x-range but not equal to it, and x is to the south of z, the relation is not S. Actually, wait, for S, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The second condition says that the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of z. This doesn't align with our derivation that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means the entirety of x is strictly to the east of z. So, S is not a possible relation.

Oh wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clearly state the constraints for S. For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z)

In other words, x is directly below z, and x's width should not exceed z's width when we regard regions in a grid-like manner.

From our derivation, we have supx(z) <= infx(x). This means the right edge of z is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of x. In other words, x is entirely to the east of z. This contradicts the conditions for x S z, since for S, x should be directly below z, not to the east. So, S is not a possible relation.

Let me verify the other directions as well.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

From our derivation, we have supx(z) <= infx(x). This means infx(x) >= supx(z), so supx(x) > supx(z) (unless x has zero width). This contradicts the condition for SW, which requires supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x SW z is not a possible relation.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or at the same position as the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or at the same position as the top edge of z)

Again, from our derivation, we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition for W. So, x W z is not a possible relation.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

Again, from our derivation, the first condition is contradicted. So, x NW z is not a possible relation.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z)

From our derivation, we have supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) < supx(x) (because regions have positive width), we have supx(z) < supx(x), which contradicts the third condition for N. So, x N z is not a possible relation.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or at the same position as the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or at the same position as the top edge of z)

From our derivation, we have supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) < supx(x) (because regions have positive width), we have supx(z) < supx(x), which contradicts the second condition for B. So, x B z is not a possible relation.

So, based on our analysis, the possible relations between x and z are E, SE, and NE.

Actually, I notice that we can make x SE:E of z, i.e., x spans the SE and E tiles of z. Similarly, we can have x NE:E of z, or even x NE:E:SE of z.

However, the question is asking for the basic cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B). We've established that the possible relations are E, SE, and NE. We can also have combinations like SE:E, NE:E, or NE:E:SE, but those are not listed as options. So, the answer is the 3 single-tile relations: E, SE, and NE.

Actually, let's verify one more time by checking all 9 single-tile cardinal directions to make sure my reasoning was correct.

The constraints from the problem:
- x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we derived the constraint for the x-coordinate: supx(z) <= infx(x), which means that x is to the east of z.

Now, if x is strictly to the east of z, it can only have the relations E, NE, or SE with z, depending on the y-coordinate relationship. It cannot have the relations N, NW, W, SW, S, or B with z.

Let's check each of the nine single-tile cardinal directions:

1. x N z:
   - This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - From our derivation, we have supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - Since regions have positive width, infx(x) < supx(x), so supx(z) < supx(x)
   - This contradicts the third requirement for N, which needs supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - So, x N z is not possible.

2. x NE z:
   - This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - The first condition is what we derived from the constraints, so it's satisfied
   - For the second condition, we have:
     - supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
     - infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
     - supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
   - We can't directly determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) from these
   - But it's a possibility, especially if z is more to the south or x is more to the north
   - So, x NE z is possible.

3. x E z:
   - This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - The first condition is satisfied
   - For the second and third, similar to the NE case, we can't directly determine them from the constraints
   - But they are both possible, depending on the exact positions of x and z
   - So, x E z is possible.

4. x SE z:
   - This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - The first condition is satisfied
   - For the second, we have:
     - supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
     - infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
   - This means supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but it doesn't tell us the direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z)
   - It's possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) if infy(z) is close or equal to infy(y)
   - So, x SE z is possible.

5. x S z:
   - This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - From our derivation, we have supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - Since regions have positive width, infx(x) < supx(x), so supx(z) < supx(x)
   - This contradicts the third requirement for S, which needs supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - So, x S z is not possible.

6. x SW z:
   - This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - From our derivation, we have supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - Since regions have positive width, supx(x) > infx(x), so supx(x) > supx(z)
   - This means supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible
   - So, x SW z is not possible.

7. x W z:
   - This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - As in the SW case, the first condition is not possible
   - So, x W z is not possible.

8. x NW z:
   - This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - As in the SW case, the first condition is not possible
   - So, x NW z is not possible.

9. x B z:
   - This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - From our derivation, we have supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - Since regions have positive width, supx(x) > infx(x), so supx(x) > supx(z)
   - This contradicts the second requirement for B, which needs supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - So, x B z is not possible.

Based on this detailed check, we've confirmed that the only possible single-tile cardinal directions for the relation between x and z are E, NE, and SE. The other six directions are not possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are: E, NE, and SE.

Actually, let me try to take the analysis a bit further. 

From x SE y and y E z, I've established that x is to the east of z. For the y-axis, there are three possibilities:
- x is to the north of z (NE)
- x and z overlap in the y-axis (E)
- x is to the south of z (SE)

To determine which of these is possible, I'll try to check if there's a logical deduction I can make from the given constraints.

For x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). This means x is below y.
For y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means the y-range of y is contained in the y-range of z.

Given that x is below y and the y-range of y is contained in the y-range of z, it seems like x could be below z, overlapping with z, or even above z, depending on the exact positions.

So i think my final answer is correct, which is that the possible relations between region x and region z are: E, NE, and SE.

ANSWER:

The given conditions are:
- x SE y
- y E z

To determine the possible relations between x and z, I need to analyze the constraints these conditions impose.

From x SE y:
- x is to the east of y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- x is to the south of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

From y E z:
- y is to the east of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- y's y-range is within z's y-range: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- This means x must be to the east of z

For the y-coordinate relationship, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z's y-range includes y's)

Based on these constraints, x could be:
- To the south of z (SE relation)
- Neither north nor south of z (E relation)
- To the north of z (NE relation)

The possible relations are: E, SE, NE
