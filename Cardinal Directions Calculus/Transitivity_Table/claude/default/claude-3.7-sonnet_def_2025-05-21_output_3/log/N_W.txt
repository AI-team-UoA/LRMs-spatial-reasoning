PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We know that:
1. x is N of y (or, x N y)
2. y is W of z (or, y W z)

We want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Let's recall the definitions of the cardinal direction relations N and W:

- x N y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
  (This means x is entirely above y's bounding box, and the x-projection of x falls within the x-projection of y)

- y W z if and only if supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
  (This means y is entirely to the left of z's bounding box, and the y-projection of y falls within the y-projection of z)

Now, let's analyze what we can infer about the relationship between x and z.

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (bottom edge of y is above or at the same height as the bottom edge of z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (top edge of y is below or at the same height as the top edge of z)

Now, let's see what we can derive about the relationship between x and z.

From x N y and y W z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y: x is above y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z: top edge of y is below or at the same height as the top edge of z)

This doesn't directly tell us if x is above z, so we can't conclusively say if x is N of z.

From x N y and y W z, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y: left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y: right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z: y is to the left of z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
- This implies supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

But we still need to consider the y-coordinates.

From x N y and y W z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y: x is above y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z: bottom edge of y is above or at the same height as the bottom edge of z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z: top edge of y is below or at the same height as the top edge of z)

I can't immediately derive a direct relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z from these.

Let's look at some specific cases to get a clearer picture.

Imagine that x, y, and z are all squares with the same size. If x is directly north of y, and y is directly west of z, then x would be in the northwest position relative to z. This would be denoted as x NW z.

But there could be other cases. 

If x is not directly above y, but slightly to the left or right (but still within the N relation), and y is directly to the left of z, then x might still be northwest of z (x NW z) or potentially north of z (x N z).

On the other hand, if x is directly above y, but y is not directly to the left of z (but still within the W relation), then x could be northwest of z (x NW z) or potentially west of z (x W z).

Let's re-examine what we've derived so far.

From the constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

For x to be N of z, we would need: supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
But we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

For x to be W of z, we would need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've derived supx(x) <= infx(z). But we don't have clear constraints on infy(z) relative to infy(x) or supy(x) relative to supy(z).

Let's try to see if there's a constraint from the given relations. From x N y and y W z:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (bottom edge of y is above or at the same height as the bottom edge of z)

Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x).

From x N y and y W z:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (top edge of y is below or at the same height as the top edge of z)

This doesn't directly give us a constraint on supy(x) relative to supy(z). But if we consider the fact that x is above y, and the top edge of y is at or below the top edge of z, it's possible for x to be above z, below z, or partially overlapping with z in terms of the y-coordinate.

Actually, I think we need to be more careful in our analysis. The cardinal relations N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW are mutually exclusive, meaning a region can only be in one of these relations with respect to another region. 

Let's try a different approach. We'll use the bounding box representation.

Region y divides the 2D space into 9 tiles: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE.
x is in the N tile of y.
z is in the E tile of y.

Now, we need to figure out the possible tiles of z where x can be.

Let's look at the definitions more carefully:

- x N y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y W z if and only if supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From x N y, we can say:
- x is entirely above y's bounding box.
- The x-projection of x falls within the x-projection of y.

From y W z, we can say:
- y is entirely to the left of z's bounding box.
- The y-projection of y falls within the y-projection of z.

Visually, y's bounding box has z to its east and x to its north. Let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z.

Combining the constraints from x N y and y W z:

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (bottom edge of y is above or at the same height as the bottom edge of z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (top edge of y is below or at the same height as the top edge of z)

Let's derive the constraints on the relationship between x and z.

For the x-coordinates:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
- This implies supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z in the x-coordinate.

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
- This implies infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the bottom edge of x is above or at the same height as the bottom edge of z.

Also, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z)

But this doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

Let's see what we know for sure about the relationship between x and z:
- x is to the left of z in the x-coordinate.
- The bottom edge of x is above or at the same height as the bottom edge of z.

For x to be NW of z, we'd need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We've derived supx(x) <= infx(z). 

For the y-coordinate, we've derived infy(z) <= infy(x). But for x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). Given our current derivations, this condition might or might not be satisfied.

Actually, if the top of y is at the same height as the top of z (i.e., supy(y) = supy(z)), then from supy(y) <= infy(x), we'd have supy(z) <= infy(x), which would place x in the NW of z.

But if the top of z is higher than the top of y (i.e., supy(y) < supy(z)), then we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). In this case, x could potentially be W or NW of z, depending on the specific positions.

Wait, let's think about this more carefully. From x N y, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), which is sort of saying that the "width" of the x-projection of x is at most the "width" of the x-projection of y. And the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y. 

But there's another key constraint: x is entirely above y (supy(y) <= infy(x)). This means that y and x don't overlap in the y-coordinate. Meanwhile, y is entirely to the left of z (supx(y) <= infx(z)), so y and z don't overlap in the x-coordinate.

Given these non-overlaps in one dimension each, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z. If we draw this out:

y is to the left and z is to the right (on the x-axis). 
x is above y (on the y-axis).

Given that the x-projections of x falls within the x-projection of y, and y is entirely to the left of z, x must also be to the left of z. This means x can be W, NW, or SW of z.

Given that x is above y, and the y-projection of y falls within the y-projection of z, x can be above, at the same level, or below z, depending on the specific positions.

Ok I think I'm making this too complicated. The crux of it is if we look at the cardinal relations that can happen between x and z.

If x is N of y, then the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y. And if y is W of z, then y is entirely to the left of z. This means x must also be entirely to the left of z. So, x can only be in the tiles W, NW, or SW relative to z. Since we know that x is N of y, and y is W of z, intuitively it feels like NW is the "default" relation between x and z, but depending on the specific positions, x can also be W or SW of z.

Hm, actually I think I was overthinking this as the constraints do provide definitive relations.

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (1)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (2)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (3)

From y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (4)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (5)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (6)

Let's find the relation between x and z:

For the x-coordinate:
Combining (3) and (4), we get supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is strictly to the left of z. So, x can be W, NW, or SW of z.

For the y-coordinate:
Combining (1) and (5), we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
Simplifying, we get infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z. 

We don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between the top edge of x and the top edge of z or the bottom edge of x and the top edge of z.

So, let me look at the definitions again to determine which of W, NW, or SW could be the relation between x and z.

For x to be W of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (this is satisfied) AND
infy(z) <= infy(x) (this is satisfied) AND
supy(x) <= supy(z)

We don't know if supy(x) <= supy(z) for sure, but it's possible. So, W is a possible relation.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (this is satisfied) AND
supy(z) <= infy(x)

We don't know if supy(z) <= infy(x) for sure, but it's possible. So, NW is also a possible relation.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (this is satisfied) AND
supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (since supy(x) is greater than or equal to infy(x)). So, SW is NOT a possible relation.

Hence, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are W and NW.

Wait, let's re-examine this carefully. We have:

For x to be SW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (this is satisfied) AND
supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which means infy(x) >= infy(z). But for x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). If supy(x) <= infy(x) (which is always the case), and infy(x) >= infy(z), then it doesn't necessarily mean supy(x) <= infy(z). It all depends on the relative positions.

In fact, the way we've set up the cardinal direction relations, a region can't be N and W of another region at the same time. It's one or the other, or NW.

But actually I think there's a flaw in my logic. Let's look at the definition of SW again. For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x is entirely below and to the left of z's bounding box.

We've derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z. Given this, x can't be entirely below z's bounding box. So, SW is indeed NOT a possible relation between x and z, based on the constraints we have.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are W and NW.

Actually, let's double check that more carefully.

For x to be W of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (this is satisfied) AND
infy(z) <= infy(x) (this is satisfied) AND
supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've derived that supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x). But we don't have a direct constraint on supy(x) relative to supy(z). Given the constraints, it's possible for x to be W of z if supy(x) <= supy(z), but there's also a possibility where supy(x) > supy(z), in which case x wouldn't be W of z.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (this is satisfied) AND
supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've derived that supx(x) <= infx(z), but we don't have a direct constraint on supy(z) relative to infy(x). Given the constraints, it's possible for x to be NW of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), but there's also a possibility where supy(z) > infy(x), in which case x wouldn't be NW of z.

For x to be N of z, we need:
supy(z) <= infy(x) (uncertain based on the given constraints) AND
infx(z) <= infx(x) AND
supx(x) <= supx(z)

But we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (this is satisfied) AND
supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've derived infy(z) <= infy(x). Given that supy(x) >= infy(x) (by definition of a region's bounds), we have supy(x) >= infy(x) >= infy(z). This doesn't match the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be SW of z. So, x cannot be SW of z.

Similarly, we can check the other cardinal directions and determine that x cannot be NE, E, SE, S, or B of z based on the derived constraints.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are W and NW, not SW like I originally incorrectly thought.

But let's think about this more carefully. We're working under the assumption that the x and y projections of regions are non-empty intervals. But could there be a case where supy(y) = infy(x) or infy(z) = infy(y)?

Actually let's focus on the constraints that we only need.

From what we've derived, if x is NW of z, then:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already satisfied)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) 

From the given constraints, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y W z)

These don't directly imply supy(z) <= infy(x). In fact, if supy(y) < supy(z), then we can't say for sure if supy(z) <= infy(x). So, NW is possible, but not guaranteed.

Similarly, for x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (already satisfied)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (already satisfied)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've already derived infy(z) <= infy(x). But we don't have a direct constraint on supy(x) relative to supy(z). So, W is also possible, but not guaranteed.

Hmm, let's try again from another angle. 

I'll work with the bounding box representation of regions and the tile-based cardinal direction relation model. In this model, the 2D space is divided into 9 tiles centered on the reference region's bounding box.

First, let's remind ourselves that a region might be in more than one of this 9 tiles. The cardinal direction relation between region a and region b is denoted by the list of tiles of b where a has parts of its boundaries.

If x is N of y, this means:
- x is above y.
- The x-projection of x falls within the x-projection of y.

If y is W of z, this means:
- y is to the left of z.
- The y-projection of y falls within the y-projection of z.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to look at the possible positions of x relative to z.

But actually I think I'm overthinking this. The problem is actually quite simple. Based on the given definitions, if x is entirely N of region y, and y is entirely W of region z, then where could x possibly be relative to z?

From x N y, we know that x is entirely above y, and x is bounded horizontally by y (meaning x's width is at most y's width and it's centered above y). 

From y W z, we know that y is entirely to the left of z, and y is bounded vertically by z (meaning y's height is at most z's height and it's centered to the left of z).

Combining these, x is above y and y is to the left of z. So, x is to the left of z, and it's either entirely above, partially above, at the same level, or even below z (all depending on the specific positions). So x is in one of the directions: NW, W, SW. 

But wait, we need to use the formal definitions to be sure.

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (1)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (2)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (3)

From y W z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (4)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (5)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (6)

From (1) and (6), we get:
supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
Can we derive a relationship between infy(x) and supy(z)? Not directly. It's possible that infy(x) >= supy(z) or infy(x) < supy(z). So, x could be entirely above, partially above, or not above z.

From (3) and (4), we get:
supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
This implies supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z.

From (2), (3), and (4), we get:
infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
This means infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which further confirms that x is to the left of z.

From (1) and (5), we get:
supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
We don't have a direct relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) from these.

Given the derivation that x is entirely to the left of z and its y-coordinate relationship with z is uncertain, x could be in one of these directions: NW, W, or SW. However, we need to check each one to confirm.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (already satisfied) AND
supy(z) <= infy(x)

We have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), but this doesn't directly imply supy(z) <= infy(x). So, NW is possible but not guaranteed.

Wait, let me re-examine. For x to be NW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (constraint 1)
supy(z) <= infy(x) (constraint 2)

We've derived that supx(x) <= infx(z) from the given constraints. But we don't have a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). Let me re-read the formal definition of NW. 

For a NW b, we need supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a). 

Applying this to our case, for x NW z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) (which is satisfied) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (which might or might not be satisfied based on our current constraints). So, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

For x to be W of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (constraint 1, already satisfied)
infy(z) <= infy(x) (constraint 2)
supy(x) <= supy(z) (constraint 3)

We've derived that supx(x) <= infx(z) from the given constraints. 

Now, from the given constraints, we have:
infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y W z)
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)

We don't directly derive infy(z) <= infy(x), but it's a possibility. Similarly, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(z). So, W is also a possible relation between x and z.

But wait, I messed up. From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we can derive:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
This gives us infy(z) <= infy(x), which is constraint 2 for x W z. So, this constraint is satisfied.

For constraint 3, we still don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

For x to be SW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (constraint 1, already satisfied)
supy(x) <= infy(z) (constraint 2)

We've derived that supx(x) <= infx(z) from the given constraints. But we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). But since we have derived infy(z) <= infy(x), we can infer that supy(x) might or might not be <= infy(z). Actually, let's think about this: All regions have the property that infy(region) <= supy(region). For our case, infy(x) <= supy(x). And we derived infy(z) <= infy(x). 

Combining, we get: infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This doesn't match the constraint 2 for SW, which is supy(x) <= infy(z). Actually, it suggests the opposite, infy(z) <= supy(x). So, SW is probably not a possible relation between x and z.

Actually, I'm trying to be too strict here. We need to think about our setup. The original tile-based cardinal directions are defined to be mutual exclusive. So, if a region is in one of the cardinal tile directions, it can't be in another. But let's look at our constraints again.

Recall that a region x can be in the following directions to a region z: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B. 

From our analysis:
1. x can't be in the B or E tile of z, because x is entirely to the left of z.
2. x can't be in the SE, S, or SW tile of z, because we derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z. For x to be in one of these tiles, it would need to be below z.
3. x can't be in the NE tile of z, because x is entirely to the left of z.

So, that leaves the N, NW, and W tiles as potential positions for x relative to z.

Let's check if x can be in the N tile of z. For x to be N of z, we need:
supy(z) <= infy(x) (constraint 1)
infx(z) <= infx(x) (constraint 2)
supx(x) <= supx(z) (constraint 3)

We've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts both constraint 2 (infx(z) <= infx(x)) and constraint 3 (supx(x) <= supx(z)) for N. The reason is that x is entirely to the left of z, so its x-coordinates can't be bounded by z. So, x can't be in the N tile of z.

Now, let's check the NW tile. For x to be NW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (constraint 1, already satisfied)
supy(z) <= infy(x) (constraint 2)

We've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), so constraint 1 is satisfied. But we don't have a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) from our given constraints. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is in the NW tile of z. If not, then x is not in the NW tile of z.

Let's check the W tile. For x to be W of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (constraint 1, already satisfied)
infy(z) <= infy(x) (constraint 2, already satisfied)
supy(x) <= supy(z) (constraint 3)

We've derived supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), so constraints 1 and 2 are satisfied. But we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) from our given constraints. If supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is in the W tile of z. If not, then x is not in the W tile of z.

Hmm actually, let's re-check things from scratch. 

From the given:
1. x is N of y (x N y)
2. y is W of z (y W z)

From x N y, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (bottom edge of y is above or at the same height as the bottom edge of z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (top edge of y is below or at the same height as the top edge of z)

Let me review and re-derive the constraints for the cardinal directions from our given constraints:

For N (x N z), we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our derived constraints, we have:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This directly contradicts two of the conditions for N: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), because if supx(x) <= infx(z), then supx(x) is to the left of infx(z), and it can't be to the right or at the same level as infx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

For NE (x NE z), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our derived constraints, we have:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This directly contradicts the condition for NE: supx(z) <= infx(x), because if supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is entirely to the left of z, and it can't be to the right of z. So, x cannot be NE of z.

For E (x E z), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our derived constraints, we have:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
This directly contradicts the condition for E: supx(z) <= infx(x), for the same reason as above. So, x cannot be E of z.

For SE (x SE z), we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our derived constraints, we have:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
The first line contradicts the condition for SE: supx(z) <= infx(x), for the same reason as above. Also, the second line suggests infy(z) <= infy(x), which is not consistent with supy(x) <= infy(z), given that infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region. So, x cannot be SE of z.

For S (x S z), we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

The third condition of S, supx(x) <= supx(z), doesn't contradict the fact that x is to the left of z. An x can be to the left of z while still having an x-projection that is completely "within" the x-projection of z, i.e., infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). 

But I found infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x). And for any region, infy(x) <= supy(x). So, infy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts the condition for S: supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

For SW (x SW z), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've derived:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which satisfies the first condition.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
From the second line, we have infy(z) <= infy(x). And since for any region, infy(x) <= supy(x), we get infy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the condition for SW: supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

For W (x W z), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've derived:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which satisfies the first condition.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which satisfies the second condition.
So, as long as supy(x) <= supy(z), x can be W of z. But we haven't directly derived a relationship between supy(x) and supy(z), so W is a possible relation, but it's not guaranteed.

Actually, wait. Let's use what we know.
x N y, so supy(y) <= infy(x)
y W z, so supy(y) <= supy(z)
This gives us supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)). So both supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). But we don't have a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z) from these. Yes, so x W z is possible.

For NW (x NW z), we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've derived:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which satisfies the first condition.
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
From the second line, if supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NW of z. But if supy(z) > infy(x), then x is not NW of z. Since we don't have a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x), NW is a possible relation, but it's not guaranteed.

For B (x B z), we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've derived:
- supx(x) <= infx(z), which directly contradicts the condition for B: infx(z) <= infx(x). And also, if supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the left of z. So, x cannot be inside the bounding box of z (B).

I'm going to re-derive the constraints, and try to simplify the logic.

From what we have:
x N y, which means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

y W z, which means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, here's what we can derive:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) => supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) => infy(z) <= infy(x) (bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as bottom edge of z)

Given these derivations, let's see which cardinal directions could be possible for x relative to z:

1. N: x needs to be above z and its x-projection needs to be bounded by z. But we've derived that x is to the left of z, which contradicts the x-bounding condition. So, x cannot be in the N direction of z.

2. NE: x needs to be to the right of and above z. But we've derived that x is to the left of z, contradicting the "to the right of" requirement. So, x cannot be in the NE direction of z.

3. E: x needs to be to the right of z and its y-projection needs to be bounded by z. But again, x is to the left of z, contradicting the "to the right of" requirement. So, x cannot be in the E direction of z.

4. SE: x needs to be to the right of and below z. But x is to the left of z, and we've also derived that the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z, contradicting both the "to the right of" and "below" requirements. So, x cannot be in the SE direction of z.

5. S: x needs to be below z and its x-projection needs to be bounded by z. But we've derived that x is to the left of z, which contradicts the x-bounding condition. Additionally, the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z, contradicting the "below" requirement. So, x cannot be in the S direction of z.

6. SW: x needs to be to the left of and below z. While x is to the left of z, the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z, contradicting the "below" requirement. So, x cannot be in the SW direction of z.

7. W: x needs to be to the left of z and its y-projection needs to be bounded by z. We've derived that x is to the left of z and its bottom edge is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z. But we don't have a direct derivation for the top edge relationship. For the y-projection to be bounded by z, we'd need supy(x) <= supy(z). So, W is a possible direction if this condition is satisfied.

8. NW: x needs to be to the left of and above z. We've derived that x is to the left of z. For x to be above z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). But we don't have a direct relation between supy(z) and infy(x) from our derivations. So, NW is a possible direction if this condition is satisfied.

9. B: x needs to be inside the bounding box of z. But we've derived that x is to the left of z, which means it can't be inside z's bounding box. So, x cannot be in the B direction of z.

Given all of this, the only possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are W and NW.

To summarize, if region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then the possible relations between region x and region z are W and NW.

Hmm wait. Let's think about this differently, maybe a simpler approach. We're given that x is N of y, and y is W of z. Those are single-tiled cardinal directions. So let me derive which single-tiled cardinal direction x can be with respect to z.

- If x is N of y, it means x is entirely above y.
- If y is W of z, it means y is entirely to the left of z.

Combining these, and given the spatial arrangement, x must be to the left of z (since y is to the left of z, and x is positioned above y). But the height relationship between x and z isn't immediately clear.

Actually, if I try to create a sketch (text-based for clarity):

```
   x
   |
   y--z
```

or

```
   x
   |
y--z
```

or

```
           x
           |
   y--z
```

In the sketches above, x is N of y, and y is W of z. But the relation between x and z could be:
1. x is NW of z (in the first sketch)
2. x is W of z (in the second sketch)
3. x is SW of z (in the third sketch)

But is the third sketch valid? Let's check using the constraints:

From x N y, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (bottom edge of y is not below the bottom edge of z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (top edge of y is not above the top edge of z)

Let's verify our derivation again. From the given, can we determine the relation between infy(z) and supy(x)?

From x N y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y W z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y).

Combining, we getinfy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). So infy(z) <= infy(x).

Can we derive a relation between supy(x) and infy(z)?  Actually, I don't think so. Given only infy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have a direct constraint on supy(x) relative to infy(z). For all we know, supy(x) could be less than, equal to, or greater than infy(z).

OK, so it seems like the third sketch could be valid. Let's double check to make sure if it is.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

And we have:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), satisfying the first constraint.
- infy(z) <= infy(x) for the second constraint.

But infy(z) <= infy(x) doesn't directly tell us about the relation between supy(x) and infy(z). But generally, for any region, infy(region) <= supy(region). So, infy(x) <= supy(x). Combining, we get infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).

Hmm, this actually suggests supy(x) >= infy(z), which doesn't match the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for SW. So I'm not sure there can be a scenario where x is SW of z. But let me verify one more time to be thorough.

Actually, the source of my confusion is that I'm trying to determine if infy(z) <= supy(x) or supy(x) <= infy(z) based on the given constraints. 

Let's reason this out differently. We have:
1. infy(z) <= infy(x) (from earlier derivation)
2. For any valid region, infy(region) <= supy(region). In our case, infy(x) <= supy(x).

From 1 and 2, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which means infy(z) <= supy(x). This implies that the top edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z. For x to be SW of z, we'd need the top edge of x to be below the bottom edge of z, which contradicts our derivation. So, x cannot be SW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are only W and NW.

OK, so far, I think that the answer is that the possible relations between x and z are W and NW.

But let me check if I missed any other possible relation. So after rechecking, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. W (x is entirely to the left of z, and the y-projection of x is within the y-projection of z)
2. NW (x is entirely to the left of and above z)

And just to double check, I'll verify again:

If region x is N of region y, and region y is W of region z, then:
1. We can derive that x is entirely to the left of z, ruling out the directions N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.
2. We can also derive that the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z, ruling out the directions SW, again.

So the the possible relations between region x and region z are W and NW. And that is my final answer.

Ah, actually now that I think about it, let me verify one more time that x can't be S or SW with respect to z.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z)

But we've derived that x is entirely to the left of z, which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for S. So, x cannot be S of z.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

We've already confirmed that x is to the left of z, so the first condition is satisfied. But we've also derived infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z. This, combined with the fact that for any region, infy(region) <= supy(region), tells us that infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for SW. So, x cannot be SW of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z remain W and NW.

Actually, now that I think about W, are we sure x can be W of z?

Let's go back to the definition.

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (bottom edge of x is not below the bottom edge of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (top edge of x is not above the top edge of z)

We've verified the first two conditions, but we're not sure about the third one, whether supy(x) <= supy(z). But thinking about it, let's say we have a situation where supy(x) > supy(z). This would mean the top edge of x is above the top edge of z. Given that x is to the left of z, if the top edge of x is above the top edge of z and the bottom edge of x is not below the bottom edge of z, then x and z have a northwest-southeast relationship. Specifically, x would be in the northwest of z.

So actually, I think the third sketch I drew is not valid, and the third condition would make sure that relation is W (x is positioned laterally, not diagonally)

So to go back to what we've been verifying all along, the possible relations between region x and region z are W and NW. And that really is my final answer. W and NW.

ANSWER:

Based on the constraints given, I'll analyze the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is W of region z

From these constraints, I can derive the following:

From x N y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (left edge of x is constrained by y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (right edge of x is constrained by y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (bottom edge of y is constrained by z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (top edge of y is constrained by z)

Combining these constraints:
1. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   This proves x is entirely to the left of z

2. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   This proves the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z

Based on these derivations, x must be to the left of z, but its vertical relationship with z could vary. Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

NW, W
