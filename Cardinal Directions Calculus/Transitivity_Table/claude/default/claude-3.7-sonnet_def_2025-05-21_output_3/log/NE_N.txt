PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step, using the given definitions.

We have:
- x is NE of y, which means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z, which means: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now let's try to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From x NE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y N z, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's see what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z.

Considering the x-coordinates:
- From supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we can't directly determine how infx(x) relates to supx(z). It could be that infx(x) <= supx(z) or supx(z) < infx(x).
- From y N z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), but we don't have a direct relationship between infx(y) and infx(x) from x NE y.

Considering the y-coordinates:
- From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y), we can use transitivity to say supy(z) <= infy(x).

Based on this, we know for sure that supy(z) <= infy(x). This means the possible relations between x and z include:
- N: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- NE: If supx(z) <= infx(x)
- NW: If supx(x) <= infx(z)

Wait, I need to be more careful. Let me check my reasoning again.

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

From y N z, we have supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Let's try to derive the constraints for x and z.

For the y-coordinates, we have:
supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z)
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

By transitivity, we get supy(z) <= infy(x). This means that x is to the North of z.

For the x-coordinates, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)
supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)

From the last two, we get supx(y) <= min(supx(z), infx(x)), which doesn't tell us directly how supx(z) compares to infx(x).

Let's consider cases:
1. If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is to the East of z, which combined with x being to the North of z, means x is NE of z.
2. If infx(x) <= supx(z), then we need more information to determine the relation.

Now, we also have infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z), but we don't have a direct relationship between infx(y) and infx(x) from x NE y.

So, from the given information, we can't definitively say what the relation between x and z is, but it seems that x is to the North of z and might be NE, N, or perhaps even NW.

Actually, I'm noticing that I'm making an error with the approach. Let me think about this differently in terms of the bounding boxes.

We have:
- x is NE of y, so the bounding box of x is entirely to the northeast of the bounding box of y. This means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y is N of z, so the bounding box of y is entirely to the north of the bounding box of z. This means supy(z) <= infy(y), and the x-projection of the bounding box of y is contained within the x-projection of the bounding box of z (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)).

Now, let's think about where x could be relative to z.

First, we know from supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) that supy(z) <= infy(x). This confirms that x is to the North of z in terms of the y-coordinate.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)

From the first two, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This confirms that infx(z) <= infx(x).

We also know that supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x). This means that supx(y) <= min(supx(z), infx(x)).

If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is to the East of z, which combined with x being to the North of z, means x is NE of z.

If infx(x) <= supx(z), then the x-coordinate of x might overlap with the x-coordinate of z. There are a few possibilities:
1. If infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x might be NW of z.
2. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x might be N of z.
3. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= supx(x), then x might be NE of z.

Hmm, this is still not conclusive. Let me think about this yet again using a visual approach.

Given the definition of NE, when we say "x is NE of y", it means the bounding box of x is entirely to the northeast of y's, i.e., both to the north and to the east. This means the westernmost point of x is to the east of the easternmost point of y, and the southernmost point of x is to the north of the northernmost point of y.

Similarly, "y is N of z" means y's bounding box is entirely to the north of z's, and the x-coordinate of y is contained within the x-coordinate of z.

Let's visualize this. If the world is divided into a grid:
- z could occupy a region in the South.
- y would be directly to the North of z, and not as wide as z (its x-projection is contained within z's x-projection).
- x would be to the Northeast of y, meaning it's to the East and North of y.

Now, considering where x could be relative to z:
1. It's definitely to the North of z (because y is to the North of z, and x is to the North of y).
2. It might be to the East of z, to the Northeast of z, or overlap with z in the x-coordinate.

Let's be precise: 
- We know supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x). This confirms that x is to the North of z in terms of the y-coordinate.
- From y N z, we know that infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
- From x NE y, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x).

From these, we can derive infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This tells us that the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z, and to the right of the rightmost point of y.

But we don't have a direct relationship between infx(x) and supx(z), or between supx(x) and infx(z). This is key to determining whether x is to the East, Northeast, or North of z.

Actually, on re-reading, I realize that I was confusing myself. The cardinal directions are defined based on the relationship between regions, not points.

Let's revisit the definitions:

1. a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
2. a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

So, "x is NE of y" means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
"y is N of z" means supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. We know supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x). This confirms that x is to the North of z in terms of the y-coordinate.

2. For the x-coordinate:
   - From "y is N of z", we know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
   - From "x is NE of y", we know supx(y) <= infx(x).

But we don't have a direct relation between supx(x) and supx(z), or between infx(x) and infx(z). This means there are multiple possibilities for the relation between x and z.

Let's enumerate the possible relations:

1. N: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. This is possible because we know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), and supx(y) <= infx(x). But we don't have constraints on supx(x) relative to supx(z).

2. NE: If supx(z) <= infx(x). This is possible if the x-projection of z is entirely to the left of the x-projection of x. Given supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z), it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x).

3. NW: This would mean supx(x) <= infx(z). But from infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y), we have infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be NW of z.

4. B: This would mean infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But from supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y), we have supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x cannot be inside the bounding box of z.

5. E: This would mean supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But from supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y), we have supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x cannot be E of z.

6. SE: This would mean supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But from supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y), we have supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SE of z.

7. S: This would mean supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But from supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y), we have supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

8. SW: This would mean supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But from infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y), we have infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

9. W: This would mean supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But from infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y), we have infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

Let's get back to the main question: What are the possible relations between x and z? Considering the above, the possible relations are N and NE. 

Actually, I want to double-check my reasoning for some of these. It's possible I made an error:

For NW:
We would need to check: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x). This is consistent with NW.
- infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

Hmm, I see the issue with my reasoning. Just because infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), it doesn't necessarily mean supx(x) cannot be less than or equal to infx(z). In fact, if supx(x) <= infx(z), then it could be a valid NW relation.

Let me reconsider the possible relations more carefully:

1. N: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We don't have a constraint on supx(x) relative to supx(z), so N is possible.

2. NE: If supx(z) <= infx(x). Given supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z), it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x). So, NE is possible.

3. NW: If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(z) <= infy(x), and from (y N z and x NE y) we know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). Based on this, I can't determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) directly. So, NW can't be ruled out based on the given constraints. But, applying our understanding: The west-eastmost point of x being more west than the easternmost point of y, which is more west than the westernmost point of z sounds contradictory to x being NE of y. Let me double check.

Actually, I realize that the point I just made is not well-defined because the constraints I'm discussing are about the bounding boxes of the regions, not the regions themselves.

Let's go back to the definitions:
NW: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

For "x is NW of z", we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

We know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y), so supy(z) <= infy(x). This constraint is satisfied.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y).

Without additional constraints, I can't determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). So, NW remains a possibility.

Ok, this is getting a bit frustrating. Let's take a deep breath and think from scratch:

We want the possible relations between x and z given that:
- x is NE of y.
- y is N of z.

Let's define these relations and derive what we know:

1. "x is NE of y" means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)

2. "y is N of z" means:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's derive what we know about the relationship between x and z:

1. From supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

This confirms that x is to the North of z.

2. From infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we have:
   - infx(z) <= supx(y)

3. From supx(y) <= infx(x), we have:
   - infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

Given these constraints, let's revisit the possible relations:

1. N: x is North of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've already confirmed supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which tells us infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - But we don't have constraints on supx(x) relative to supx(z). So, the N relation is still possible.

2. NE: x is Northeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've already confirmed supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but we can't deduce the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x) from this. So, the NE relation is still possible.

3. NW: x is Northwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've already confirmed supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us infx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with x being to the East of z, not to the West. There are no constraints to ensure supx(x) <= infx(z). So, I'm not sure if the NW relation is possible.

4. B, S, SW, W, SE, E: Given that x is to the North of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), these relations are all impossible because they would require x to be at least partly to the South of z.

So, tentatively, the possible relations are N, NE, and maybe NW.

Let me re-check the NW relationship:

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

The second constraint is already confirmed.

For the first, we need to understand if infx(z) can be greater than supx(x) given the other constraints. We know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)

These don't give us a direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). But let's think geometrically.

If x is NE of y and y is N of z, then x is to the Northeast of y, which is to the North of z. This placement inherently suggests that x is to the Northeast or North of z. For x to be to the Northwest of z, it would need to wrap around from the Northeast of y to the Northwest of z, which seems geometrically implausible.

Ah, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's draw out a diagram:

z is at the bottom. 
y is directly above z and is contained within the x-projection of z.
x is to the Northeast of y.

From this visualization, x can be:
- Directly North of z (if the x-projection of x overlaps with the x-projection of z).
- Northeast of z (if the x-projection of x is entirely to the right of the x-projection of z).

But for x to be Northwest of z, it would need to be to the left of the x-projection of z. Given that x is to the northeast of y, and y is above z, it seems geometrically impossible for x to be to the Northwest of z. So, NW is not a valid relation.

To be absolutely clear:

From "y is N of z" and "x is NE of y", we can visualize that x is either directly North of z or to the Northeast of z. By tracing through the constraints, we've confirmed that x is to the North of z.

Actually, let me try drawing out a more concrete case.

Scenario 1:
```
   x
 y
z
```
In this case, x is NE of y, y is N of z, and x is NE of z.

Scenario 2:
```
   x
 y
zzzzz
```
Here, x is NE of y, y is N of z, and x is N of z.

Is it possible for x to be NW of z? Given that x is NE of y, x would need to be to the East of y. If x is to the West of z, then y must also be to the West of z (since x is to the East of y). But if y is to the West of z, then y cannot be directly North of z. So, I think NW is indeed impossible based on the given constraints.

I think I've been overthinking this. I let me reconsider:

1. x is NE of y: This means x is entirely to the NE of y. So, supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
2. y is N of z: This means y is entirely to the N of z, with the x-projection of y contained within the x-projection of z. So, supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Now, for x to be NW of z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

From the given conditions, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y), which gives us supy(z) <= infy(x). This is consistent with x being NW of z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y), which gives us infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= infx(x).

But for NW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). Given infx(z) <= infx(x), for supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, we would need supx(x) <= infx(x). While this is not inherently contradictory, it means that the x-projection of x is empty or has a single point. Since we're dealing with regions in REG, which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk and thus have a non-empty interior, this scenario seems implausible.

So, NW is likely not a valid relation between x and z given the constraints.

Ah, I've been overthinking this by making it unnecessarily complicated. Let's actually check this from definition.

For x NE y, we have: 
- supx(y) <= infx(x) 
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

For y N z, we have:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x NW z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so x is indeed North of z. But we also know infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This gives us infx(z) <= infx(x), which means the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z. This contradicts the requirement for NW that the rightmost point of x should be to the left of the leftmost point of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)). So, NW is not possible.

Let me finally list the possible relations between x and z based on the given constraints:

1. N: If the x-projection of x overlaps with the x-projection of z. This is possible based on the given constraints.
2. NE: If the x-projection of x is entirely to the right of the x-projection of z. This is also possible based on the given constraints.

That's it. Given the constraint that x is NE of y and y is N of z, the only possible relationships between x and z are N and NE.

Hmm, let me double-check:

For x N z, we need: 
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x). But do we know supx(x) <= supx(z)? We don't have a direct constraint for this.

From "y is N of z", we have supx(y) <= supx(z).
From "x is NE of y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x).

But we don't have a constraint on supx(x) relative to supx(z). So the N relation is possible only if supx(x) <= supx(z).

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know supy(z) <= infy(x). As for the other constraint, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)

If supx(z) <= infx(x), then the NE relation is valid. But we don't have a direct constraint for this.

So, the relation between x and z depends on the actual positions of the regions. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is NE of z. If supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is N of z. And, it's also possible that they fulfill both relations if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supx(z) <= infx(x). However, this configuration seems geometrically implausible, since it would require x to be both bounded by and outside of the x-projection of z.

So, more realistically, the relation between x and z is either N or NE, depending on the relative positions of the regions, and these can't be both true at the same time.

Actually, I think I've been thinking in cases rather than in general. Let's think about this more holistically.

Given the constraints:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Let's combine these to see the range of possible relations between x and z.

Given the constraint on y-coordinates (supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)), we can definitively say that x is to the North of z.

Now, for the x-coordinates, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x)

The best we can deduce is infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This just tells us that the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of z, and the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of x and to the left of the rightmost point of z.

This is not sufficient to pinpoint the exact relationship between x and z, so I'll enumerate the possible cases based on the constraints:

1. N: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. As per our derived constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x), but we don't have a constraint that ensures supx(x) <= supx(z). So, this relation is possible but not necessary.

2. NE: If supx(z) <= infx(x). This means the x-projection of x is to the right of the x-projection of z. From our derived constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). While this doesn't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x), it doesn't rule it out either. So, this relation is possible but not necessary.

3. NW: The constraint would be supx(x) <= infx(z), but we've established that infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the NW constraint. So, x cannot be NW of z.

4. E: The constraints would be supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've established that x is to the North of z, so this relation is impossible.

5. W: The constraint would be supx(x) <= infx(z), but we've shown this is impossible. So, x cannot be W of z.

6. SE: The constraint would be supy(x) <= infy(z), but we've established that x is to the North of z, so this relation is impossible.

7. SW: The constraints would be supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've shown the first is impossible, and the second contradicts the fact that x is to the North of z. So, x cannot be SW of z.

8. S: The constraints would be supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The first contradicts the fact that x is to the North of z, so this relation is impossible.

9. B: The constraints would be infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The last one contradicts the fact that x is to the North of z, so this relation is impossible.

So, given the constraints, the only possible relationships between x and z are N and NE.

But wait, I need to double check the last two cases to make sure I'm thinking clearly here:

If x is N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've already confirmed the first two constraints. For the third, we don't have a direct constraint. We know from supx(y) <= supx(z) that y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection. But we don't know the width of x. It's possible for x to be wider than z (even though it's to the northeast of y). So, the N relation is possible if x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection.

If x is NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've already confirmed the second constraint. For the first, we know from "x is NE of y" that x is entirely to the right of y, i.e. supx(y) <= infx(x). Since y is to the north of z, and we know supx(y) <= supx(z) but don't know the relative widths of y and z, we can't determine for sure the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). So, the NE relation is possible if x is entirely to the right of z.

So yes, the possible relations between x and z are N and NE, depending on the relative positions of the regions. The other relations are geometrically impossible based on the given constraints.

Actually, wait, let me check:

1. B is definitely excluded because, per definition, for x B z, we would need supy(x) <= supy(z). And we know supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y), which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts the B requirement for x.

Let's re-review:

The possible relations between x and z given that x is NE of y and y is N of z are:
- N: x is North of z (if the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z).
- NE: x is Northeast of z (if the x-projection of x is entirely to the right of the x-projection of z).

To reason through other options:
- NW: This would imply that the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z. But our constraints indicate that the leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of y, and y is within the x-bounds of z, so this is not possible.
- E, SE, S, SW, W, B: These all would imply that x is not entirely to the North of z, which contradicts the fact that we've established x is to the North of z.

And so, yes, the only possible relations are N and NE.

Wait, I might have made a mistake:

If x is NE of y, then:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

And if y is N of z, then:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, for x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x).
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).

But we don't know if supx(x) <= supx(z). If x has a smaller x-extent than z, then x is N of z. Otherwise, it's not.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x).
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), but we don't have a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). It's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x), or infx(x) <= supx(z).

So I think our constraints allow for NE; it's also compatible with N as long as x doesn't extend too far right. But could it also be compatible with other directions? Let me check the other options:

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x).
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).

Given infx(z) <= infx(x), it's impossible to also have supx(x) <= infx(z) unless the x-projection of x is degenerate (i.e., a single point). Since we're dealing with regions in REG, which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, the x-projection would have a non-zero width. So, x cannot be NW of z.

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is to the North of z, which contradicts the requirement for E that x can also be to the South of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

For x to be W of z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z), but I've already shown this is impossible based on the constraints.

For x to be SE of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z), but this contradicts the fact that x is to the North of z.

Similarly, for S, SW, and B, we'd need x to have parts to the South of z, which contradicts the fact that x is to the North of z.

So, after revisiting all possible relations, the only viable ones are N and NE.

Actually, there's one final relation that we thought isn't possible, where the relationship could be that, in addition to above, we have B. So let's just check if we can have x B z as follows.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

I've already shown x can't be to the South of z, so I just need to check if x can be contained within the x-coordinates of z.

We know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).

This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which satisfies the first constraint. But it doesn't guarantee that supx(x) <= supx(z), which is required for B. 

But the main reason why x B z is impossible is because x is to the North of z. This means the bottom of x is above the top of z. But for x to be inside the bounding box of z, the bottom of x would need to be below or at the same level as the top of z. These are contradictory conditions, so x cannot be B of z.

In conclusion, given the constraints "x is NE of y" and "y is N of z", the only possible relationships between x and z are N and NE. All other cardinal directions are geometrically impossible.

So the answer is: N and NE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z given that x is NE of y and y is N of z.

First, let me analyze what these relations tell us:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is entirely to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is definitely to the north of z
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means the westernmost point of x is to the east of the westernmost point of z

The possible relations between x and z are:

1. N - If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), meaning x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection.

2. NE - If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning x is entirely to the east of z.

No other cardinal direction relations are possible because x must be to the north of z, and the constraints on the x-coordinates rule out NW, W, SW relations.

The answer is: N, NE
