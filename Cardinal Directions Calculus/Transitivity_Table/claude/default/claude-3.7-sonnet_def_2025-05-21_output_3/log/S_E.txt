PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's step through this problem logically. We're given that:
- region x is S of region y
- region y is E of region z

And we need to find all possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall what these cardinal direction relations mean based on the definitions provided:

1. x is S of y means:
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is at or to the right of y's left edge)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is at or to the left of y's right edge)

2. y is E of z means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom edge is at or above z's bottom edge)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top edge is at or below z's top edge)

Now, we need to analyze what these constraints together tell us about the possible relations between x and z.

From x is S of y, we know that x is below y. From y is E of z, we know that y is to the right of z. This means that x is below and potentially to the right of z.

Let's analyze the x and y coordinates separately:

For the x-coordinates:
- From "x is S of y": infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From "y is E of z": supx(z) <= infx(y)

Combining these, we have:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

This means that region x is entirely to the right of region z (at least in terms of x-coordinates).

For the y-coordinates:
- From "x is S of y": supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From "y is E of z": infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Unlike the x-coordinates, we can't make a clear determination about the relative positions of x and z in terms of y-coordinates based solely on the given constraints. The relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) is not specified, so x could be below, overlapping, or even above z in the y-direction.

Let's consider all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. SE (South East): If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   Given our constraints, we know that supx(z) <= infx(x), so the x-coordinate condition for SE is satisfied. But we don't know the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z), so SE is a possibility but not guaranteed.

2. E (East): If supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), so the x-coordinate condition for E is satisfied. But we don't have clear constraints for the y-coordinates, so E is a possibility but not guaranteed.

3. NE (North East): If supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x).
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), so the x-coordinate condition for NE is satisfied. But we don't know the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x), so NE is a possibility but not guaranteed.

4. S (South): If supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   Given our constraints, we don't know if infx(z) <= infx(x) or if supx(x) <= supx(z). In fact, we derived that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition for S. So, S is not a possibility.

5. B (Bounding Box): If infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Given that supx(z) <= infx(x), we have a contradiction for the condition supx(x) <= supx(z). So, B is not a possibility.

6. N (North): If supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   Given that supx(z) <= infx(x), we have a contradiction for the condition supx(x) <= supx(z). So, N is not a possibility.

7. SW (South West): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Given our constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), we have a contradiction for the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) (since infx(z) <= supx(z) and transitively supx(x) <= infx(z) is contradicted). So, SW is not a possibility.

8. W (West): If supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Given our constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), we have a contradiction for the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not a possibility.

9. NW (North West): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Given our constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), we have a contradiction for the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not a possibility.

Hmm, let me be a little more careful here. The constraints I've been deriving aren't quite right. Let me think step by step.

From region x is S of region y, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From region y is E of region z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's see what these tell us about the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
- From y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
- From x is S of y: infx(y) <= infx(x)
Combining these, we get: supx(z) <= infx(x), which means region x is entirely to the right of region z in the x-direction.

Additionally, from x is S of y, we have supx(x) <= supx(y), but this doesn't give us a direct constraint on the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

For the y-coordinates:
- From y is E of z: infy(z) <= infy(y)
- From x is S of y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
Combining these, we get... actually, we can't make a direct comparison between infy(z) and supy(x) from these inequalities.

Similarly, from y is E of z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z), but this doesn't give us a direct constraint on the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or infy(x) and infy(z).

So, from our constraints, we can only definitively say that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means region x is entirely to the right of region z in the x-direction. For the y-direction, there's no definitive constraint, which means region x could be below, overlap with, or be above region z in the y-direction.

This gives us the following possibilities:
- SE (South East): If supy(x) <= infy(z)
- E (East): If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- NE (North East): If supy(z) <= infy(x)

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. Let me go back to basics and think this through more systematically. I'll restate what I know and then systematically check each possible relation.

From region x is S of region y, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From region y is E of region z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, I'll check each possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z:

1. SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

   We already derived that supx(z) <= infx(x), so the first condition is met. However, we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, SE is a possibility if supy(x) <= infy(z).

2. E (East): For x to be E of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (z's bottom is below or at x's bottom)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is below or at z's top)

   We already derived that supx(z) <= infx(x), so the first condition is met. However, we don't have direct constraints on the other two conditions. So, E is a possibility if both infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

3. NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

   We already derived that supx(z) <= infx(x), so the first condition is met. However, we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). So, NE is a possibility if supy(z) <= infy(x).

4. S (South): For x to be S of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left is to the left or at x's left)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right is to the left or at z's right)

   We know that supx(z) <= infx(x) from our derived constraints. This implies that region x is entirely to the right of region z in the x-direction, which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for S. So, S is not a possibility.

5. B (Bounding Box): For x to be B of z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left is to the left or at x's left)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right is to the left or at z's right)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (z's bottom is below or at x's bottom)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is below or at z's top)

   Again, we know that supx(z) <= infx(x) from our derived constraints, which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for B. So, B is not a possibility.

6. N (North): For x to be N of z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left is to the left or at x's left)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right is to the left or at z's right)

   As with S and B, the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for N. So, N is not a possibility.

7. SW (South West): For x to be SW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

   The constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) implies that x is to the right of z, which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for SW. So, SW is not a possibility.

8. W (West): For x to be W of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) (z's bottom is below or at x's bottom)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is below or at z's top)

   Again, the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for W. So, W is not a possibility.

9. NW (North West): For x to be NW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

   As with SW and W, the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for NW. So, NW is not a possibility.

From this analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- SE (South East): If supy(x) <= infy(z)
- E (East): If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- NE (North East): If supy(z) <= infy(x)

Actually, let me clarify my thinking. Let's say we have regions positioned as follows:

```
   z
    y
     x
```

Here, x is S of y, and y is E of z. In this arrangement, x would be SE of z.

Now, let's consider:

```
   z
    y
  x
```

Here, x is S of y, y is E of z, but x is S of z.

Wait, but I thought I determined S was not a possibility. Let me re-check.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left is to the left or at x's left)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right is to the left or at z's right)

From our derived constraints, we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which means region x is entirely to the right of region z in the x-direction. This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for S. So, S is not a possibility.

Wait, I think I've been misinterpreting the constraint. Let me clarify.

From region x is S of region y, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is at or to the right of y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is at or to the left of y's right edge)

Basically, x is below y and is restricted to be within the horizontal extent of y.

From region y is E of region z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom edge is at or above z's bottom edge)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top edge is at or below z's top edge)

Basically, y is to the right of z and is restricted to be within the vertical extent of z.

So, let's visualize this:

```
z z z
z z z y y
z z z y y
      x x
      x x
```

Here, x is S of y, and y is E of z. In this arrangement, x would be SE of z.

But there are other arrangements as well. For instance:

```
z z z
z z z y y
z z z y y
  x x
  x x
```

In this arrangement, x is S of y, and y is E of z, but x might not be SE of z; it could be E of z.

I think I need to be more systematic. Let's set up coordinate bounds for regions x, y, and z based on the constraints, and then see which relations are possible.

For region y:
- Let's say its bounds are [infx(y), supx(y)] x [infy(y), supy(y)].

For region z:
- Based on "y is E of z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y), which means z is to the left of y.
- Also, infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means y is contained within the vertical extent of z.

For region x:
- Based on "x is S of y", we have supy(x) <= infy(y), which means x is below y.
- Also, infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), which means x is contained within the horizontal extent of y.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. From "y is E of z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
2. From "x is S of y", we have infx(y) <= infx(x).
Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(x), which means region x is entirely to the right of region z in the x-direction.

3. From "y is E of z", we have infy(z) <= infy(y).
4. From "x is S of y", we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
Combining these, we get a constraint on supy(x) relative to infy(z), but it's not direct.

Based on the constraints, region x must be to the right of region z, but its vertical position relative to z is not definitively constrained. This gives us the following possibilities:

- SE (South East): If x is below z.
- E (East): If x overlaps vertically with z.
- NE (North East): If x is above z.

Alright, I think my understanding of this problem has been flawed in my previous attempts. By drawing some simple diagrams and being precise with the definitions, I can more clearly see the possibilities.

Let's reconsider the situation:

From region x is S of region y, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is within the horizontal extent of y)

From region y is E of region z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is within the vertical extent of z)

From these constraints, we can derive that supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means region x is entirely to the right of region z in the x-direction.

But the constraints don't give us a definitive relation between the vertical positions of x and z. The constraint supy(x) <= infy(y) tells us that x is below y, and the constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) tells us that the bottom of y is at or above the bottom of z. But this doesn't tell us whether x is below, at, or above z in terms of the y-coordinate.

Given that x is to the right of z, and there's no definitive constraint on their vertical relationship, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: SE, E, and NE.

I think I've been making this more complicated than it needs to be. To summarize:

1. SE (South East): If x is below z, which is possible based on the constraints.
2. E (East): If x overlaps vertically with z, which is possible based on the constraints.
3. NE (North East): If x is above z, which is also possible based on the constraints.

And I'm confident these are the only possibilities.

Wait, I'm not sure about NE actually. Let me double-check.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

From our constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), so the first condition is met.

For the second condition, we need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible given the constraints:
- From "y is E of z", we have supy(y) <= supy(z), which means the top of y is at or below the top of z.
- From "x is S of y", we have supy(x) <= infy(y), which means x is below y.

If we combine these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (top of y is at or below top of z). However, these don't directly constrain infy(x) relative to supy(z). In fact, it's theoretically possible to have an arrangement where supy(z) <= infy(x).

Ok, I'll go back to essentials one more time and think through the possible relations carefully.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is E of region z

1. S of means:
   - The top of x is below the bottom of y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
   - x is horizontally contained within y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

2. E of means:
   - The right of z is to the left of the left of y: supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - y is vertically contained within z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can deduce that supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is entirely to the right of z (at least in terms of the x-coordinate).

We also know that supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). But these don't give us a clear constraint on the vertical relationship between x and z.

Let's break it down into cases:

Case 1: supy(x) <= infy(z)
This means x is below z. Combined with the horizontal constraint that x is to the right of z, this gives the relation SE (South East): x is SE of z.

Case 2: infy(z) <= supy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(z)
This means x and z overlap vertically. Combined with the horizontal constraint that x is to the right of z, this gives the relation E (East): x is E of z.

Wait, let me rethink this. For x to be E of z, we need three conditions:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the bottom of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is below or at the top of z)

We've deduced supx(z) <= infx(x). The other two conditions are specific to the E relation.

Now, let's check if there's a way to constrain infy(z) relative to infy(x) and supy(x) relative to supy(z) based on our given constraints:

From "y is E of z", we have:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

From "x is S of y", we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

We can't directly derive a constraint for infy(z) relative to infy(x) or for supy(x) relative to supy(z) from these.

So, based on the given constraints, both conditions for E (East) are possible.

Case 3: supy(z) <= infy(x)
This means x is above z. Combined with the horizontal constraint that x is to the right of z, this gives the relation NE (North East): x is NE of z.

For this to be possible, we need to check if there's a contradiction with the given constraints.

From "y is E of z", we have supy(y) <= supy(z).
From "x is S of y", we have supy(x) <= infy(y).

If we have supy(z) <= infy(x), then we can deduce: supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x).

But we also know that supy(x) <= infy(y) from the S relation. Combining these: supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(x) >= supy(y).

Ok, hang on a second. Maybe going back to a drawing is the clearer way to understand this:

Let's imagine the three regions as rectangles for clarity. From the constraints, we know:

1. Region x is S of region y:
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally contained within y)

2. Region y is E of region z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically contained within z)

So, a basic setup would be:

```
   z z z
   z z z y y
   z z z y y
         x x
         x x
```

Given the constraints, the horizontal relationships are fixed: z is to the left of y, and x is horizontally contained within y. But the vertical relationships have some flexibility.

I've been trying to determine if x can be NE of z. Let's analyze this.

For x to be NE of z, two conditions must be met:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), so the first condition is met.

For the second condition, let's check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible given our constraints.

Actually let me take a step back and think about this differently. 

Let's consider the constraint x is S of y, which means supy(x) <= infy(y).

Also, y is E of z, which means infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

This means that we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

From the first two, we can derive supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but we can't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z). So, we don't have a definitive constraint on whether x is below, at, or above z in terms of the y-coordinate.

Given that x is to the right of z and there's no definitive constraint on their vertical relationship, the possible cardinal direction relations are:

1. SE (South East): If supy(x) <= infy(z), which is possible based on the constraints.
2. E (East): If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which is possible based on the constraints.
3. NE (North East): If supy(z) <= infy(x), but this requires further analysis.

Let's dive deeper into the NE possibility.

If x is NE of z, then supy(z) <= infy(x). Here's a diagram of the situation we're considering:

```
      x x
      x x
   z z z
   z z z y y
   z z z y y
```

Now, given our constraints, is this arrangement possible?

From the constraints, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from "x is S of y")
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from "y is E of z")

In this arrangement, we want supy(z) <= infy(x).

Actually, I think I've been making things way too complicated. A concrete example will make this clearer:

Example 1:
z has bounds [0, 5] x [0, 10]
y has bounds [6, 8] x [4, 7]
x has bounds [7, 8] x [0, 3]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 3 <= infy(y) = 4, and x is horizontally contained within y.
- y is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6, and y is vertically contained within z.

and the relation between x and z is:
x is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 7, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 0, and supy(x) = 3 <= supy(z) = 10.

Example 2:
z has bounds [0, 5] x [4, 10]
y has bounds [6, 8] x [5, 7]
x has bounds [7, 8] x [0, 3]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 3 <= infy(y) = 5, and x is horizontally contained within y.
- y is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6, and y is vertically contained within z.

and the relation between x and z is:
x is SE of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 7 and supy(x) = 3 <= infy(z) = 4.

Example 3:
z has bounds [0, 5] x [0, 5]
y has bounds [6, 8] x [2, 4]
x has bounds [7, 8] x [6, 8]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 8 <= infy(y) = 2 (wait, this is wrong; it should be supy(x) > infy(y) for x to be S of y).

Let me just be precise about the constraints. I'll restate the question. Here are the cardinal direction relations provided:

- x is S of y means:
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is at or to the right of y's left edge)
  - supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is at or to the left of y's right edge)

- y is E of z means:
  - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom edge is at or above z's bottom edge)
  - supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top edge is at or below z's top edge)

Let me try to construct specific examples to represent the possible relations between x and z:

Example 1 (E relation):
z has bounds [0, 5] x [0, 10]
y has bounds [6, 8] x [3, 6]
x has bounds [7, 8] x [1, 2]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 3, infx(y) = 6 <= infx(x) = 7, and supx(x) = 8 <= supx(y) = 8.
- y is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 3, and supy(y) = 6 <= supy(z) = 10.

And the relation between x and z is:
x is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 7, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 1, and supy(x) = 2 <= supy(z) = 10.

Example 2 (SE relation):
z has bounds [0, 5] x [5, 10]
y has bounds [6, 8] x [3, 6]
x has bounds [7, 8] x [1, 2]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 3, infx(y) = 6 <= infx(x) = 7, and supx(x) = 8 <= supx(y) = 8.
- y is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6, infy(z) = 5 <= infy(y) = 3 (this seems incorrect; it should be infy(z) <= infy(y)), and supy(y) = 6 <= supy(z) = 10.

This example doesn't work because of the issue with infy(z) and infy(y). Let me correct it:

Example 2 (SE relation):
z has bounds [0, 5] x [3, 10]
y has bounds [6, 8] x [4, 6]
x has bounds [7, 8] x [1, 2]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 4, infx(y) = 6 <= infx(x) = 7, and supx(x) = 8 <= supx(y) = 8.
- y is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6, infy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 4, and supy(y) = 6 <= supy(z) = 10.

And the relation between x and z is:
x is SE of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 7 and supy(x) = 2 <= infy(z) = 3.

Now, let's consider the NE relation.

Example 3 (NE relation):
z has bounds [0, 5] x [0, 3]
y has bounds [6, 8] x [2, 3]
x has bounds [7, 8] x [5, 6]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 6 <= infy(y) = 2 (which is incorrect; it should be supy(x) <= infy(y) for x to be S of y).

Let's correct this:

Example 3 (NE relation):
z has bounds [0, 5] x [0, 3]
y has bounds [6, 8] x [5, 6]
x has bounds [7, 8] x [7, 8]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 8 <= infy(y) = 5 (which is incorrect; it should be supy(x) <= infy(y) for x to be S of y).

I think I'm making some mistake here. A region x is S of y if x's top y-coordinate is below (or at) y's bottom. This is the condition supy(x) <= infy(y). So, for example the top of x (say 8) is below (or equal to) the bottom of y (say 10): 8 <= 10.

Let's try again for the NE relation:

Example 3 (NE relation):
z has bounds [0, 5] x [0, 3]
y has bounds [6, 8] x [5, 8]
x has bounds [7, 8] x [9, 10]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 10 <= infy(y) = 5 (which is incorrect; it should be supy(x) <= infy(y) for x to be S of y).

I'm confused about the condition for "S of". Let me double-check the definition:

S (South): a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

So, for "a is S of b", the top of a must be below (or at) the bottom of b, and a must be horizontally contained within b.

Let me try to get the NE relation one more time

Example 3 (NE relation):
z has bounds [0, 5] x [0, 5]
y has bounds [6, 8] x [4, 5]
x has bounds [7, 8] x [6, 8]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 8 <= infy(y) = 4 (which is incorrect; it should be supy(x) <= infy(y) for x to be S of y).

Let me recheck the definition of S and reconsider the constraints carefully.

S (South): a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

So, "a is S of b" means a is below b, and a is horizontally contained within b.

In our problem, we have "x is S of y", which means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

Ok, I need to be even more careful. "supy(x) <= infy(y)" means the top (maximum y-value) of x is below or at the bottom (minimum y-value) of y. Like this:
```
   y y y
   y y y
   x x x
   x x x
```
where the top of x (the horizontal line at the top of the x block) is below the bottom of y (the horizontal line at the bottom of the y block).

I've been incorrectly trying to satisfy "supy(x) <= infy(y)" with examples where the top of x is above the bottom of y.

Let me restart with the correct understanding.

In our problem, "x is S of y" and "y is E of z". Let's try to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

From "x is S of y", we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (the top of x is below or at the bottom of y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left of x is to the right or at the left of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right of x is to the left or at the right of y)

From "y is E of z", we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (the right of z is to the left or at the left of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (the bottom of y is above or at the bottom of z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (the top of y is below or at the top of z)

Now, combining these constraints, we can deduce that supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means that x is to the right of z. This is a necessary condition for SE, E, and NE.

Let's consider the vertical constraint for each of these relations:

1. SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) (the top of x is below or at the bottom of z).
   From our constraints, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). These don't give us a definitive relation between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible to have both supy(x) <= infy(z) (making SE valid) and supy(x) > infy(z) (making SE invalid). So, SE is a potential relation.

2. E (East): For x to be E of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is above or at the bottom of z) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is below or at the top of z).
   We can't definitively determine if infy(z) <= infy(x) given our constraints, and the same goes for supy(x) <= supy(z). So, E is also a potential relation.

3. NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) (the top of z is below or at the bottom of x).
   We have infy(y) >= supy(x) (from "x is S of y") and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from "y is E of z"). These constraints are compatible with supy(z) <= infy(x) (the condition for NE) simply because supy(x) <= infy(y) doesn't directly constrain supy(z) relative to infy(x). So, NE is also a potential relation.

Ok, I think I've finally got this nailed. I'll just create some examples to double-check.

Example 1 (SE relation):
Region z has bounds [0, 5] x [8, 10]
Region y has bounds [6, 8] x [6, 8]
Region x has bounds [7, 8] x [3, 5]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 5 <= infy(y) = 6, infx(y) = 6 <= infx(x) = 7, and supx(x) = 8 <= supx(y) = 8.
- y is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6, infy(z) = 8 <= infy(y) = 6 (this is incorrect; it should be the other way around), and supy(y) = 8 <= supy(z) = 10.

Let me correct this:

Example 1 (SE relation):
Region z has bounds [0, 5] x [6, 10]
Region y has bounds [6, 8] x [6, 8]
Region x has bounds [7, 8] x [3, 5]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 5 <= infy(y) = 6, infx(y) = 6 <= infx(x) = 7, and supx(x) = 8 <= supx(y) = 8.
- y is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6, infy(z) = 6 <= infy(y) = 6, and supy(y) = 8 <= supy(z) = 10.

And the relation between x and z is:
x is SE of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 7 and supy(x) = 5 <= infy(z) = 6.

Example 2 (E relation):
Region z has bounds [0, 5] x [3, 10]
Region y has bounds [6, 8] x [6, 8]
Region x has bounds [7, 8] x [4, 5]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 5 <= infy(y) = 6, infx(y) = 6 <= infx(x) = 7, and supx(x) = 8 <= supx(y) = 8.
- y is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6, infy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 6, and supy(y) = 8 <= supy(z) = 10.

And the relation between x and z is:
x is E of z because: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 7, infy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) = 4, and supy(x) = 5 <= supy(z) = 10.

Example 3 (NE relation):
Region z has bounds [0, 5] x [0, 3]
Region y has bounds [6, 8] x [3, 5]
Region x has bounds [7, 8] x [6, 7]

In this example:
- x is S of y because: supy(x) = 7 <= infy(y) = 3 (this is incorrect; it should be the other way around).

Ok, I'm going to slow down and be super careful because I keep making a very silly mistake. Let's define the regions once more:

- S (South): a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- E (East): a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

Given "x is S of y", we have supy(x) <= infy(y), which means the top of x is below (or at) the bottom of y. So, x is below y. Also, infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), which means x is horizontally contained within y.

Given "y is E of z", we have supx(z) <= infx(y), which means the right of z is to the left (or at) the left of y. So, y is to the right of z. Also, infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means y is vertically contained within z.

Finally let's verify our final answer. We've determined that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: SE, E, and NE.

1. SE: supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z).
   Do the constraints of "x is S of y" and "y is E of z" ensure this will always be true? No, because while we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (ensuring x is to the right of z), we don't have a guarantee that supy(x) <= infy(z).

2. E: supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z), infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is above or at the bottom of z), and supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is below or at the top of z).
   Do the constraints of "x is S of y" and "y is E of z" ensure this will always be true? No, because while we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (ensuring x is to the right of z), we don't have guarantees for the other two conditions.

3. NE: supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z).
   Do the constraints of "x is S of y" and "y is E of z" ensure this will always be true? No, because while we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (ensuring x is to the right of z), we don't have a guarantee that supy(z) <= infy(x).

So, the possible relations are SE, E, and NE. I simply nead to confirm this with a concrete counter-example: e.g. if the relation is currently SE, I want to change the regions to make it E. Similarly, if the relation is E, I want to change the regions to make it NE. Let me try to cover a few scenarios with concrete numbers to convince myself.

Scenario 1 (SE relation):
Region z with bounds [0, 5] x [5, 10]
Region y with bounds [6, 8] x [5, 8]
Region x with bounds [7, 8] x [2, 4]

In this scenario:
- x is S of y: supy(x) = 4 <= infy(y) = 5 (top of x is below the bottom of y), and x is horizontally contained within y.
- y is E of z: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6 (y is to the right of z), and y is vertically contained within z.
- x is SE of z: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 7 (x is to the right of z) and supy(x) = 4 <= infy(z) = 5 (x is below z).

Scenario 2 (E relation):
Region z with bounds [0, 5] x [2, 10]
Region y with bounds [6, 8] x [5, 8]
Region x with bounds [7, 8] x [3, 4]

In this scenario:
- x is S of y: supy(x) = 4 <= infy(y) = 5 (top of x is below the bottom of y), and x is horizontally contained within y.
- y is E of z: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6 (y is to the right of z), and y is vertically contained within z.
- x is E of z: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 7 (x is to the right of z), infy(z) = 2 <= infy(x) = 3 (bottom of x is above the bottom of z), and supy(x) = 4 <= supy(z) = 10 (top of x is below the top of z).

Scenario 3 (NE relation):
Region z with bounds [0, 5] x [0, 2]
Region y with bounds [6, 8] x [2, 4]
Region x with bounds [7, 8] x [5, 6]

In this scenario:
- x is S of y: supy(x) = 6 <= infy(y) = 2 (this is incorrect; the top of x should be below the bottom of y).

Let me correct this:

Scenario 3 (NE relation):
Region z with bounds [0, 5] x [0, 2]
Region y with bounds [6, 8] x [3, 4]
Region x with bounds [7, 8] x [5, 6]

In this scenario:
- x is S of y: supy(x) = 6 <= infy(y) = 3 (this is still incorrect; the top of x should be below the bottom of y).

Ok let's fix this one more time by going back to basics. "x is S of y" means supy(x) <= infy(y), i.e., the top of x is below or at the bottom of y.

Scenario 3 (NE relation):
Region z with bounds [0, 5] x [0, 2]
Region y with bounds [6, 8] x [3, 4]
Region x with bounds [7, 8] x [0, 2]

In this scenario:
- x is S of y: supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 3 (top of x is below the bottom of y), and x is horizontally contained within y.
- y is E of z: supx(z) = 5 <= infx(y) = 6 (y is to the right of z), and y is vertically contained within z.
- But x is not NE of z because supy(z) = 2 is not <= infy(x) = 0. Instead, x is E of z.

Let me try one more time for NE:

Scenario 3 (NE relation):
Region z with bounds [0, 5] x [0, 2]
Region y with bounds [6, 8] x [4, 6]
Region x with bounds [7, 8] x [7, 8]

In this scenario:
- x is S of y: supy(x) = 8 <= infy(y) = 4 (this is incorrect; the top of x should be below the bottom of y).

I think I'm making a conceptual mistake. Let's clarify what the S relation means one more time:

S (South): a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For "a is S of b", the top of a (supy(a)) is below or at the bottom of b (infy(b)). In other words, a is below b. The conditions infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) indicate that a is horizontally contained within b.

For the NE relation, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

Given our constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (ensuring x is to the right of z). But for the second condition, we'd need something like supy(z) <= infy(x), and there's no direct guarantee of this from our given constraints.

However, let's think about this. We have "x is S of y", which means supy(x) <= infy(y). We also have "y is E of z", which means (among other things) supy(y) <= supy(z).

But these two don't give us a direct relation between supy(z) and infy(x). It's possible to have supy(z) <= infy(x) (making NE valid) or supy(z) > infy(x) (making NE invalid).

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this problem. Let me just focus on the main question: What are the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z given "x is S of y" and "y is E of z"?

Given our constraints, we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which ensures that x is to the right of z.

Now, let's consider the vertical relationship, which will determine whether it's SE, E, or NE:

1. SE: We need supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z).
   From our constraints, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) (from "x is S of y") and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from "y is E of z"). We can't guarantee that supy(x) <= infy(z) from these. It's possible for x to be both below z (making SE valid) and not below z (making SE invalid). So, SE is a possible relation.

2. E: We need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x vertically contained within z).
   Given our constraints, we can't guarantee these conditions. E is a possible relation.

3. NE: We need supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z).
   Given our constraints, we can't guarantee this condition. NE is a possible relation.

But let's be 100% careful by thinking about what the constraints do directly tell us.

Let's say we have:
```
     y
    x
```
Where x is below y. We also have:
```
z
 y
```
Where y is to the right of z.

Combined, we'd have something like:
```
z
 y
  x
```
Or:
```
z y
   x
```
Or even:
```
z
 y
   x
```

Depending on how z is placed relative to y, and how x is placed relative to y, we could have any of the three relations: SE, E, or NE. The key insight is that while the constraints ensure x is to the right of z, they don't fully constrain the vertical relationship between x and z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: SE, E, and NE.

I've thought about this problem in-depth and I'm confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

# Analyzing the Possible Relations between Region x and Region z

Given information:
- Region x is S (South) of region y
- Region y is E (East) of region z

To determine the possible relations between x and z, I'll analyze the constraints from the given relations.

## From the definitions:

When x is S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is horizontally contained within y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

When y is E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is vertically contained within z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

## Analysis:

From these constraints, we can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
This means x must be to the right of z, which is a necessary condition for SE, E, and NE relations.

However, the vertical relationship between x and z isn't fully constrained:
- We have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- These don't determine if x is below, overlapping with, or above z

## Possible relations:

SE, E, NE
