For r1: N, r2: N, answer: Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, I'll determine what relations are possible between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y
- y is N of z

For x to be N of y, we have:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

For y to be N of z, we have:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these, we can deduce:
1. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

These three conditions mean x is N of z.

Additionally, x could be:
- NW of z (if x is entirely to the west of z while still being north)
- NE of z (if x is entirely to the east of z while still being north)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NW, NE.
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: Based on the constraints given, I'll analyze the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is W of region z

From these constraints, I can derive the following:

From x N y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (left edge of x is constrained by y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (right edge of x is constrained by y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (bottom edge of y is constrained by z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (top edge of y is constrained by z)

Combining these constraints:
1. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   This proves x is entirely to the left of z

2. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   This proves the bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z

Based on these derivations, x must be to the left of z, but its vertical relationship with z could vary. Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

NW, W
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is E of region z

From the first statement, x is North of y, which means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From the second statement, y is East of z, which means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Analyzing what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. From supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x), we can derive:
   supx(z) <= infx(x)
   
2. From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we can derive:
   infy(z) <= infy(x)

Let me check each possible relation:

- For NE: We need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x). The second condition is satisfied, and the first condition can be satisfied depending on the exact positions.

- For E: We need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two conditions are satisfied, and the third can be satisfied depending on the regions' exact heights.

Other directions like N, S, W, SW, SE, NW, and B are not possible because they contradict our derived constraints.

NE, E
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the logical consequences of the given information.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is S of region z

From the definition of N (North):
- x N y means: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From the definition of S (South):
- y S z means: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

This means x is "inside" z with respect to x-coordinates (the projection of x onto the x-axis is contained within the projection of z).

However, for y-coordinates, we only know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

These constraints allow for multiple possibilities for the relation between x and z:

1. N: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), x is completely above z
2. S: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is completely below z
3. B: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), x is inside z's bounding box
4. N:B: If part of x is north of z and part is inside z's bounding box
5. B:S: If part of x is inside z's bounding box and part is south of z

The possible relations are: N, S, B, N:B, B:S
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From x N y, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (left alignment)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (right alignment)

From y NW z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x is above z.
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is to the left of z.

When a region is both above and to the left of another region, it is in the NW direction relative to that region.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y
- y is SW of z

From "x is N of y," I know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally aligned with y)

From "y is SW of z," I know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

This means x must be to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).

However, the vertical relationship between x and z can vary:
1. x could be north of z (NW relation)
2. x could overlap vertically with z (W relation)
3. x could be south of z (SW relation)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, SW
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: Based on the constraints that region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y, meaning: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is SE of z, meaning: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, I can derive that:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x is always to the east of z

The y-coordinate relationship between x and z can vary:
1. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x): x is NE of z
2. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z): x is E of z
3. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is SE of z

All three scenarios are possible while maintaining the original constraints.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, SE
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is North of region y, and region y is Northeast of region z.

First, let me recall the definitions:
- x N y means: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's analyze what these constraints tell us about the position of x relative to z:

**Vertical relationship:**
- From y NE z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- By transitivity: supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
This tells us x is above z.

**Horizontal relationship:**
- From y NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- From x N y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- By transitivity: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
This tells us z is to the left of x (or x is to the right of z).

Given that x is above z and x is to the right of z, I need to check if this satisfies the definition of NE:
- For x NE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- Both conditions are met based on our analysis above.

Let me verify no other cardinal direction is possible:
- N requires horizontal overlap, but we've established z is strictly to the left of x
- NW requires x to be to the left of z, but we know x is to the right of z
- Other directions (E, SE, S, SW, W, B) all contradict our established constraints

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: NE
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: Based on the given relations (x is N of y and y is B of z), I'll determine the possible relations between regions x and z by analyzing the constraints.

When x is N of y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (horizontal constraint)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (horizontal constraint)

When y is B of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (horizontal constraint)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (horizontal constraint)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (vertical constraint)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (vertical constraint)

Combining these constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom is above z's bottom)

For a region x to be N of z:
- We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- The horizontal conditions are satisfied, but supy(z) ≤ infy(x) depends on how high z extends

For x to be B of z:
- We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- The first three conditions are satisfied, but supy(x) ≤ supy(z) depends on how high x and z extend

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
N, B
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Based on the given constraints:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is N of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

For x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is entirely to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y-projection containment)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y-projection containment)

For y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is entirely above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (x-projection containment)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (x-projection containment)

Combining these constraints:
- From y N z and x W y: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
This means region z is entirely below region x.

However, we can't establish a definite relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z. This means x could be:

1. NW of z (if x is entirely to the left of z)
2. N of z (if x-projection of x overlaps with that of z)
3. NE of z (if x is entirely to the right of z)

The answer is: NW, N, NE
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: Based on the given information:
- region x is W of region y
- region y is W of region z

Let me analyze what this means:

When x is W of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (vertical constraint)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (vertical constraint)

When y is W of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (vertical constraint)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (vertical constraint)

From these conditions, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z)

The possible relations between x and z are:
- W (if x and z have overlapping vertical extents)
- NW (if x is above z)
- SW (if x is below z)

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: W, NW, SW
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: Looking at the given information:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is E of region z

Let me analyze what each relation tells us:

For "x W y":
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the west of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y's y-extent contains x's y-extent)

For "y E z":
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is completely to the west of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z's y-extent contains y's y-extent)

Combining these constraints:
- Both x and z are to the west of y
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
  (x's y-extent is contained within z's y-extent)

In the x-direction, we know x and z are both west of y, but we don't know their position relative to each other. 

Given all this, the possible relations between x and z are:
W, E, B
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Based on the given information:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is S of region z

I need to determine possible relations between x and z.

Let me analyze what these constraints mean:

For x W y:
- x is entirely to the left of y
- x's vertical extent is within y's vertical extent

For y S z:
- y is entirely below z
- y's horizontal extent is within z's horizontal extent

From these constraints, I can determine:
- Since x's vertical extent is within y's, and y is entirely below z, then x must also be entirely below z
- Horizontally, x is to the left of y, while y is horizontally contained within z

This means x can be:
- SW of z (if x is horizontally to the left of z and below it)
- S of z (if x horizontally overlaps with z and is below it)

No other cardinal direction is possible because:
- x cannot be vertically aligned with z (ruling out W)
- x cannot be to the right of z (ruling out SE)
- x is definitely below z (ruling out N, NW, NE, E, B)

The possible relations between x and z are:
SW, S
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction definitions, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From "x W y", we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top boundary is at or below y's top boundary)

From "y NW z", we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

Analyzing the x-coordinate relationship:
From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can derive supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Analyzing the y-coordinate relationship:
From infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), we can derive supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is below x.

Since x is to the left of z and z is below x, the only possible relation is:

NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: The cardinal direction relations between region x and region z can be determined by analyzing the constraints.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of y is lower than or equal to bottom of x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x is lower than or equal to top of y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (top of y is below bottom of z)

Combining these conditions:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These conditions precisely satisfy the definition of SW: 
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

The only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given constraints:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Let me determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

First, I'll analyze what these constraints tell us:
- x W y means x is to the west of y and vertically aligned with y's extent
- y SE z means y is to the southeast of z (both east and south of z)

From these constraints:
- Since x is to the west of y, and y is to the east of z, x could be southwest, south, or southeast of z depending on the exact horizontal placement of x relative to z.
- Since y is to the south of z, and x's vertical extent is contained within y's vertical extent, x must be south of z.

Let me check each possible relation:

SW (Southwest): 
- Possible if x is positioned west of both y and z while being south of z.

S (South):
- Possible if x is directly below z (overlapping with z's projection on the x-axis).

SE (Southeast):
- Possible if x is east of z but west of y, while being south of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, and SE.
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction constraints:

1. When x is W of y, we know:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom is below or at x's bottom)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is below or at y's top)

2. When y is NE of z, we know:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's top is below y's bottom)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
- Both x and z are to the left of y
- Since supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is completely below x

However, we cannot determine the exact horizontal relationship between x and z - x could be to the left of z, overlapping with z, or to the right of z in terms of x-coordinates.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (if x is to the left of z)
- N (if x is directly above z)
- NE (if x is to the right of z)
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z could be: W, SW, S, B

Let me explain why:

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, we can derive:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

The N, NW, NE, E, and SE relations are impossible because:
- For N, NW, NE: We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but our constraints give us infy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- For E, SE: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but our constraints give us infx(x) ≤ supx(z)

This leaves W, SW, S, and B as the only possible relations.
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to carefully analyze the constraints from the given information.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the definition of E (East):
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's southern boundary is aligned with or north of y's southern boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's northern boundary is aligned with or south of y's northern boundary)

From the definition of N (North):
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's western boundary is aligned with or east of z's western boundary)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's eastern boundary is aligned with or west of z's eastern boundary)

Analyzing possible relations between x and z:

NW, W, SW are impossible because:
- From our constraints, infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- This implies infx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicting the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for these directions

B is impossible because:
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- This means z's top is below x's bottom, contradicting the requirement supy(x) ≤ supy(z) for B

The possible relations are:
N, NE, E, SE, S
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal direction relations are possible between regions x and z, given the constraints that x is E of y and y is W of z.

From "x is E of y," I can derive:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is strictly to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of y is at or below bottom of x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x is at or below top of y)

From "y is W of z," I can derive:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is strictly to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (bottom of z is at or below bottom of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (top of y is at or below top of z)

Combining these constraints, I can derive:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (transitively through y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (transitively through y)

Now I'll check each possible cardinal direction relation between x and z:

For E: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
The y-constraints are already satisfied, and the x-constraint is possible. So E is possible.

For W: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
The y-constraints are already satisfied, and the x-constraint is possible. So W is possible.

For B: Requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
The y-constraints are already satisfied, and the x-constraints are possible. So B is possible.

For N, S, NE, SE, NW, SW: These all require constraints that contradict our derived y-constraints, making them impossible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: E, W, B
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: Based on the given information:
- x E y (x is East of y)
- y E z (y is East of z)

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relation(s) between x and z.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y extends at least as far south as x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y extends at least as far north as x)

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Combining these constraints:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means z is to the west of x
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means z extends at least as far south as x
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means z extends at least as far north as x

These three conditions precisely match the definition of x E z.

The answer is: E
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Based on the given relations:
- x is E of y
- y is S of z

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From "x is E of y":
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is completely to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-range is within y's y-range)

From "y is S of z":
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is completely below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-range is within z's x-range)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so x is below z
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), so the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as the left edge of z

The possible relations are:

1. S: When x is below z and x's x-range is within z's x-range
   This happens when: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)

2. SE: When x is below z and completely to the right of z
   This happens when: supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x)

S, SE
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

Let me analyze the constraints:

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's vertical projection is within y's projection)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

In the north-south dimension:
- From the constraints above: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- This means x is definitely to the north of z

In the east-west dimension:
- Both x and z are to the east of y
- But their relative positions to each other are not constrained

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- NW (if x is to the west of z)
- N (if x overlaps with z in the east-west dimension)
- NE (if x is to the east of z)
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means region x is completely below region z in the y-coordinate. However, I cannot determine a definitive relation between x and z in the x-coordinate.

Given that x is completely below z, and considering all possible x-coordinate relationships, the possible relations between x and z are:

S, SE, SW
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I'll analyze the constraints from the given relations.

Given:
- x is E of y
- y is SE of z

Step 1: Let's analyze what these relations tell us.

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x vertically overlaps with y)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Step 2: Determine the horizontal relationship between x and z.
Combining the relevant constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z.

Step 3: Determine the vertical relationship between x and z.
From the constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means the top of x is below the bottom of z, so x is to the south of z.

Step 4: Combine the horizontal and vertical relationships.
Since x is both east of z and south of z, the only possible relation is SE.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is SE.
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine what cardinal direction relation(s) can hold between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is E of y
- y is NE of z

Step 1: Analyze what these relations tell us.
- x E y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Step 2: Determine constraints on x relative to z.
From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  (x is to the right of z)

From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)  (x is above z)

Step 3: Match these constraints to cardinal direction definitions.
The constraints supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) exactly match the definition of the NE relation:
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)

Answer: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: The question requires me to determine which cardinal direction relations could hold between region x and region z, given that:
- region x is E of region y
- region y is B of region z

Let me analyze what these given relations tell us:

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x doesn't extend below y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x doesn't extend above y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y doesn't extend left of z)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y doesn't extend right of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y doesn't extend below z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend above z)

Combining these constraints:
- For y-coordinates: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
  This means x is within the y-range of z.
- For x-coordinates: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
  This means x is to the right of y, and y is within the x-range of z.

Based on these constraints, there are two possible relations between x and z:

1. E (East): When supx(z) < infx(x)
   In this case, x is strictly to the right of z.

2. B (Bounding box): When infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   In this case, x is completely within the bounds of z.

All other cardinal directions (N, NE, SE, S, SW, W, NW) are ruled out by our constraints.
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Looking at the constraints:
- Region x is S of region y: This means x is south of y, with x's top boundary below y's bottom boundary, and x's left-right extent within y's left-right extent.
- Region y is N of region z: This means y is north of z, with z's top boundary below y's bottom boundary, and y's left-right extent within z's left-right extent.

From these constraints, I can derive:
- For x-coordinates: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- For y-coordinates: Both x and z are below y, but their vertical relationship with each other is not constrained

The possible relations between x and z are:

1. S (South): If x's top boundary is below z's bottom boundary
2. N (North): If z's top boundary is below x's bottom boundary
3. B (Bounding Box): If x and z overlap vertically while x remains within z's horizontal extent

The regions cannot have SW, W, NW, SE, E, or NE relations because these would contradict the horizontal constraints we derived.
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x S y (region x is South of region y)
- y W z (region y is West of region z)

From these relations, I can derive:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

This means region x is definitely to the west of region z. However, the vertical relationship is not fully constrained.

The possible relations are:
- SW (if region x is below region z)
- W (if regions x and z have vertical overlap)
- NW (if region x is above region z)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, W, NW.
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: # Analyzing the Possible Relations between Region x and Region z

Given information:
- Region x is S (South) of region y
- Region y is E (East) of region z

To determine the possible relations between x and z, I'll analyze the constraints from the given relations.

## From the definitions:

When x is S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is horizontally contained within y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

When y is E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is vertically contained within z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

## Analysis:

From these constraints, we can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
This means x must be to the right of z, which is a necessary condition for SE, E, and NE relations.

However, the vertical relationship between x and z isn't fully constrained:
- We have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- These don't determine if x is below, overlapping with, or above z

## Possible relations:

SE, E, NE
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Based on the definitions, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z given that x is S of y and y is S of z.

Given information:
- x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Analyzing what these imply for the relationship between x and z:

1. For the y-dimension:
   From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   From y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   Therefore: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

2. For the x-dimension:
   From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   From y S z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
   Therefore: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

These derived conditions (supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) precisely match the definition of the South relation.

For any other cardinal direction relation to hold between x and z, additional constraints would need to be satisfied, but these would contradict our derived conditions.

Therefore, S is the only possible relation between region x and region z.
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, W, and NW.

When region x is S of region y:
- x is below y
- x is within y's horizontal extent

When region y is NW of region z:
- y is to the left of z
- y is above z

From these conditions:
1. Horizontally: Since x is within y's horizontal extent and y is to the left of z, x must be to the left of z.
2. Vertically: Both x and z are below y, but their vertical relationship with each other is undetermined.

Since x is definitely to the left of z, but can be below, overlapping vertically, or above z, the three possible relations are SW, W, and NW.
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions of cardinal directions, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From "x is S of y":
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) [x is below y]
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [left boundary constraint]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) [right boundary constraint]

From "y is SW of z":
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) [y is below z]

From these, I can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is entirely below z

These two deductions together match exactly the definition of the SW relation:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: The question asks about the possible relations between region x and region z, given that:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

I'll analyze the constraints from these two given relations:

From "x S y":
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or at the same position as y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as y's right edge)

From "y SE z":
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

For the vertical relationship between x and z:
- From the constraints: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z

For the horizontal relationship between x and z:
- From the constraints: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- Therefore, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the right of z

Since x is both below and to the right of z, the only possible relation is:

SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is S of y and y is NE of z.

Let me analyze the constraints:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's west side is not west of y's west side)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's east side is not east of y's east side)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x must be east of z
- For the north-south relationship, we can't directly determine it from these constraints

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- E (East) - if x is directly east of z
- SE (Southeast) - if x is southeast of z
- NE (Northeast) - if x is northeast of z
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: 
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: The cardinal directions "NW of" and "N of" describe specific spatial relationships between regions. I need to determine what's possible when we have these constraints:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the definitions:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For the possible relations between x and z:

1. N: Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - We've shown supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) are true
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is possible in some arrangements

2. NW: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We've shown supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is true
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible in some arrangements

The answer is: N, NW
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: The question asks for possible relations between region x and region z, given:
- x is NW of y
- y is W of z

I'll analyze what these constraints tell us and determine the possible cardinal direction relations.

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is completely below x)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (bottom of z is below or at same level as bottom of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (top of y is below or at same level as top of z)

Combining these constraints:
- From the first constraints of each relation: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can conclude by transitivity that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So x must be completely to the left of z.
- From y W z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and from x NW y, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x). This gives us infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Let's check which cardinal directions are possible:

1. NW: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The first condition is satisfied, and the second is possible.
2. W: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The first two conditions are satisfied, and the third is possible.

SW is not possible because it would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we've established infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means the bottom of z is below the bottom of x, contradicting the SW requirement.

The possible relations are: NW, W
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: Based on the constraints given, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, when x is NW of y and y is E of z.

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints:
1. We know x is to the west and north of y
2. We know y is to the east of z with its vertical extent contained within z's

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

NW: When x is completely to the west and north of z
N: When x is directly north of z with horizontal overlap
NE: When x is to the north and east of z
W: When x is directly west of z with vertical overlap
B: When x is contained within z's bounding box
E: When x is directly east of z with vertical overlap

The answer is: NW, N, NE, W, B, E
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is S of region z

When x is NW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is entirely to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely above y)

When y is S of z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is entirely below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-extent is contained within z's x-extent)

Let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. NW: x can be northwest of z if both x is to the left of z and above z
2. N: x can be north of z if x is directly above z and within z's x-extent
3. W: x can be west of z if x is to the left of z and its y-extent overlaps with z's y-extent
4. SW: x can be southwest of z if x is to the left of z and below z

The constraints don't allow for the other cardinal directions (NE, E, SE, S, B) because:
- x must be to the left of y (from x NW of y)
- y's x-extent is within z's x-extent (from y S of z)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, N, W, SW.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: Looking at the definitions and constraints:

When region x is NW of region y, this means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is entirely to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of y)

Similarly, when region y is NW of region z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is entirely to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is entirely to the north of z)

Through transitivity:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), therefore supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), therefore supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These derived constraints (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) exactly match the definition of the NW relation.

None of the other cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B) are possible because they would require conditions that contradict our derived constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

By transitivity, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This means x must be strictly to the west of z, which narrows the possible relations to NW, W, and SW.

Let's check if each is consistent with our constraints:

1. NW: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
2. W: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
3. SW: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

None of these y-coordinate constraints are contradicted by our given information, so all three relations are possible.

The answer is: NW, W, SW
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is NW of y, which means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SE of z, which means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
1. Both x and z are to the left of y (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
2. Both x and z are above y (since supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

However, the relative positions of x and z to each other are not constrained by this information. They could be positioned in any arrangement while still satisfying the given conditions.

Therefore, all cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Using the definitions:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, I can derive:
- From y NE z, we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- From x NW y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Combining these: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

This establishes that z is strictly south of x. However, the east-west relationship between x and z is not determined by the given constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations are:
NW, N, NE
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal direction relationships are possible between region x and region z, based on the given constraints: "x is NW of y" and "y is B of z".

From the definitions:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  (x is completely to the northwest of y)
- y B z means: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
  (y is completely within the bounding box of z)

Let me analyze each possible direction relationship between x and z:

1. NW: Possible if z doesn't extend too far west or north beyond y
2. N: Possible if z extends west beyond x's position
3. W: Possible if z extends north beyond x's position 
4. B: Possible if z extends both west and north enough to include x

5. NE, E, SE: Not possible because x is to the left of y (which is inside z), so x cannot be entirely to the right of z
6. S, SW: Not possible because x is above y (which is inside z), so x cannot be entirely below z

The possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, B
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine what relations are possible between regions x and z given that x is SW of y and y is N of z.

Let's analyze what we know:
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

For each possible relation between x and z, I'll check if it's consistent with these constraints:

NE, E, SE: These are impossible because we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts the requirement that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for any eastern relation.

For the remaining relations:

B: Possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

S: Possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

SW: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

W: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

NW: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

N: Possible if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

The possible relations between x and z are: B, S, SW, W, NW, N
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

First, let me analyze what we know:
- x is SW of y, meaning: 
  * supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
  * supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

- y is W of z, meaning:
  * supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
  * infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y extends at least as far south as z)
  * supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

From these constraints, I can deduce:
1. For east-west positioning: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is west of z.

2. For north-south positioning:
   - We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
   - We know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z doesn't extend as far south as y)
   - We know supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z to the north)

Based on these constraints, the possible relations are:

SW: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is entirely south of z, making the relation SW.

W: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is west of z with its north-south extent contained within z's extent, making the relation W.

The constraints don't allow for any other single-tile relation between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: W, SW
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is SW of y and y is E of z.

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:

For x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as low as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as high as y)

From these constraints:
- Both x and z are to the left of y
- x is below y
- z extends vertically to include at least the entire vertical extent of y

Checking each possible relation:
- N, NE, NW: Not possible because z extends vertically at least as high as y, and y is above x
- E: Possible if x is to the right of z with vertical overlap
- SE: Possible if x is to the right and below z
- S: Possible if x is directly below z with horizontal overlap
- SW: Possible if x is to the left and below z
- W: Possible if x is to the left of z with vertical overlap
- B: Possible if x is within the bounding box of z

The possible relations are: E, SE, S, SW, W, B
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: 
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: From the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

Let me analyze what these tell us:

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

From these constraints:
- By transitivity from the horizontal constraints: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z
- The vertical relationship between x and z is not fully determined by the given constraints

Since x is to the left of z, and can be below, at the same level as, or above z (or any combination thereof), the possible relations are:

SW, W, NW, SW:W, W:NW, SW:W:NW
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information, I'll analyze the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is SW of z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This simplifies to:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Looking at the cardinal direction definitions, these conditions exactly match the definition of the SW relation: a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is:

SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

S, SW, SE

I'll explain why:

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- Region y is SE of region z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is definitely south of z

For the east-west relationship:
- Both x and z are to the left of y (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
- But their relative positions to each other can vary:
  * If supx(x) ≤ infx(z): x is SW of z
  * If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z): x is S of z
  * If supx(z) ≤ infx(x): x is SE of z

No other cardinal direction is possible because all others would violate the condition that x must be south of z.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

This means:
- For x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- For y NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These constraints tell us that both x and z are "southwest" of y in a general sense, but they don't directly constrain the relationship between x and z.

Let me check various possible configurations:

1. x could be SW of z: 
   - Example: z at (1,1), y at (3,3), x at (0,0)

2. x could be W of z:
   - Example: z at (1,0), y at (3,3), x at (0,1)

3. x could be NW of z:
   - Example: z at (1,0), y at (3,3), x at (0,2)

4. x could be N of z:
   - Example: z at (0,0), y at (3,3), x at (1,2)

5. x could be NE of z:
   - Example: z at (0,0), y at (5,5), x at (2,2)

6. x could be E of z:
   - Example: z at (0,1), y at (3,3), x at (2,1)

7. x could be SE of z:
   - Example: z at (0,1), y at (3,3), x at (2,0)

8. x could be S of z:
   - Example: z at (0,1), y at (3,3), x at (1,0)

9. x could be B of z:
   - Example: z spans (0,0) to (3,3), y at (5,5), x spans (1,1) to (2,2)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Based on the given information:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is B of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is entirely to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is entirely to the south of y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Possible relations between x and z:

1. SW: If z doesn't extend far enough west or south to reach x
2. W: If z extends south to overlap with x's y-range but not west enough
3. S: If z extends west to overlap with x's x-range but not south enough
4. B: If z extends both west and south enough to contain x entirely

The relations N, NE, E, SE, and NW are not possible because x is SW of y, and z must contain y within its bounding box.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, W, S, B.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is N of z

First, let me analyze what these relations tell us:
- x SE y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can determine:
- x is east of y (since supx(y) ≤ infx(x))
- x is south of y (since supy(x) ≤ infy(y))
- y is north of z (since supy(z) ≤ infy(y))
- z extends at least as far west and east as y does

The possible relations between x and z are:

N, NE, E, SE, S, B

The impossible relations are NW, W, and SW, because these would require x to be west of z, which contradicts our constraints (since x is east of y, and z extends at least as far east as y).
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: To determine the possible cardinal directions between region x and region z based on the given relations, I'll analyze the constraints systematically.

Given information:
- x is SE of y
- y is W of z

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (z is to the east of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z can extend below y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z can extend above y)

Analyzing the possible positions of x relative to z:

East-West positioning:
- Both x and z are to the east of y, but their relative positions are not fixed
- x could be west of z, east of z, or they could overlap in the east-west direction

North-South positioning:
- x is entirely below y
- z can extend below y (since infy(z) ≤ infy(y))
- Therefore, x can be entirely below z, or x and z can overlap in the north-south direction

Combining these possibilities, the possible cardinal relations between x and z are:

S, SW, SE, W, E, B
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: The given conditions are:
- x SE y
- y E z

To determine the possible relations between x and z, I need to analyze the constraints these conditions impose.

From x SE y:
- x is to the east of y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- x is to the south of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

From y E z:
- y is to the east of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- y's y-range is within z's y-range: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- This means x must be to the east of z

For the y-coordinate relationship, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z's y-range includes y's)

Based on these constraints, x could be:
- To the south of z (SE relation)
- Neither north nor south of z (E relation)
- To the north of z (NE relation)

The possible relations are: E, SE, NE
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is S of region z

First, I'll analyze what these relations tell us:

From x SE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is within the x-bounds of z)

For the north-south relation:
- By transitivity: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

For the east-west relation:
- From the constraints: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- This means infx(z) ≤ infx(x), so x either starts after z starts or at the same point.

Now, I need to determine the possible cardinal directions:

1. S is possible if:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which we've shown is true)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   
2. SE is possible if:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which we've shown is true)
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

Both of these relations are possible because we can't establish a definitive relationship between supx(x) and supx(z) from the given constraints.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SE
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

For x SE y, this means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For y NW z, this means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

These constraints don't fully determine the relative position of x and z. By carefully examining possible configurations that satisfy both constraints, I can determine that x and z could be in any of the following cardinal direction relations:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B

All 9 possible cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From these, I can derive:

1. Since x is SE of y:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. Since y is SW of z:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means x is definitely to the south of z. However, the east-west relationship between x and z is not directly constrained.

Therefore, the possible relations are:
- S (if x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection)
- SE (if x is to the east of z)
- SW (if x is to the west of z)

The answer is: S, SE, SW
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, I'll analyze what's possible when region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z.

First, let me recall what these relations mean:
- x SE y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For the x-coordinates:
From x SE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
Combining these: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
Therefore: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

For the y-coordinates:
From x SE y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
From y SE z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
Since y is a region, we know infy(y) ≤ supy(y)
Combining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
Therefore: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Since we have both supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is NE of z

First, I'll analyze what these relations tell us:

From x SE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

East-West relationship between x and z:
Combining supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), by transitivity:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
This means x must be to the east of z.

North-South relationship between x and z:
From the given constraints, we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These don't establish a direct north-south relationship between x and z, meaning x could be:
- To the south of z (making x SE of z)
- Vertically aligned with z (making x E of z)
- To the north of z (making x NE of z)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
SE, E, NE
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: The question asks for possible relations between region x and region z, given:
1. Region x is SE of region y
2. Region y is B of region z

To determine this, I need to analyze what these relations mean in terms of the spatial constraints:

For x SE of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east/right of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south/below y)

For y B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's bounding box extends at least as far west as y's)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z's bounding box extends at least as far east as y's)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bounding box extends at least as far south as y's)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's bounding box extends at least as far north as y's)

Given these constraints, the possible relations are:

SE, S, E, B
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z given that x is NE of y and y is N of z.

First, let me analyze what these relations tell us:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is entirely to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is definitely to the north of z
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means the westernmost point of x is to the east of the westernmost point of z

The possible relations between x and z are:

1. N - If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), meaning x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection.

2. NE - If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning x is entirely to the east of z.

No other cardinal direction relations are possible because x must be to the north of z, and the constraints on the x-coordinates rule out NW, W, SW relations.

The answer is: N, NE
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: 
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: To solve this cardinal direction problem, I need to trace the relationships step by step.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is E of region z

From the definitions:
- x NE y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y E z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For the east-west relationship:
- From y E z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- From x NE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- By transitivity: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

This means x must be to the east of z, ruling out B, S, SW, W, NW, and N.

For the north-south relationship:
- We know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)
- We know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is vertically contained within z)
- But we cannot definitively determine the vertical relationship between x and z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
NE, E, SE
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I need to analyze the possible relations between x and z when x is NE of y and y is S of z.

Let me reason through this step by step:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally within z's bounds)

Combining these constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)

The possible relations between x and z are:

1. NE: x can be northeast of z
2. E: x can be east of z
3. SE: x can be southeast of z
4. N: x can be north of z
5. S: x can be south of z
6. B: x can be inside z's bounding box

The relations NW, W, and SW are impossible because the constraints guarantee that x must be at least partially to the east of z.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

N, NE, NW

I determined this by analyzing the given cardinal direction relationships:
- x is NE of y means x is to the east and north of y
- y is NW of z means y is to the west and north of z

From these constraints:
1. Since y is north of z and x is north of y, we can determine that x must be north of z
2. However, the east-west relationship between x and z is not fully constrained

Therefore, x can be directly north of z (N), northeast of z (NE), or northwest of z (NW).
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the first relation:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From the second relation:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Looking at these constraints, both x and z are positioned northeast of y, but their positions relative to each other are not directly constrained. I can verify all possible relations by constructing examples:

1. N: y at (0,0), z at (1,1) with width 2, x at (1,3)
2. NE: y at (0,0), z at (1,1), x at (3,3)
3. E: y at (0,0), z at (1,2), x at (3,1)
4. SE: y at (0,0), z at (1,3), x at (3,1)
5. S: y at (0,0), z at (1,3), x at (1,1)
6. SW: y at (0,0), z at (3,3), x at (1,1)
7. W: y at (0,0), z at (3,1), x at (1,1)
8. NW: y at (0,0), z at (3,1), x at (1,3)
9. B: y at (0,0), z at (1,1) with size 3×3, x at (2,2) with size 1×1

Therefore, all possible relations are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

NE, E, SE

To determine this, I analyzed what we know:
- x is NE of y, so: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SE of z, so: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For the x-coordinates:
From these constraints, we get: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
Therefore: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
This means x is definitely east of z.

For the y-coordinates:
We know: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
From these, we cannot directly determine whether x is north of, south of, or at the same latitude as z.

Since x is definitely east of z, but can have varying north-south relationships with z, the possible cardinal direction relations are NE, E, and SE.
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given constraints:
- x NE y (meaning supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- y NE z (meaning supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y))

I can derive:
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Therefore:
supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

This precisely matches the definition of the NE relation. When checking all other possible cardinal directions (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B), they each violate at least one of our derived constraints.

NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: Based on the given information, I need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is NE of y
- y is B of z

I'll analyze what these conditions tell us:

For x NE of y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

For y B of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Examining each possible relation between x and z:

- B: Possible if z extends far enough to contain x
- N: Possible if z extends east past x but not north past x
- NE: Possible if z doesn't extend beyond y in the northeast direction
- E: Possible if z extends north past x but not east past x

The relations S, SW, W, NW, and SE are impossible due to the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: B, N, NE, E
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z, given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is N of region z

I'll analyze the constraints step by step:

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [western boundary of x is east of or at western boundary of y]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) [eastern boundary of x is west of or at eastern boundary of y]
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) [southern boundary of x is north of or at southern boundary of y]
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) [northern boundary of x is south of or at northern boundary of y]

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) [northern boundary of z is south of or at southern boundary of y]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) [western boundary of z is west of or at western boundary of y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [eastern boundary of y is west of or at eastern boundary of z]

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) [x must be completely north of z]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) [western boundary relationships]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [eastern boundary relationships]

These constraints exactly match the definition of the N relation:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✓

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: Based on the given constraints, let me determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x B y (x is in the bounding box of y)
- y W z (y is west of z)

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) 
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), therefore supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), therefore infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), therefore supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

These three derived constraints exactly match the definition of the W relation:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is strictly to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's bottom boundary is at or below x's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is at or below z's top boundary)

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is W.
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Given the constraints:
- Region x is B of region y: This means x is inside the bounding box of y.
- Region y is E of region z: This means y is strictly to the east of z.

Let me analyze the possible relations between x and z by examining the constraints:

For x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For y E z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x): This means x is strictly to the east of z
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x): The bottom edge of x is above or at the same level as the bottom edge of z
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z): The top edge of x is below or at the same level as the top edge of z

This configuration satisfies exactly the definition of the E relation: x is strictly to the east of z, and the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z.

Therefore, E is the only possible relation between region x and region z.
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I'll analyze the constraints from the given information.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is S of region z

Step 1: Understand the constraints from x B y.
When x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge isn't to the left of y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge isn't to the right of y's right edge)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom edge isn't below y's bottom edge)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top edge isn't above y's top edge)

Step 2: Understand the constraints from y S z.
When y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y's top edge is at or below z's bottom edge)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge)

Step 3: Derive constraints between x and z through transitivity.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge isn't to the left of z's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right edge isn't to the right of z's right edge)

These constraints exactly match the definition of the S relation:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is S (South).
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

From "x is B of y," we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From "y is NW of z," we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These derived constraints (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) are exactly the definition of the NW relation.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This gives us:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These constraints exactly match the definition of SW relation. Any region x that satisfies the original constraints will always be southwest of region z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is:

SW
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

First, let me analyze what we know:
- Region x is B of region y: This means x is inside the bounding box of y
- Region y is SE of region z: This means y is in the southeast direction from z

From the definition of SE:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is strictly to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is strictly below z)

From the definition of B:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge is at or to the right of y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge is at or to the left of y's right edge)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom edge is at or above y's bottom edge)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top edge is at or below y's top edge)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is strictly to the right of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is strictly below z)

Being strictly to the right of z and strictly below z means x can only be in the SE direction from z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given information, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These derived constraints tell us that:
1. The rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x
2. The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x

According to the definitions, these constraints perfectly match the NE relation.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: Based on the problem statement, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z.

Let me work through this step by step:

For "x B y", we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For "y B z", we have:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

By transitivity, we can derive:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

These inequalities exactly match the definition of the B relation. Therefore, if region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

B
