{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The relation between x and z must place x completely north of z, while their horizontal order is not fixed. Hence x can be:\n\nN of z (directly north),\nNE of z (north-east), or\nNW of z (north-west).", "elapsed-time": 40.75352931022644, "reasoning-tokens": 2176, "completion-tokens": 2247}
