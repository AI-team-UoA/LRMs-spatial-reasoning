PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The relation between x and z must place x completely north of z, while their horizontal order is not fixed. Hence x can be:

N of z (directly north),
NE of z (north-east), or
NW of z (north-west).
