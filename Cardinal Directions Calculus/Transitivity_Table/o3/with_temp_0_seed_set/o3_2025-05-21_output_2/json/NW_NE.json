{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "From the given facts we always get  \n\u2022 supy(z) \u2264 infy(x)\u2003(so x lies completely above z).\n\nHorizontally, however, nothing fixes the order of x and z\u2014x may be directly above z, or a little to its west, or a little to its east.  \nConsequently the only cardinal\u2010direction relations that can occur between x and z are\n\nN\u2003(if x is straight north of z)  \nNW\u2002(if x is north-west of z)  \nNE\u2002(if x is north-east of z)\n\nThus the possible relations are: N, NW, NE.", "elapsed-time": 62.89381718635559, "reasoning-tokens": 3904, "completion-tokens": 4051}
