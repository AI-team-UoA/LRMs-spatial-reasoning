{"prompt": "If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "From x N y we get supy(y) \u2264 infy(x) and supx(x) \u2264 supx(y).  \nFrom y SW z we get supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).\n\nCombining these gives supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z), i.e. x is completely to the west of z.  \nNothing fixes the vertical ordering between x and z:  \n\u2013 x\u2019s y-interval can lie wholly below that of z \u2192 x SW z.  \n\u2013 it can be wholly above that of z \u2192 x NW z.  \n\u2013 it can be inside that of z \u2192 x W z.\n\nHence the only possible cardinal-direction relations between x and z are\n\nW, SW, NW", "elapsed-time": 65.02333474159241, "reasoning-tokens": 2944, "completion-tokens": 3146}
