PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the given facts we always get  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (so x lies completely above z).

Horizontally, however, nothing fixes the order of x and z—x may be directly above z, or a little to its west, or a little to its east.  
Consequently the only cardinal‐direction relations that can occur between x and z are

N (if x is straight north of z)  
NW (if x is north-west of z)  
NE (if x is north-east of z)

Thus the possible relations are: N, NW, NE.
