PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Given the constraints, region x must lie horizontally inside the bounding box of region z, while its vertical position relative to z is unrestricted except that both of them are north of y.  

Hence x can be  

• completely north of z  → N  
• completely south of z → S  
• completely inside the bounding box of z → B  

No other single-tile relation is compatible with the horizontal-containment condition.  
Possible relations: N, S, B
