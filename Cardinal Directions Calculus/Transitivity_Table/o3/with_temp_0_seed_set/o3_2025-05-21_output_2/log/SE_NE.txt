PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From  
x SE y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  
y NE z  ⇒  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These give the chain  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
Hence x is definitely to the east of z (no x-overlap).

Nothing in the premises fixes the vertical ordering between x and z, so three cases are possible:  

1. Their y-intervals overlap → x E z  
2. x lies above z      → x NE z  
3. x lies below z      → x SE z

No other single-tile relation can satisfy the inequalities.  
Therefore the possible relations between x and z are

NE, E, SE.
