PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From x N y we get supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
From y SW z we get supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Combining these gives supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), i.e. x is completely to the west of z.  
Nothing fixes the vertical ordering between x and z:  
– x’s y-interval can lie wholly below that of z → x SW z.  
– it can be wholly above that of z → x NW z.  
– it can be inside that of z → x W z.

Hence the only possible cardinal-direction relations between x and z are

W, SW, NW
