For r1: N, r2: S, answer: Given the constraints, region x must lie horizontally inside the bounding box of region z, while its vertical position relative to z is unrestricted except that both of them are north of y.  

Hence x can be  

• completely north of z  → N  
• completely south of z → S  
• completely inside the bounding box of z → B  

No other single-tile relation is compatible with the horizontal-containment condition.  
Possible relations: N, S, B
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: From x N y we get supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
From y SW z we get supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Combining these gives supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), i.e. x is completely to the west of z.  
Nothing fixes the vertical ordering between x and z:  
– x’s y-interval can lie wholly below that of z → x SW z.  
– it can be wholly above that of z → x NW z.  
– it can be inside that of z → x W z.

Hence the only possible cardinal-direction relations between x and z are

W, SW, NW

For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: From the given facts we always get  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (so x lies completely above z).

Horizontally, however, nothing fixes the order of x and z—x may be directly above z, or a little to its west, or a little to its east.  
Consequently the only cardinal‐direction relations that can occur between x and z are

N (if x is straight north of z)  
NW (if x is north-west of z)  
NE (if x is north-east of z)

Thus the possible relations are: N, NW, NE.

For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: S, SE, SW
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: From  
x SE y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  
y NE z  ⇒  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These give the chain  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
Hence x is definitely to the east of z (no x-overlap).

Nothing in the premises fixes the vertical ordering between x and z, so three cases are possible:  

1. Their y-intervals overlap → x E z  
2. x lies above z      → x NE z  
3. x lies below z      → x SE z

No other single-tile relation can satisfy the inequalities.  
Therefore the possible relations between x and z are

NE, E, SE.
