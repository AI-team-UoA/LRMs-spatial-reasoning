PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Given  

x NW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  
y N  z ⇒ supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these we always get the vertical inequality  

supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  

so x is certainly north of z.  
Horizontally, however, two different situations can occur:

1. supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the west of z)  
   Together with the vertical inequality this gives x NW z.

2. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the two regions overlap horizontally)  
   Together with the vertical inequality this gives x N z.

No other single-tile cardinal relation can be satisfied.  
Hence the possible relations between x and z are

N, NW
