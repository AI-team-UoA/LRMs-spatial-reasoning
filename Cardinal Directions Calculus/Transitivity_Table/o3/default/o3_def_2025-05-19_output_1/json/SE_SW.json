{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The relation between x and z must place x somewhere strictly south of z, while the horizontal ordering is unconstrained (x may lie to the left of, under, or to the right of z). Hence the only possible single-tile cardinal relations are\n\nS, SE, SW", "elapsed-time": 57.03530764579773, "reasoning-tokens": 3584, "completion-tokens": 3658}
