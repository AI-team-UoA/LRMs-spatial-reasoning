For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: All nine single-tile cardinal relations are achievable:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: The only relations that can hold between x and z are: N, NE, or NW.
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: N, W, NW, B
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: N, NW, W, SW, S, B
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: W, SW
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: The available information rules out every relation in which x is north of z, but leaves all southern or overlapping cases feasible. The relations that can be satisfied simultaneously with  

•  x SW y and  
•  y E z  

are:  

B, S, SW, SE, W, E
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: S, SW
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: NW, W, SW
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: The only possible relations are  
SW, S, and SE.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Any of the nine basic cardinal-direction relations is attainable; depending on the exact sizes and positions of the two southwest-of-y regions, x can be  

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B  

with respect to z.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: SW, W, S, B
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: N, NE, E, SE, S, B
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: B, S, SW, SE, W, E
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: E, SE
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: S, SE
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: The relation between x and z must place x somewhere strictly south of z, while the horizontal ordering is unconstrained (x may lie to the left of, under, or to the right of z). Hence the only possible single-tile cardinal relations are

S, SE, SW
