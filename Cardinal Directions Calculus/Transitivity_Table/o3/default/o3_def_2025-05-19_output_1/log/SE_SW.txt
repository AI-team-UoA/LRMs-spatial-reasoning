PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The relation between x and z must place x somewhere strictly south of z, while the horizontal ordering is unconstrained (x may lie to the left of, under, or to the right of z). Hence the only possible single-tile cardinal relations are

S, SE, SW
