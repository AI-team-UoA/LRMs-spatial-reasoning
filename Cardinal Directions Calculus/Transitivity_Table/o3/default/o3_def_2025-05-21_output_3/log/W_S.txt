PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The information

x W y      supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

y S z      supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

implies

supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ⇒ supy(x) ≤ infy(z),

so x is completely south of z.

Horizontally we only know

supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Hence X’s right edge lies left of Y’s left edge, while Z’s left edge can be anywhere not right of Y’s. Two cases are possible:

1. supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  → x is west of z.  
   Together with the south condition this is the relation SW.

2. infx(z) < supx(x)  → x horizontally overlaps z.  
   Together with the south condition this is the relation S.

No arrangement can satisfy the east-of requirement for SE, and the other directions are excluded by the south positioning.

Therefore the only possible relations between x and z are

S or SW
