{"prompt": "Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "Depending on the horizontal placement of the two regions, the only cardinal-direction relations that can satisfy all the given constraints are  \n\nB  (x is inside the bounding box of z),  \nW  (x is West of z), or  \nE  (x is East of z).", "elapsed-time": 44.98449110984802, "reasoning-tokens": 3136, "completion-tokens": 3215}
