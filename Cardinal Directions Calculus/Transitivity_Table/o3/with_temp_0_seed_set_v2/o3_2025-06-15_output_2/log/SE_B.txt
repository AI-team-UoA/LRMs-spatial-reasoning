PROMPT: Let SE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The constraints

1. x SE y ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
2. y B z ⇒ infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

imply

• infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  → infx(z) ≤ infx(x)  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these inequalities we can realise the following relations between x and z by choosing suitable bounding boxes for z:

B (x is inside the bounding box of z)  
S (x is South of z)  
E (x is East of z)  
SE (x is South-East of z)

For the other five relations at least one defining inequality contradicts the chain deduced above, so they cannot occur.

Therefore the possible relations between x and z are:

B, S, E, SE
