PROMPT: Let E and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From  

x E y ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)  
y NE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y), supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Chain the inequalities:

supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)       ⇒ supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Thus both  
supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)  
hold.  

These are exactly the two conditions for x NE z.

No other cardinal-direction definition can be satisfied simultaneously with these two strict constraints (the additional requirements for N, E, B, etc. all fail). Therefore the only possible relation between x and z is

NE
