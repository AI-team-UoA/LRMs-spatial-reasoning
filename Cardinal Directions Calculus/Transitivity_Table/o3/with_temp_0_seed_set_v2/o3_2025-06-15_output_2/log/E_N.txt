PROMPT: Let E and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given 
• x E y → supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)  
• y N z → supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these inequalities we obtain  
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ⇒ supy(z) ≤ infy(x)  (so z lies completely south of x)

Hence x is north of z in the vertical sense.  
Horizontally we only know  
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  

The right bound of z, supx(z), can be either  
• ≤ infx(x) (in which case z is entirely west of x), or  
• ≥ supx(x) (in which case x is contained in the horizontal extent of z).

Therefore two different cardinal relations between x and z are possible:

1. NE (North-East) if supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  
2. N  (North)    if supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

No other cardinal relation can satisfy all the inequalities simultaneously.

Possible relations between region x and region z:  N, NE
