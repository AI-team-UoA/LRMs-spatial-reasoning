PROMPT: Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Depending on the horizontal placement of the two regions, the only cardinal-direction relations that can satisfy all the given constraints are  

B  (x is inside the bounding box of z),  
W  (x is West of z), or  
E  (x is East of z).
