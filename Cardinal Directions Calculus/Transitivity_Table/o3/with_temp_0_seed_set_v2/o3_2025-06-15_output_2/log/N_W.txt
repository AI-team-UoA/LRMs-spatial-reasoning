PROMPT: Let N and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From  
x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Hence  
supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  (x is to the west of z).

The vertical order is not fixed:  
• If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) then z lies wholly below x, giving x NW z.  
• If supy(z) > infy(x) (and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can be arranged) then the two boxes overlap vertically, giving x W z.

No other cardinal relation can satisfy all the required inequalities.  

Possible relations between x and z: W or NW.
