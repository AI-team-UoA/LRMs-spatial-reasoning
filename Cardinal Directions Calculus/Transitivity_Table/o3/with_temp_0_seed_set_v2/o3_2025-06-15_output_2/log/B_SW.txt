PROMPT: Let B and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given    
x B y ⇒ Lʏ ≤ Lₓ , Rₓ ≤ Rʏ , Bʏ ≤ Bₓ , Tₓ ≤ Tʏ  
y SW z ⇒ Rʏ ≤ L𝓏 , Tʏ ≤ B𝓏  

From these we get  
Rₓ ≤ Rʏ ≤ L𝓏 ⇒ Rₓ ≤ L𝓏  
Tₓ ≤ Tʏ ≤ B𝓏 ⇒ Tₓ ≤ B𝓏  

Hence  
supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z),

which is exactly the definition of x SW z.  
No other cardinal-direction definition is satisfied, so

Possible relation(s) between x and z: SW
