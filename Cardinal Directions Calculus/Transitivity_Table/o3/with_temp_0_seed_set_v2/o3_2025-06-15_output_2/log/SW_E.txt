PROMPT: Let SW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The composition
  x SW y  and  y E z
can be realised with x and z in several different relative positions.  
The relations that can occur between x and z are

SW , W , S , SE , E , B
