PROMPT: Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The information we have is

1. x N y ⇒ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
2. y B z ⇒ infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From these inequalities we get

infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),

so the x–extent of x is contained in that of z.  
For the y–extent we have

infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Hence infy(z) ≤ infy(x).  What we do not know is the relation between supy(x) and supy(z):

• If supy(x) ≤ supy(z) then the y–interval of x is also contained in that of z, and all four bounding-box inequalities for x B z are satisfied.  
• If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) then z lies completely below x, giving x N z.

No other basic relation can hold, because horizontally x is already completely inside z (so E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW are impossible) and vertically we cannot have x below z (so S is impossible).

Therefore the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are

B  (x is inside the bounding box of z)  
N  (x is north of z).

So the answer is: N or B.
