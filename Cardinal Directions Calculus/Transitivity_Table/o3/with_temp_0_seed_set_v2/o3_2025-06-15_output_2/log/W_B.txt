PROMPT: Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The only relations that can be satisfied are

B  (x is inside the bounding box of z)   
W  (x is to the West of z)

So x is either B of z or W of z.
