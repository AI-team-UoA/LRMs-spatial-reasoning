PROMPT: Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The constraints

x NE y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  
y B z    ⇒  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  
       and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

imply

infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  (1)  
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (2)

From (1) and (2) we can still freely choose the other ends of the bounding boxes
(supx(x), supy(x), supx(z), supy(z)), so four different relative positions of x and z
can be realised:

1.  B  (x is inside z):  
    choose supx(x) and supy(x) small enough and pick z large enough.

2.  N  (x north of z):  
    make supy(z) lower than infy(x) while letting z’s x–interval cover that of x.

3.  E  (x east of z):  
    make supx(z) lower than infx(x) while letting z’s y–interval cover that of x.

4.  NE (x north-east of z):  
    make both supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Trying to satisfy the defining inequalities for S, SE, SW, W or NW together with
(1)–(2) leads to contradictions (they would force, e.g., infy(x)=supy(x) or
infx(x)=supx(x), which is impossible for a 2-dimensional region).

Hence the possible cardinal-direction relations between x and z are

B, N, NE, E.
