PROMPT: Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Between x and z the relation must still be in the same vertical column (x is horizontally inside z), so only the following two relations are compatible with  
x S y and y B z:

B  (x’s bounding box is inside z’s)  
S  (x is strictly to the South of z)

Hence the possible relations are: B, S.
