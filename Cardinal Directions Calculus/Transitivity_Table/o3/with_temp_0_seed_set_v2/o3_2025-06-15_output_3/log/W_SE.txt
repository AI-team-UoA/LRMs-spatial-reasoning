PROMPT: Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The relation between x and z must place x somewhere south of z.  
Depending on their relative positions in the x-direction, the following three relations are possible:

SW   – if x is completely west of z;  
S    – if x’s x-projection lies within that of z;  
SE   – if x is completely east of z.

No other cardinal direction satisfies all given constraints, so the possible relations are:

SW, S, SE
