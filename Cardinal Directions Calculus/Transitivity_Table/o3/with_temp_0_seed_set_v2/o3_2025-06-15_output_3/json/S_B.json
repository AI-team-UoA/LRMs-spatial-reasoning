{"prompt": "Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "Between x and z the relation must still be in the same vertical column (x is horizontally inside z), so only the following two relations are compatible with  \nx S y and y B z:\n\nB  (x\u2019s bounding box is inside z\u2019s)  \nS  (x is strictly to the South of z)\n\nHence the possible relations are: B, S.", "elapsed-time": 62.361173152923584, "reasoning-tokens": 5056, "completion-tokens": 5153}
