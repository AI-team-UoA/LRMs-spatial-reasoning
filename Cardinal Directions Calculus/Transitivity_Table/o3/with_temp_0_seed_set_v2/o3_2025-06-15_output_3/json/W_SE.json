{"prompt": "Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "The relation between x and z must place x somewhere south of z.  \nDepending on their relative positions in the x-direction, the following three relations are possible:\n\nSW   \u2013 if x is completely west of z;  \nS    \u2013 if x\u2019s x-projection lies within that of z;  \nSE   \u2013 if x is completely east of z.\n\nNo other cardinal direction satisfies all given constraints, so the possible relations are:\n\nSW, S, SE", "elapsed-time": 36.0206732749939, "reasoning-tokens": 2816, "completion-tokens": 2928}
