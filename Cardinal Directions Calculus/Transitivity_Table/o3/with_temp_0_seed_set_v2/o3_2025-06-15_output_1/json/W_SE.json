{"prompt": "Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From x W y we know x lies completely to the west of y and overlaps y vertically.  \nFrom y SE z we know y is south-east of z, i.e. y lies completely to the south of z and to the east of z.\n\nPutting the two facts together gives  \nsupy(x) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z),  \nso x is totally south of z.\n\nHorizontally we only know that both x and z are to the west of y, but nothing fixes their mutual order; x can be left of z, right of z, or horizontally contained in z.\n\nTherefore the only cardinal directions compatible with \u201cx is south of z\u201d are\n\nSW\u2003(if x is also west of z),  \nS\u2003 (if x\u2019s x-extent is contained in z\u2019s),  \nSE\u2003(if x is east of z).\n\nAll three configurations can occur, so the possible relations between x and z are:\n\nSW, S, SE.", "elapsed-time": 30.000871658325195, "reasoning-tokens": 2112, "completion-tokens": 2338}
