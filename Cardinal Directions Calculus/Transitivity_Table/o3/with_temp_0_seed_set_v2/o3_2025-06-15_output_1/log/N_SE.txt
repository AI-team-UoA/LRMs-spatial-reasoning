PROMPT: Let N and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The relation that is forced by the given information is that x lies to the east of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  
Nothing in the premises fixes their relative north/south ordering, nor does it force x’s vertical span to lie inside, outside, or overlap that of z. Hence three different situations are compatible with the constraints:

1. z lies completely south of x  → x NE z  
   (supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

2. x’s and z’s vertical projections overlap, with x’s in-between z’s  → x E z  
   (supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can all be satisfied)

3. x lies completely south of z  → x SE z  
   (supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z))

Therefore the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

NE, E, SE
