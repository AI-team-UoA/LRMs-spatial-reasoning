PROMPT: Let N and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From  
x N y → supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
y E z → supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

we get  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ,  
so x is to the east of z.  
Concerning the y–coordinates we only know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z); hence

• It can be that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
 Then z is also south of x and the relation is x NE z.

• It can be that infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
 Then the y–interval of x is contained in that of z and the relation is x E z.

No other cardinal–direction definition can be satisfied.  
Therefore the only possible relations between x and z are

NE or E
