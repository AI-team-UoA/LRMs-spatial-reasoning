PROMPT: Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From x W y we know x lies completely to the west of y and overlaps y vertically.  
From y SE z we know y is south-east of z, i.e. y lies completely to the south of z and to the east of z.

Putting the two facts together gives  
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
so x is totally south of z.

Horizontally we only know that both x and z are to the west of y, but nothing fixes their mutual order; x can be left of z, right of z, or horizontally contained in z.

Therefore the only cardinal directions compatible with “x is south of z” are

SW (if x is also west of z),  
S  (if x’s x-extent is contained in z’s),  
SE (if x is east of z).

All three configurations can occur, so the possible relations between x and z are:

SW, S, SE.
