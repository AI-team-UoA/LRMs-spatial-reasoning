PROMPT: Let S and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the constraints

x S y ⇒ supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

y NW z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

we obtain

supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

Hence x’s bounding box lies entirely to the left of z’s bounding box.  
No restriction is imposed on their vertical ordering; x may be above, overlapping in y-range, or below z.

Therefore the only feasible cardinal direction relations from x to z are the three “western” ones:

NW, W, SW
