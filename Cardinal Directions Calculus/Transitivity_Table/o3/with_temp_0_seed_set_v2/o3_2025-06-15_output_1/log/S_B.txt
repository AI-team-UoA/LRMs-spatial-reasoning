PROMPT: Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given  
x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
y B z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these we obtain  
infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z);  
so x’s x-extent lies inside z’s x-extent.

Thus x cannot be E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW of z (all of them need the opposite horizontal inequalities).

Two possibilities remain:

1. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is completely below z → x S z.
2. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) already holds), then x’s box is inside z’s box → x B z.

Either of these vertical situations can occur while keeping x S y and y B z true, so both are feasible.

Therefore the possible relations between x and z are:
S or B.
