PROMPT: Let SW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given  
x SW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  
y S z  ⇒ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these we always have  
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z),  so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Horizontally we only know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y);  
supx(x) can be either ≤ or > infx(z) depending on the particular regions.

• If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) we obtain both  
supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(z) → x SW z.

• If infx(z) ≤ supx(x) we have  
supy(x) ≤ infy(z) together with  
infx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the latter two can always be satisfied by choosing a sufficiently wide z).  
This gives x S z.

All other nine cardinal-direction conditions require inequalities that contradict the fixed constraints above. Therefore the only relations that can hold between x and z are

S or SW.
