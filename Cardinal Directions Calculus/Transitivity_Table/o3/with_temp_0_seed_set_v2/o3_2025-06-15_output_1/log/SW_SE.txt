PROMPT: Let SW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From  
x SW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)          (x is west and south of y)  
y SE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)          (y is east and south of z)

Combining the two y–coordinates:  
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ⇒ supy(x) ≤ infy(z),

so x is definitely south of z.

Nothing is fixed in the x-direction between x and z; x can lie wholly to the west of z, overlap its x-projection, or lie wholly to the east of it. Hence the three possibilities are

SW : supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  
S  : infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  
SE : supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Therefore the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are

S, SW, SE
