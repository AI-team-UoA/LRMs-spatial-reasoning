PROMPT: Let SE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The situation

x SE y   and  y N z  

gives the following constraints on the bounding-box coordinates:

1. supx(y) ≤ infx(x)     ( x is to the right of y )
2. supy(x) ≤ infy(y)     ( x is below y )
3. supy(z) ≤ infy(y)     ( z is below y )
4. infx(z) ≤ infx(y)     ( y is inside z horizontally )
5. supx(y) ≤ supx(z)     ( ” )

Nothing fixes the position of z with respect to x beyond these
inequalities, so two main horizontal situations are possible:

A.  supx(z) ≤ infx(x)   (z lies completely to the left of x)  
B.  infx(z) ≤ infx(x) < supx(x) ≤ supx(z)  (x is horizontally inside z)

For each of them we can choose vertical coordinates that make any of the
following relations between x and z true:

•  Case A (z left of x):  
   – NE ( z below x )  
   – E  ( x vertically inside z )  
   – SE ( x below z )

•  Case B (x inside z horizontally):  
   – N ( z below x )  
   – B ( x inside z vertically as well )  
   – S ( x below z )

Hence the possible cardinal-direction relations that can hold between
x and z are

B, N, NE, E, SE, S.
