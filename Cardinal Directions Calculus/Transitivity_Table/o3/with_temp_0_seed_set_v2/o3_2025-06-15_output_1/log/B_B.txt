PROMPT: Let B and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Because  

x B y  ⇒ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)  
y B z  ⇒ infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining the inequalities gives  

infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z),

which is exactly the definition of x B z.  
None of the strict inequalities required by the other eight relations can be satisfied simultaneously with these four, so the only possible relation between x and z is

B
