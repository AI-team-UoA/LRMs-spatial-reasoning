PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only relations you cannot get are DC or EC (because x and z must share the interior part y).  In fact one finds

– x and z may properly overlap: PO(x,z)  
– x may be a proper part of z (either touching or not): TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)  
– z may be a proper part of x (either touching or not): TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)  
– or x and z may coincide: EQ(x,z)

### Answer:
{ PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z) }
