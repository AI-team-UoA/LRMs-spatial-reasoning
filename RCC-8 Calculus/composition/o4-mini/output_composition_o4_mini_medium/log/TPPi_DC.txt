PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given  
  1. TPPi(x,y), i.e. TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper‐part of x  
  2. DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected  

we know y⊂x and y∩z=∅.  Two cases arise for x and z: either z∩x=∅ or z∩x≠∅ but still z∩y=∅.  Hence the only RCC–8 relations possible between x and z are

  • DC(x,z)       (z is wholly outside x)  
  • EC(x,z)       (z just touches the boundary of x, but does not enter its interior)  
  • PO(x,z)       (z overlaps x in x∖y but neither is part of the other)  
  • TPP(z,x)      (z⊂x and z’s boundary meets x’s boundary; in the given notation TPP(z,x)=TPPi(x,z))  
  • NTPP(z,x)     (z⊂x and z’s interior does not meet x’s boundary; i.e. NTPPi(x,z))  

All other RCC–8 relations (TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), EQ(x,z)) are ruled out because y⊂x and y∩z=∅.  

### Answer:  
The possible relations are  
  DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).
