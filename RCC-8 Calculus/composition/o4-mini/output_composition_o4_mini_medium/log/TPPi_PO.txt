PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) (i.e. TPP(y,x)) and PO(y,z), x and z must have overlapping interiors (so neither DC nor EC) but x cannot be a part of z (else y⊂x⊂z would forbid PO(y,z)), nor can they be equal.  The only remaining RCC‐8 possibilities are  
  • z is a proper part of x without touching its boundary (NTPP(z,x) ≡ NTPPi(x,z))  
  • z is a proper part of x touching its boundary (TPP(z,x) ≡ TPPi(x,z))  
  • x and z partially overlap (PO(x,z))  

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z)
