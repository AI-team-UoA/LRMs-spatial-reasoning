PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only relations that cannot occur are the non‐tangential ones (NTPP or NTPPi).  In all other RCC‐8 cases two tangential proper‐parts of y may be disconnected, externally connected, partially overlap, one may be a tangential proper‐part of the other, or they may even coincide.  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z) or EQ(x,z)
