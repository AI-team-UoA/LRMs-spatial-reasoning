PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From EC(x,y) together with DC(y,z), z cannot reach the point where x abuts y.  Hence z cannot contain x (or be equal to x).  But z may lie entirely outside x, just touch it, overlap it, or sit inside x (in a part of x disjoint from y).  The only RCC‐8 relations remaining between x and z are

  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(z,x)  
  • NTPP(z,x)  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x)
