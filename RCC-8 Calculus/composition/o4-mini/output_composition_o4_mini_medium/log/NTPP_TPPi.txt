PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only constraints are that both x and z lie wholly inside y, but x never reaches y’s boundary and z does.  Within y they can therefore be

  • disconnected (DC)  
  • externally‐connected (EC)  
  • partially overlapping (PO)  
  • x a tangential proper part of z (TPP)  
  • x a non‐tangential proper part of z (NTPP)  

No other RCC–8 relation is possible.  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
