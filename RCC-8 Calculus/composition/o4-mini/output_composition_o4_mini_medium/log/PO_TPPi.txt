PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given  
 1. PO(x,y): x and y overlap (share some interior but neither contains the other)  
 2. TPPi(y,z): ≡ TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper‐part of y (z⊂y, touching y’s boundary)  

Since z is inside y and x overlaps only part of y, x and z may

• Be disjoint (DC)  
• Just touch at a boundary (EC)  
• Overlap (PO)  
• Have z as a tangential proper‐part of x (TPPi)  
• Have z as a non‐tangential proper‐part of x (NTPPi)  

### Answer:  
The possible relations between x and z are  
  DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).
