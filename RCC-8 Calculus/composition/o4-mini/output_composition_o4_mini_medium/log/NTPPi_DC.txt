PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The fact that NTPPi(x,y) (i.e. y ⊂ int x) and DC(y,z) (y and z disjoint) forces z to avoid the interior‐region of x that contains y, but it can still relate to x in any way that doesn’t imply y∩z≠∅.  Checking all RCC–8 patterns one finds that the only impossible relations are those in which x would be part of z (since then z would necessarily meet y) or x=z.  Hence the only possible relations between x and z are:

  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPPi(x,z)  
  • NTPPi(x,z)

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
