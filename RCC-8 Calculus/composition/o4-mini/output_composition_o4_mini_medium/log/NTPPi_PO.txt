PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) (i.e. y NTPP−−→ x, so y is a non‐tangential proper part of x) and PO(y,z) (y overlaps z), z must penetrate the interior of x but need not fill it, nor stay wholly outside.  Hence x and z cannot be DC, EC or EQ, but can stand in any of the other five RCC‑8 relations:

  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • NTPP(x,z)  
  • TPPi(x,z)  (≡ TPP(z,x))  
  • NTPPi(x,z) (≡ NTPP(z,x))  

### Answer:  
Possible relations between x and z are  
{ PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) }.
