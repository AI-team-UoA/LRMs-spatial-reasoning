PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given only that x and y are disconnected and y and z are externally‐connected, one can show by drawing counter‐examples that x and z could be in any of these five RCC‑8 relations:  
  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • NTPP(x,z)  

### Answer:  
{ DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z) }
