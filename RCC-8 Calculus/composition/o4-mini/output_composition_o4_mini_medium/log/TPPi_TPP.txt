PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) (i.e. TPP(y,x)) and TPP(y,z), x and z must both strictly contain y, so x and z overlap in an “interior” way.  One easily checks that they cannot be disconnected (DC) or just externally‐connected (EC), nor can one be a (proper) part of the other unless they are in fact identical.  Hence the only possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are

  • EQ(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)

### Answer:
EQ(x,z) or PO(x,z)
