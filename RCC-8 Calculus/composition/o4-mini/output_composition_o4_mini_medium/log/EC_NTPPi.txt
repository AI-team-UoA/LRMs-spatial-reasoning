PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (i.e. y ⊂ int(z)), x must penetrate z’s interior in order to touch y.  Hence x cannot be DC or EC to z, nor equal z nor contain z.  The only possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are

  • NTPP(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)

### Answer:
The possible relations are NTPP(x,z), TPP(x,z) or PO(x,z).
