PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The fact that  
 1. TPP(x,y) ⇒ x ⊂ y and x’s boundary meets y’s boundary, and  
 2. NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y) ⇒ z ⊂ y and z’s boundary does *not* meet y’s boundary  
means both x and z lie inside y, but x “reaches out” to y’s boundary while z sits strictly in y’s interior.  One can check that this rules out x=z or x⊂z (since x touches y’s boundary, z cannot contain it) and also rules out z⊂y⊂x, etc.  The only RCC‐8 relations consistent between x and z are those where  

 • x and z are disjoint (DC),  
 • x and z touch but do not overlap (EC),  
 • x and z partially overlap but neither contains the other (PO),  
 • z is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)),  
 • z is a non‑tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)).  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x)
