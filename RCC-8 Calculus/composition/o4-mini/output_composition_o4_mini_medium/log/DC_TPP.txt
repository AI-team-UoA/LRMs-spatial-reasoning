PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) (so y⊂z touching z’s boundary), x must avoid y but may lie wholly outside z, touch z, overlap z only on the part outside y, or lie inside z off y’s region.  Hence the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

### Answer: {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP}
