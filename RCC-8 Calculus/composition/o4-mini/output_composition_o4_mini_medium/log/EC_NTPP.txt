PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), x can only  
– touch z on x’s boundary (but not share interior)  
– overlap z (share some interior, but not be a subset)  
– be a tangential proper‐part of z  
– be a non‑tangential proper‑part of z  

In RCC‑8 terms the only possible x–z relations are

  EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
