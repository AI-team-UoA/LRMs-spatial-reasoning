PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) (i.e. y TPP x) and EC(y,z), y touches z on y’s boundary.  Since y is a proper part of x touching x’s boundary, that contact‐point can lie (a) on x’s boundary or (b) in x’s interior.  From that one shows that z may either  
 1. touch x (EC(x,z)),  
 2. overlap x without containment (PO(x,z)),  
 3. lie entirely inside x touching its boundary (TPPi(x,z)), or  
 4. lie entirely inside x away from x’s boundary (NTPPi(x,z)).  

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
