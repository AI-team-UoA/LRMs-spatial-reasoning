PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only RCC‐8 relations between x and z that are consistent with  
  (i)  NTPPi(x,y)  (≡ NTPP(y,x))  and  
  (ii) TPP(y,z)  
are those in which x and z share interior‐parts (since y lies in both) but neither DC nor EC nor EQ nor NTPP(x,z) can hold.  One finds exactly four possibilities:  
  •  TPP(x,z)  
  •  PO  (x,z)  
  •  TPPi(x,z)  (≡ TPP(z,x))  
  •  NTPPi(x,z)  (≡ NTPP(z,x))  

### Answer:  
TPP(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
