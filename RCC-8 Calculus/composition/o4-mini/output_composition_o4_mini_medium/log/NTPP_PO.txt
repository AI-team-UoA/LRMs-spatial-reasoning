PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), x lies wholly inside y, while y both overlaps and is distinct from z.  Depending on where x sits relative to z’s region, the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are

  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • NTPP(x,z)

### Answer: {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP}
