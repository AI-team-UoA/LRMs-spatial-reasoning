PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The RCC‑8 composition DC ∘ PO yields exactly five possible base‐relations.  In other words, from

 DC(x,y)  and  PO(y,z)

we can only infer that x and z stand in one of

 DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
