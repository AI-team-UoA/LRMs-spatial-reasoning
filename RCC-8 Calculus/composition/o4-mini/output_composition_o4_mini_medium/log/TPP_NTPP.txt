PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) (x is a tangential proper part of y) and NTPP(y,z) (y is a non‐tangential proper part of z), we have

 closure(x) ⊆ closure(y) ⊂ interior(z)

so closure(x) ⊂ interior(z), which is exactly NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer:  
NTPP(x,z)
