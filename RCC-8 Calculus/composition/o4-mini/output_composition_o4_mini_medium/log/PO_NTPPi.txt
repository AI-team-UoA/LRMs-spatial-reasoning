PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given  
1. PO(x,y): x overlaps y (they share some interior, but neither contains the other),  
2. NTPPi(y,z) ≡ NTPP(z,y): z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (z⊂y, not touching y’s boundary),  

we ask: what can R(x,z) be?

– Since z⊂y and x overlaps y, z may lie entirely outside x (⇒ DC or EC),  
– it may partially overlap x (⇒ PO),  
– or it may lie wholly inside x (⇒ either tangential or non‐tangential proper part of x).

Thus the five possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are

  DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:  
{DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi} (as relations between x and z)
