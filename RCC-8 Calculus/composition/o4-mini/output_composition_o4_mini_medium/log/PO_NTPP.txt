PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then x’s interior meets z’s interior (via y) but x needn’t be wholly inside z.  The only RCC‑8 relations compatible with that are  
  • PO(x,z)   (x overlaps z but is neither contained in nor contains z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  (x is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary)  
  • NTPP(x,z) (x is a proper part of z and does not touch z’s boundary)  

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
