PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) (so x is entirely outside y) and NTPP(y,z) (so y is a proper interior part of z), x can lie anywhere relative to the remainder of z (i.e. z ∖ y), or entirely outside z.  The only RCC‐8 relations between x and z that remain consistent are:

  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • NTPP(x,z)

No other RCC‑8 relation (EQ, TPPi, NTPPi) is possible under DC(x,y) ∧ NTPP(y,z).  

### Answer:  
Possible relations between x and z are  
{ DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z) }
