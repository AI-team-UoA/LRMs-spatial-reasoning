PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since x and z are both (non‐tangential) proper parts of y, there is no further constraint on how x and z relate to one another.  They can stand in any of the eight RCC‑8 base relations.  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z)
