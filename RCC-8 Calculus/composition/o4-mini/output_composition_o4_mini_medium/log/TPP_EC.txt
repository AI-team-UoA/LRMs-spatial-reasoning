PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
Given TPP(x, y) and EC(y, z), x lies inside y (touching y’s boundary) and z lies outside y (touching y’s boundary).  Hence x and z cannot share interior parts, so they can only be either

• DC(x, z)  
• EC(x, z)
