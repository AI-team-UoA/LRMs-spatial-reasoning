{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "The fact that  \n 1. TPP(x,y) \u21d2 x \u2282 y and x\u2019s boundary meets y\u2019s boundary, and  \n 2. NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y) \u21d2 z \u2282 y and z\u2019s boundary does *not* meet y\u2019s boundary  \nmeans both x and z lie inside y, but x \u201creaches out\u201d to y\u2019s boundary while z sits strictly in y\u2019s interior.  One can check that this rules out x=z or x\u2282z (since x touches y\u2019s boundary, z cannot contain it) and also rules out z\u2282y\u2282x, etc.  The only RCC\u20108 relations consistent between x and z are those where  \n\n \u2022 x and z are disjoint (DC),  \n \u2022 x and z touch but do not overlap (EC),  \n \u2022 x and z partially overlap but neither contains the other (PO),  \n \u2022 z is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)),  \n \u2022 z is a non\u2011tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)).  \n\n### Answer:  \nDC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x)", "elapsed-time": 27.01022696495056, "reasoning-tokens": 1472, "completion-tokens": 1746}
