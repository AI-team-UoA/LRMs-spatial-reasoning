{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "From EC(x,y) together with DC(y,z), z cannot reach the point where x abuts y.  Hence z cannot contain x (or be equal to x).  But z may lie entirely outside x, just touch it, overlap it, or sit inside x (in a part of x disjoint from y).  The only RCC\u20108 relations remaining between x and z are\n\n  \u2022 DC(x,z)  \n  \u2022 EC(x,z)  \n  \u2022 PO(x,z)  \n  \u2022 TPP(z,x)  \n  \u2022 NTPP(z,x)  \n\n### Answer:  \nDC(x,z),\u00a0EC(x,z),\u00a0PO(x,z),\u00a0TPP(z,x),\u00a0NTPP(z,x)", "elapsed-time": 25.45575261116028, "reasoning-tokens": 2048, "completion-tokens": 2216}
