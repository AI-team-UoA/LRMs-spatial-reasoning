{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since x and z are both (non\u2010tangential) proper parts of y, there is no further constraint on how x and z relate to one another.  They can stand in any of the eight RCC\u20118 base relations.  \n\n### Answer:  \nDC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 16.495372533798218, "reasoning-tokens": 1664, "completion-tokens": 1776}
