{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "The only constraints are that both x and z lie wholly inside y, but x never reaches y\u2019s boundary and z does.  Within y they can therefore be\n\n  \u2022 disconnected (DC)  \n  \u2022 externally\u2010connected (EC)  \n  \u2022 partially overlapping (PO)  \n  \u2022 x a tangential proper part of z (TPP)  \n  \u2022 x a non\u2010tangential proper part of z (NTPP)  \n\nNo other RCC\u20138 relation is possible.  \n\n### Answer:  \nDC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 24.604110956192017, "reasoning-tokens": 2816, "completion-tokens": 2963}
