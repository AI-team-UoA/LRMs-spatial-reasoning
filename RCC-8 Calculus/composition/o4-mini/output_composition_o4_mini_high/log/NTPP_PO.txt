PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Below is an outline of the possible cases.  Since NTPP(x,y) says x lies strictly inside y, and PO(y,z) says y’s interior both overlaps and also fails to cover z, the region interior(y) splits into  
  – a part inside z,  
  – a part outside z,  
  – and z itself has a part outside y.  
Where x sits wholly in interior(y), it may end up  
  1. entirely outside z ⇒ DC(x,z)  
  2. touching z’s boundary without sharing interior ⇒ EC(x,z)  
  3. partly inside z and partly outside ⇒ PO(x,z)  
  4. entirely inside z but hitting z’s boundary ⇒ TPP(x,z)  
  5. entirely inside z’s interior ⇒ NTPP(x,z)  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
