PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) (i.e. y ⊂ x non‑tangentially) and TPP(y,z) (y ⊂ z tangentially) then x and z must share y in their interiors, so they cannot be DC or EC, and x cannot itself lie inside z.  The only remaining RCC‑8 links are that z may lie inside x (either touching its boundary or not) or that x and z partially overlap.  Hence the possible relations are

  • NTPPi(x,z)   (z ⊂ x non‑tangentially)  
  • TPPi(x,z)   (z ⊂ x tangentially)  
  • PO(x,z)     (x and z partially overlap)  

### Answer: {NTPPi(x,z), TPPi(x,z), PO(x,z)}
