PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPPi(x,y) says “y is a non‐tangential proper part of x” (so y lies entirely in the interior of x) and DC(y,z) says y and z are completely disconnected, z can lie

  1. entirely outside x (so DC(x,z)),  
  2. just touch x’s boundary (so EC(x,z)),  
  3. partially overlap x away from y (so PO(x,z)),  
  4. lie inside x but touching x’s boundary (so TPPi(x,z)), or  
  5. lie entirely inside x (away from both y and x’s boundary) (so NTPPi(x,z)).

No other RCC‑8 relation is consistent with y⊂int(x) and y⋂z=∅.

### Answer:
The possible relations between x and z are  
 DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
