PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only RCC‐8 relations R(x,z) compatible with  
  NTPPi(x,y)  (i.e. y is a non‑tangential proper part of x)  
and  
  EC(y,z)  
are

  EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:  
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)
