PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given  
  TPPi(x,y) ≡ TPP(y,x)  
  NTPPi(y,z) ≡ NTPP(z,y)  
we have y ⊂ₜ x (y tangentially inside x) and z ⊂ₙₜ y (z non‑tangentially inside y).  
Since z lies strictly in the interior of y and y lies within x, z also lies strictly in the interior of x.  
Hence the only possible RCC‑8 relation between x and z is  
  NTPPi(x,z)  
(i.e. NTPP(z,x)).  

### Answer:  
NTPPi(x,z)
