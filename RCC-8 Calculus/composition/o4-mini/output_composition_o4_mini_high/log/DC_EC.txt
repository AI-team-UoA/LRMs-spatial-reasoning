PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given only that DC(x,y) (x is completely disjoint from y) and EC(y,z) (y just touches z at the boundary), one can show by “building” examples that the only RCC‐8 links x–z which remain possible are

  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • NTPP(x,z)  

In particular x cannot coincide with z nor can it properly ⟲‐contain⟰ z (no TPPi/NTPPi) because if x contained z then it would also hit y at the point y touches z, contradicting DC(x,y).  

### Answer:  
The possible relations between x and z are exactly  
 DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).
