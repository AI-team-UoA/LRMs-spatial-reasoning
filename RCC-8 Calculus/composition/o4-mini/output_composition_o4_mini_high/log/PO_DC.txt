PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are

  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPPⱼ(x,z)  (i.e. TPP(z,x))  
  • NTPPⱼ(x,z) (i.e. NTPP(z,x))  

In other words, given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), x and z can be disconnected, externally‐connected, partially overlap, or z can be a proper (tangential or non‐tangential) part of x.
