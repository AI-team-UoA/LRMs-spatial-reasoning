PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only possible RCC‐8 links between x and z are these three:  
 1. x and z partially overlap (PO),  
 2. z is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)),  
 3. z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)).  

### Answer:  
Possible relations(x,z) ∈ { PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) }
