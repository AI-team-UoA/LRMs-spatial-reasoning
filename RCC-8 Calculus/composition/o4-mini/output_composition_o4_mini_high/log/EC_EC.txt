PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only relations that can arise in RCC‐8 from “EC ∘ EC” are

 DC(x,z)  
 EC(x,z)  
 PO(x,z)

So if EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then x and z can be disconnected, externally connected, or partly overlapping.  

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z) or PO(x,z)
