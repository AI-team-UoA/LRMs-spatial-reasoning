PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only relations that can arise are those in which 𝑥 is either disjoint from, merely touching, partially overlapping, or strictly “containing” 𝑧 – but never the other way around (i.e. 𝑥⊂𝑧), nor EQ.  In RCC‐8 notation one finds:

DC(x,z),  EC(x,z),  PO(x,z),  TPPi(x,z) (≡ TPP(z,x)),  NTPPi(x,z) (≡ NTPP(z,x))  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
