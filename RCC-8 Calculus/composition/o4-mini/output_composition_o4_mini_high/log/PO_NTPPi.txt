PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (i.e. z ⊂ y interiorly), then x may or may not hit z, and if it does hit it may overlap it or even contain it.  Checking all cases one finds exactly five RCC‑8 possibilities for (x,z):

  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPPi(x,z)  
  • NTPPi(x,z)  

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
