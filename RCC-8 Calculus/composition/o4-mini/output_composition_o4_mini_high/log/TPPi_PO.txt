PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only ways x and z can relate are that z is (possibly tangentially) a proper‐part of x or that x and z partially overlap.  In RCC–8 notation:

### Answer:
Possible relations between x and z are  
 PO(x,z),  
 TPPi(x,z),
