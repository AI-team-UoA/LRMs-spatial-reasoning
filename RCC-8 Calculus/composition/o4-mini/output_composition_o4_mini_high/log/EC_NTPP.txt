PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only possible RCC‐8 links between x and z are

  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • NTPP(x,z)

In other words, given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), x may partially overlap z, or be a (tangential) proper part of z, or be a non‐tangential proper part of z.
