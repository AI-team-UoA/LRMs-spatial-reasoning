PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only constraint is that both x and z lie entirely outside y, so x and z themselves can stand in any of the eight RCC‐8 relations.  In other words

DC∘DC = { DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPP⁻¹, NTPP⁻¹, EQ }.  

### Answer:  
Possible relations between x and z are  
 DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x), or EQ(x,z).
