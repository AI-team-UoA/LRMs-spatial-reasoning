PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
From the RCC‐8 composition table one finds  
 TPP ∘ TPP = { TPP, NTPP }.  
In other words, if TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then between x and z only  
 • TPP(x,z)  
or  
 • NTPP(x,z)  
can hold.
