PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (so y lies entirely in the interior of x) and PO(y,z) means y and z overlap without inclusion, any overlap between y and z occurs inside x.  Hence x and z must share interior, but neither can be disconnected or merely touch.  The only RCC‐8 relations compatible with an interior overlap are

  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPPi(x,z)  (x is a tangential proper part of z)  
  • NTPPi(x,z) (x is a non‐tangential proper part of z)

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z)
