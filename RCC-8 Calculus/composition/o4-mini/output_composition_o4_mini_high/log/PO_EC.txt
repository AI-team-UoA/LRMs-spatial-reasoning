PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then x may lie “away from” the y–z contact, it may just touch z, it may overlap z, or z may even lie (properly) inside x.  In RCC‐8 notation the only relations consistent with PO(x,y) ∧ EC(y,z) are

 DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z) (i.e. TPP(z,x)), and NTPPi(x,z) (i.e. NTPP(z,x)).  

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
