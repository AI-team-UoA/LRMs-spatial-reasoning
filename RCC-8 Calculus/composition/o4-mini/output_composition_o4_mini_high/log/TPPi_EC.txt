PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

You get four and only four possibilities.  Intuitively, depending on whether the y–z contact lies on x’s boundary or in x’s interior, z may lie outside x (EC), overlap x (PO), be a tangential part of x (TPPi), or a non‐tangential part of x (NTPPi).  

### Answer:  
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
