PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) (i.e. TPP(y,x)) and TPP(y,z), x and z must overlap (they both contain y) and each always touches the other’s boundary via y.  One can show that the only RCC‑8 relations that can arise between x and z are

  EQ(x,z)  
  TPP(x,z)  
  TPPi(x,z)  
  PO(x,z)

and no other of the eight RCC‑8 relations is possible.  

### Answer: EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), PO(x,z)
