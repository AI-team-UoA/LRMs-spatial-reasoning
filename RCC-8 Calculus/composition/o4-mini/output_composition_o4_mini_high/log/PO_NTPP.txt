PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), y lies strictly inside z and x overlaps y (hence x meets the interior of z).  Three and only three RCC‑8 relations can then hold between x and z:

  • x overlaps z (PO)  
  • x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP)  
  • x is a non‑tangential proper part of z (NTPP)

### Answer:  
Possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
