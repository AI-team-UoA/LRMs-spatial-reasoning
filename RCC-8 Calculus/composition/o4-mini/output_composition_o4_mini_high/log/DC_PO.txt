PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x lies entirely outside y while z has some part outside y.  Thus x may or may not meet that “outside‐y” part of z, and when it does it can overlap or lie inside it (with or without touching z’s boundary).  The only excluded RCC‑8 relations are those that would force x to meet y (namely EQ, TPPi, NTPPi) or make x contain z.  

### Answer:  
The possible relations between x and z are  
  DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
