PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given  
 1. NTPPi(x,y)  (i.e. y NTPP−1→ x, so y is a proper non‐tangential part of x),  
 2. NTPP(y,z)  (so y is a proper non‐tangential part of z),  

we know y lies strictly inside both x and z.  Hence x and z must share a non‐empty interior region (at least y), so they cannot be DC or EC; all the other RCC‐8 relations that involve interior‐sharing are in principle possible.  In particular the possible relations between x and z are

 PO(x,z),  
 TPP(x,z),  
 NTPP(x,z),  
 TPPi(x,z),  
 NTPPi(x,z),  
 EQ(x,z).  

### Answer: {PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}
