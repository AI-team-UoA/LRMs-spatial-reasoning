PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (i.e. z TPP y), x lies just outside y touching its boundary, while z lies just inside y touching that same boundary.  Hence x and z can only

  • be disconnected (DC), if they touch different parts of y’s boundary, or  
  • be externally connected (EC), if they touch the same boundary point(s).

No other RCC‑8 relation is possible.  

### Answer: {DC, EC}
