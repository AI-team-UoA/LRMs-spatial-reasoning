PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), x must be disjoint from y but y sits tangentially inside z.  Hence x cannot contain z or be equal to z (otherwise it would meet y), but x may lie wholly outside z, touch z’s boundary, overlap z, or lie inside z (either touching its boundary or not).  In RCC‑8 terms the only relations ruled out are TPPi, NTPPi and EQ.  The possible relations between x and z are therefore

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
