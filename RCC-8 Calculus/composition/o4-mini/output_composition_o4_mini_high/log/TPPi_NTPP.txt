PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) (i.e. TPP(y,x)) and NTPP(y,z), one can show that x and z must share the region y but neither can contain the other unless x⊂z.  Enumerating all geometrically consistent cases yields exactly three possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z:

  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • NTPP(x,z)

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
