PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then x must overlap z (since x has an interior in y and y⊂z), so the only RCC‐8 relations possible between x and z are

  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • NTPP(x,z)  

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
