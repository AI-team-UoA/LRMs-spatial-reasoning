PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
The possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are exactly

  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • NTPP(x,z)

No other RCC‐8 relation (EQ, TPPi or NTPPi) can occur.
