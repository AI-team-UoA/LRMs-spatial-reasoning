PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) (x is a non‐tangential proper part of y) and TPPi(y,z) (i.e. z is a tangential proper part of y), x and z both lie inside y but one touches y’s boundary and the other does not.  A little case‐analysis shows that no equality or sup‐part relation can hold, but the following five RCC–8 relations are all possible between x and z:

  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(x,z)  
  • NTPP(x,z)  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
