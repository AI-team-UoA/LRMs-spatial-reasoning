{"prompt": "If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), y lies strictly inside z and x overlaps y (hence x meets the interior of z).  Three and only three RCC\u20118 relations can then hold between x and z:\n\n  \u2022 x overlaps z (PO)  \n  \u2022 x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP)  \n  \u2022 x is a non\u2011tangential proper part of z (NTPP)\n\n### Answer:  \nPossible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 40.48395562171936, "reasoning-tokens": 3648, "completion-tokens": 3786}
