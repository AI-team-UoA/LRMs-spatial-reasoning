{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "You get four and only four possibilities.  Intuitively, depending on whether the y\u2013z contact lies on x\u2019s boundary or in x\u2019s interior, z may lie outside x (EC), overlap x (PO), be a tangential part of x (TPPi), or a non\u2010tangential part of x (NTPPi).  \n\n### Answer:  \nEC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 88.093918800354, "reasoning-tokens": 8064, "completion-tokens": 8179}
