{"prompt": "If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given  \n 1. NTPPi(x,y)  (i.e. y NTPP\u22121\u2192 x, so y is a proper non\u2010tangential part of x),  \n 2. NTPP(y,z)  (so y is a proper non\u2010tangential part of z),  \n\nwe know y lies strictly inside both x and z.  Hence x and z must share a non\u2010empty interior region (at least y), so they cannot be DC or EC; all the other RCC\u20108 relations that involve interior\u2010sharing are in principle possible.  In particular the possible relations between x and z are\n\n\u2003PO(x,z),  \n\u2003TPP(x,z),  \n\u2003NTPP(x,z),  \n\u2003TPPi(x,z),  \n\u2003NTPPi(x,z),  \n\u2003EQ(x,z).  \n\n### Answer: {PO,\u00a0TPP,\u00a0NTPP,\u00a0TPPi,\u00a0NTPPi,\u00a0EQ}", "elapsed-time": 58.1509165763855, "reasoning-tokens": 5504, "completion-tokens": 5724}
