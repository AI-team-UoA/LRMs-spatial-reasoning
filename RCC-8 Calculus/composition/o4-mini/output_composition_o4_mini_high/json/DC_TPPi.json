{"prompt": "If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given DC(x,y) (x and y share no points) and TPPi(y,z)=TPP(z,y) (z\u2282y), z lies entirely inside y.  Since x is disjoint from all of y, it must also be disjoint from z.  \n### Answer:  \nDC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 54.225653409957886, "reasoning-tokens": 7104, "completion-tokens": 7189}
