{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (i.e. z\u00a0TPP\u00a0y), x lies just outside y touching its boundary, while z lies just inside y touching that same boundary.  Hence x and z can only\n\n  \u2022 be disconnected (DC), if they touch different parts of y\u2019s boundary, or  \n  \u2022 be externally connected (EC), if they touch the same boundary point(s).\n\nNo other RCC\u20118 relation is possible.  \n\n### Answer: {DC, EC}", "elapsed-time": 34.03056597709656, "reasoning-tokens": 2560, "completion-tokens": 2684}
