{"prompt": "If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "The only constraints are that x must avoid y, but y sits inside z.  Hence x may lie entirely outside z (giving DC or EC) or it may overlap or lie within z\u2019s \u201cshell\u201d outside y (giving PO, TPP or NTPP).  EQ, TPPi or NTPPi are ruled out.  \n\n### Answer:  \nDC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 14.556305646896362, "reasoning-tokens": 1088, "completion-tokens": 1204}
