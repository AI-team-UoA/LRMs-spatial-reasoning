PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only relations ruling out are those that don’t allow x and z to share any interior (DC, EC) or force them to coincide (EQ).  From NTPPi(x,y) (i.e. y ⊂ x, not touching x’s boundary) and TPP(y,z) (y ⊂ z, touching z’s boundary) one can show that x and z must share an interior part but neither can be forced into a strict containment without boundary‐touching, nor into disjointness or equality.  Hence the possible RCC‑8 relations between x and z are:

• PO(x,z)  
• TPP(x,z)  
• NTPP(x,z)  
• TPPi(x,z)  
• NTPPi(x,z)

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
