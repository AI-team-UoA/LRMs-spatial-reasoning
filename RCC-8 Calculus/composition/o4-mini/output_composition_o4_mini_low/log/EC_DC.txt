PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:

  1. DC(x,z)  
  2. EC(x,z)  
  3. PO(x,z)  
  4. TPPi(x,z)   (i.e. z ⊏ x and z touches ∂x)  
  5. NTPPi(x,z)  (i.e. z ⊏ x and z does not touch ∂x)

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
