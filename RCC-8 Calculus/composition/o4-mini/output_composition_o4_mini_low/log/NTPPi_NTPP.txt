PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
The only RCC–8 relations that are possible between x and z (given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)) are

    PO(x,z)  
    TPP(x,z)  
    TPPi(x,z)  
    NTPP(x,z)  
    NTPPi(x,z)  
    EQ(x,z)
