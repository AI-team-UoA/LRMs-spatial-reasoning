PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:  
Given NTPP(x,y) (x is a non‑tangential proper part of y) and NTPPi(y,z) (i.e. NTPP(z,y)), both x and z lie strictly inside y without touching y’s boundary. Inside y they can stand in any of the eight RCC‑8 relations. Hence the possible relations between x and z are:

• DC(x,z)  
• EC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPP(x,z)  
• NTPP(x,z)  
• TPPi(x,z)  
• NTPPi(x,z)  
• EQ(x,z)
