PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The only constraints are that x must avoid y, but y sits inside z.  Hence x may lie entirely outside z (giving DC or EC) or it may overlap or lie within z’s “shell” outside y (giving PO, TPP or NTPP).  EQ, TPPi or NTPPi are ruled out.  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
