PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The fact that PO(x,y) tells us that x and y overlap but neither contains the other, and NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y) tells us that z is a non‐tangential proper part of y, allows z to lie anywhere inside y’s interior—possibly in that part of y that overlaps x, possibly in that part of y that lies outside x, or right up against x’s boundary.  Hence all of the following RCC‐8 relations between x and z can occur:

  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(z,x)  (equivalently TPPi(x,z))  
  • NTPP(z,x) (equivalently NTPPi(x,z))  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x)
