PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The easiest way to see what can happen to x and z is to note that both are proper (tangential) parts of y.  In particular

  TPP(x,y)    ⇒    x ⊊ y, ∂x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅  
  TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y)    ⇒    z ⊊ y, ∂z ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅  

Thus x and z each lie inside y (and each touches y’s boundary), but otherwise they can be  
  – completely separate (DC),  
  – touch (EC),  
  – overlap without one containing the other (PO),  
  – or one can itself be a (tangential or non‐tangential) proper part of the other.  

Checking the standard RCC–8 composition table for  
   TPP ∘ TPP⁻¹    
one finds exactly these five possibilities:  

  DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
