PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The fact that TPPi(x,y) means y TPP x (y is a tangential proper‐part of x), so y lies inside x touching x’s boundary.  Since y is DC from z, z must lie entirely in the complement of y, which comprises two disjoint regions:  
  1. outside x, or  
  2. inside x but outside y.  

Hence z can relate to x in exactly the following ways:  
  • DC(x,z)  
  • EC(x,z)  
  • PO(x,z)  
  • TPP(z,x) (≡ TPPi(x,z))  
  • NTPP(z,x) (≡ NTPPi(x,z))  

### Answer:  
{ DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) }
