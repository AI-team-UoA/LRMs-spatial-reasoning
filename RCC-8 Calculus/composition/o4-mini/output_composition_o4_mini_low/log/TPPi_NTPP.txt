PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given  
  1. TPPi(x,y)  ≡  TPP(y,x):  y is a tangential proper‐part of x  
  2. NTPP(y,z):       y is a non‐tangential proper‐part of z  

We want all RCC‐8 relations R(x,z) consistent with these.

Intuitively:  
– y sits against x’s boundary (so x barely “wraps” y)  
– y lies strictly inside z (with a positive gap to z’s boundary)  

Thus when comparing x and z:  
– x need not contain z (indeed z must “poke out” where y meets x’s boundary)  
– z might wrap all of x, or just overlap it, or wrap it tangentially or non‐tangentially  

One finds exactly three possibilities:  
  • NTPP(x,z): x ⊂ z, with x’s boundary strictly inside z  
  • TPP(x,z): x ⊂ z, with x’s boundary touching z’s boundary  
  • PO(x,z): x and z overlap but neither contains the other  

All other RCC‐8 relations between x and z are ruled out.  

### Answer:  
The only possible relations between x and z are  
  NTPP(x,z),  TPP(x,z),  or  PO(x,z).
