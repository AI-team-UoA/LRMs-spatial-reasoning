PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
Given only that DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), there is no further constraint on the relationship between x and z.  Therefore x and z can stand in any of the eight RCC‑8 relations:
   
   • DC(x,z)  
   • EC(x,z)  
   • PO(x,z)  
   • TPP(x,z)  
   • NTPP(x,z)  
   • TPPi(x,z)  
   • NTPPi(x,z)  
   • EQ(x,z)
