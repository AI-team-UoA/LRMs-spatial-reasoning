PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The fact that NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper non‑tangential part of x (so y⊂int(x)), together with DC(y,z) (y and z are disjoint), does not force z to lie entirely outside or entirely inside x.  z may

  • lie completely outside x ⇒ DC(x,z)  
  • touch x’s boundary from the outside ⇒ EC(x,z)  
  • overlap x without either being a part of the other ⇒ PO(x,z)  
  • lie entirely inside x, touching its boundary ⇒ TPP(z,x) which is TPPi(x,z)  
  • lie entirely inside x, not touching its boundary ⇒ NTPP(z,x) which is NTPPi(x,z)

Thus the possible RCC‑8 relations between x and z are:

  DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
