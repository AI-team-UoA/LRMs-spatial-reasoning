{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "### Answer:\nTPPi(x,z)\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:  \n- **TPPi(x,y)** means \\( y \\) is a tangential proper part of \\( x \\).  \n- **EQ(y,z)** implies \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) are spatially identical.  \n- Substituting \\( z \\) for \\( y \\) (since \\( y \\equiv z \\)) directly propagates the relationship: \\( z \\) becomes a tangential proper part of \\( x \\), which is equivalent to **TPPi(x,z)**.  \n\nNo other relations are possible because \\( z \\) inherits \\( y \\)'s spatial role entirely.", "elapsed-time": 46.6819634437561, "reasoning-tokens": 986, "completion-tokens": 1114}
