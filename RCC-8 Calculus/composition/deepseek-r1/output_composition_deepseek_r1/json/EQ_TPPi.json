{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "### Answer:\nTPPi(x,z)\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:  \n1. **EQ(x,y)** implies \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are identical.  \n2. **TPPi(y,z)** is equivalent to **TPP(z,y)**, meaning \\( z \\) is a tangential proper part of \\( y \\).  \n3. Since \\( x = y \\), substituting \\( y \\) with \\( x \\) in **TPP(z,y)** directly gives **TPP(z,x)**, which is equivalent to **TPPi(x,z)**.  \n\nThus, the only possible relation between \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) is **TPPi(x,z)**.", "elapsed-time": 34.43441557884216, "reasoning-tokens": 883, "completion-tokens": 1019}
