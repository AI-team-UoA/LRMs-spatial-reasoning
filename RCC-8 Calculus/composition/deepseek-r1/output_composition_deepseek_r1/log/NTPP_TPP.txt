PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
NTPP(x,z)

The reasoning is as follows: Since NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely inside y without touching its boundary, and TPP(y,z) means y is inside z but touches z's boundary. As x is entirely within y's interior (non-tangential), it cannot reach y's boundary (which touches z's boundary). Thus, x remains entirely within z's interior without touching z's boundary, resulting in NTPP(x,z).
