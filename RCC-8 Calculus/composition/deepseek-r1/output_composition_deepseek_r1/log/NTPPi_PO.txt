PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
The possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x). 

**Explanation:**  
- **NTPPi(x,y)** implies y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is entirely inside x without touching its boundary).  
- **PO(y,z)** means y and z partially overlap (share some interior but neither is a part of the other).  

Since y is entirely inside x, z must overlap with a part of x (the region containing y). However, z could:  
1. **Partially overlap x (PO(x,z))** if part of z is inside x (overlapping y) and part is outside.  
2. **Be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x))** if z is entirely inside x, overlaps y, and touches x’s boundary.  
3. **Be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x))** if z is entirely inside x, overlaps y, and does not touch x’s boundary.  

Relations like DC, EC, EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi are excluded because z must share some interior with x (due to PO(y,z) and y being inside x).
