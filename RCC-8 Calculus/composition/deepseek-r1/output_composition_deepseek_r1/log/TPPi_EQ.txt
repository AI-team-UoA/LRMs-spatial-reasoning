PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z)

The reasoning is as follows:  
- **TPPi(x,y)** means \( y \) is a tangential proper part of \( x \).  
- **EQ(y,z)** implies \( y \) and \( z \) are spatially identical.  
- Substituting \( z \) for \( y \) (since \( y \equiv z \)) directly propagates the relationship: \( z \) becomes a tangential proper part of \( x \), which is equivalent to **TPPi(x,z)**.  

No other relations are possible because \( z \) inherits \( y \)'s spatial role entirely.
