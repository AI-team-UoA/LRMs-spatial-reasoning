PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
TPP(x,z)

The reasoning is as follows:  
1. **EQ(x,y)** implies x and y are spatially identical.  
2. **TPP(y,z)** means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z, shares a boundary with z, and y ≠ z).  
3. Since x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), substituting x for y in TPP(y,z) directly gives **TPP(x,z)**.  
No other RCC-8 relations are possible because x inherits y’s properties entirely (due to EQ), and TPP is the only valid relation for x relative to z under these conditions.
