PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z)

The reasoning is as follows:  
1. **EQ(x,y)** implies \( x \) and \( y \) are identical.  
2. **TPPi(y,z)** is equivalent to **TPP(z,y)**, meaning \( z \) is a tangential proper part of \( y \).  
3. Since \( x = y \), substituting \( y \) with \( x \) in **TPP(z,y)** directly gives **TPP(z,x)**, which is equivalent to **TPPi(x,z)**.  

Thus, the only possible relation between \( x \) and \( z \) is **TPPi(x,z)**.
