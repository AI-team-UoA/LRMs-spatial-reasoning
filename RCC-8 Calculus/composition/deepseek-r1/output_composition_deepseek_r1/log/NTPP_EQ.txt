PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
NTPP(x,z)

The reasoning is as follows:  
- **NTPP(x,y)** means \( x \) is a non-tangential proper part of \( y \).  
- **EQ(y,z)** implies \( y \) and \( z \) are spatially identical.  
- Since \( x \) is entirely inside \( y \) (non-tangentially) and \( y = z \), \( x \) must also be a non-tangential proper part of \( z \).  
- No other RCC-8 relations (e.g., TPP, PO, DC) are possible because \( y = z \) preserves the spatial structure of \( x \) relative to \( z \).  

Thus, the only possible relation is **NTPP(x,z)**.
