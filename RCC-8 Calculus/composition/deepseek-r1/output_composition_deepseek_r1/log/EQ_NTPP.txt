PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
NTPP(x,z)

The reasoning is as follows:  
- **EQ(x,y)** means \( x \) and \( y \) are identical.  
- **NTPP(y,z)** means \( y \) is a non-tangential proper part of \( z \).  
- Since \( x \) and \( y \) are identical, \( x \) must also be a non-tangential proper part of \( z \).  
- No other RCC-8 relations are possible because \( x \) inherits \( y \)â€™s relationship to \( z \), and **NTPP** is the only relation consistent with this.
