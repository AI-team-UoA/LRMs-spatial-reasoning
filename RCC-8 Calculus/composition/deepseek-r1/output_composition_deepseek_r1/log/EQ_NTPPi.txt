PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
NTPPi(x,z)

The reasoning is as follows:
1. **EQ(x,y)** implies \( x \) and \( y \) are the same region.
2. **NTPPi(y,z)** is equivalent to **NTPP(z,y)**, meaning \( z \) is a non-tangential proper part of \( y \).
3. Since \( x = y \), \( z \) must be a non-tangential proper part of \( x \).
4. The inverse relation of **NTPP(z,x)** is **NTPPi(x,z)**.

Thus, the only possible relationship between \( x \) and \( z \) is **NTPPi(x,z)**.
