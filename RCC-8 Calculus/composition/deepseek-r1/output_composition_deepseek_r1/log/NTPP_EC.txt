PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
DC(x,z)

The relation between x and z must be DC (DisConnected). Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (entirely inside y and not touching its boundary), and y is externally connected to z (touching only at their boundaries), x cannot overlap with z or touch its boundary. Thus, x and z share no spatial parts.
