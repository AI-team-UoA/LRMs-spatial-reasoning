PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) holds, that means NTPP(y,x): y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e. y is wholly inside x, and their boundaries do not touch). If TPPi(y,z) holds, that means TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e. z is wholly inside y, but their boundaries do touch). Since y is wholly inside x (with some “gap” to x’s boundary) and z is wholly inside y (touching y’s boundary), z’s boundary is still strictly inside x. Therefore, z is also wholly inside x with no boundary contact. In RCC‐8 terms, that means z is a non‐tangential proper part of x, so the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
NTPPi(x,z).
