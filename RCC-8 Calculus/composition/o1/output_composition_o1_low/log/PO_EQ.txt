PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If PO(x,y) and y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), then y and z occupy the same exact region. Therefore, x stands in the exact same spatial relation to z as it does to y. Hence x and z must also partially overlap, so PO(x,z) holds (and no other RCC‚Äê8 relation is possible).

### Answer:
PO(x,z)
