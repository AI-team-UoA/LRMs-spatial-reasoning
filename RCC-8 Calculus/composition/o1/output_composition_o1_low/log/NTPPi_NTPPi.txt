PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) holds, then by definition y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is wholly inside x, with no boundary contact). Likewise, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Because z is wholly inside y, which in turn is wholly inside x (both with no boundary contact), z must also lie wholly inside x with no boundary contact. In RCC-8 terms, that makes z a non-tangential proper part of x, which is expressed as NTPPi(x,z). Consequently, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

NTPPi(x,z)

### Answer:
NTPPi(x,z)
