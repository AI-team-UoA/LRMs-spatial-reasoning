PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is strictly inside y (NTPP(x,y)) while z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y) ≡ TPPi(y,z)), then z must also lie wholly in y (but touch y’s boundary). Geometrically, x sits fully in the interior of y, and z sits in y but reaches y’s boundary. In that situation:

• z cannot be contained in x (so TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible).  
  - If z touched y’s boundary, it cannot lie entirely within x, which is strictly in y’s interior.  

• x and z may not intersect at all (DC), only meet at a boundary (EC), partially overlap (PO), or x may be wholly inside z (TPP or NTPP).  
  - TPP(x,z) can happen if the boundary of x coincides with part of the boundary of z.  
  - NTPP(x,z) can happen if x is strictly inside z without their boundaries coinciding.  

Hence, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.
