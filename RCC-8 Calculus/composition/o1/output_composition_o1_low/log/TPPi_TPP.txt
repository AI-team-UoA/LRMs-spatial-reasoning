PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPᵢ(x,y) holds, then by definition TPP(y,x) holds (i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x). Likewise, TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. From these two facts alone, one can deduce that x and z must at least share the region y in their intersection (so they cannot be DC or EC). Beyond ruling out DC and EC, however, no further constraint forces x and z to be one particular RCC‐8 relation. They may partially overlap (PO), one may be (tangentially or non‐tangentially) part of the other (TPP, TPPᵢ, NTPP, NTPPᵢ), or they may even coincide (EQ). Thus the possible relations between x and z are:

PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPᵢ, NTPPᵢ, or EQ.

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPᵢ, NTPPᵢ, or EQ.
