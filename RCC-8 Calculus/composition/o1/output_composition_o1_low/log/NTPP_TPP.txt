PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), then x is entirely inside the interior of y and does not touch y’s boundary. Meanwhile, if y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), y sits inside z but does touch z’s boundary. Since x is wholly in the interior of y (and hence does not reach y’s boundary), it cannot reach z’s boundary either. Therefore, x must also lie strictly within the interior of z (with no boundary contact). Thus, the only consistent relation is: NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
