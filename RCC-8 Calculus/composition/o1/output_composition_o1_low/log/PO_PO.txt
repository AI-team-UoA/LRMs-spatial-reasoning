PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the standard RCC‐8 “composition” rules, the relation PO∘PO admits exactly the following possibilities between the “outer” regions x and z:

• DC(x,z) — x and z are DisConnected  
• PO(x,z) — x and z Partially Overlap  
• NTPP(x,z) — x is a NonTangential Proper Part of z  
• NTPPi(x,z) — z is a NonTangential Proper Part of x  

Hence, if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are DC, PO, NTPP, or NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), PO(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
