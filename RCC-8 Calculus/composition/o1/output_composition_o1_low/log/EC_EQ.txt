PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), then y and z occupy exactly the same region. Therefore, any relationship x has to y carries over identically to z. Since EC(x,y) says x and y only share a boundary (i.e., they touch but do not overlap in their interiors), and y and z coincide, the same boundary-touching relationship must also hold between x and z. Consequently, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).

### Answer:
EC(x,z)
