PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x lies completely inside y and touches y’s boundary. If y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then y also lies completely inside z and does not touch z’s boundary. Since x cannot “skip over” y’s boundary to touch z’s boundary, it follows that x is also completely inside z without touching z’s boundary. Therefore, the only possible relation is:  
NTPP(x,z)

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
