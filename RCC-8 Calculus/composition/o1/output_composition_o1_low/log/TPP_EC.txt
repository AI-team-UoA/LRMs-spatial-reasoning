PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x is completely contained in y and touches y’s boundary. Meanwhile, y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), meaning y and z share a boundary but do not overlap in their interiors. Since x is wholly contained in y (with x possibly also on y’s boundary), x cannot share interior points with z (because y and z do not share interior points); however, x could lie exactly on the boundary that y shares with z. Thus, the only possibilities are that x and z are either disconnected (DC(x,z)) or externally connected (EC(x,z)).  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z).
