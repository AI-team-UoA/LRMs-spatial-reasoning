PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)) and y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), then x could lie entirely outside both y and z; it could just touch z; it could partially overlap with z; or it could be contained within z (possibly touching or not touching zâ€™s boundary). However, x cannot contain z (because this would force x to overlap y via z) and x cannot coincide with z (EQ). Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
