PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)) and y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then x must also be strictly and wholly contained in z without touching its boundary. Therefore, the only consistent relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:
NTPP(x,z)
