PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is wholly contained in y and y is wholly contained in z, both without boundary contact. Consequently, x must also be wholly contained in z without boundary contact. Therefore, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:
NTPP(x,z)
