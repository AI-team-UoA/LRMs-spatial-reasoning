PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If one consults the standard RCCâ€‘8 composition tables, the composition of EC(x,y) (externally connected) with DC(y,z) (disconnected) yields DC(x,z) or EC(x,z). In other words, if x is externally connected to y, and y is disconnected from z, then x and z can either be disconnected or externally connected.

### Answer:
DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)
