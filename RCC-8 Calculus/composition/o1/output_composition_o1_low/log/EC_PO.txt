PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If one consults the standard RCC‑8 composition tables (or reasons about the geometry), EC(x,y) composed with PO(y,z) can yield exactly DC(x,z), EC(x,z), or PO(x,z). Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:  
• DC(x,z)  
• EC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  

### Answer: DC, EC, PO
