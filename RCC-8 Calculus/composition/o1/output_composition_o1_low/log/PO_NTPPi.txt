PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap (they share some interior but neither contains the other), and NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non‐tangential proper part of y—i.e., z is wholly inside y with no boundary contact.  

Because z lies strictly in the interior of y, x can either:

• Not intersect z at all (so x and z are DC),  
• Only touch z at a boundary inside y (so x and z are EC),  
• Partially overlap z (so x and z are PO),  
• Or possibly contain z (so from x’s perspective, z is a proper part of x).  

In RCC‐8, if z is a proper part of x, that relation is TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x). From x’s viewpoint these become TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) respectively, depending on whether z does or does not contact x’s boundary. Hence all of DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi are possible for (x,z).  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
