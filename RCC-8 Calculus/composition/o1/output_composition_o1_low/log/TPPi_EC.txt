PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

A concise way to see why virtually all RCC‒8 relations (except equality) can arise between x and z is to remember that:

• TPPi(x,y) says that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y ⊂ x and y’s boundary meets x’s boundary).  
• EC(y,z) says that y and z share a boundary but do not overlap in their interiors.

Because y “just touches” x on x’s boundary, and y also “just touches” z, there is ample freedom for z to lie (entirely or partially) inside x, outside x, or overlapping x in various ways, so long as y and z only share a boundary.  In all of these possibilities, the only relation that becomes impossible for x and z is EQ(x,z) (they cannot be identical).  All other RCC‒8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi) can be realized by suitable arrangements of the three regions.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
