PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)) and y partially overlaps z (PO(y,z)), then x could lie entirely in the “non‐overlapping” part of y (hence disjoint from z), could overlap with z, or could lie wholly in the portion of y that is inside z (hence x is a proper part of z). Concretely, the possible relations between x and z are:

• DC(x,z) (Disjoint)  
• PO(x,z) (Partial Overlap)  
• TPP(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part)  
• NTPP(x,z) (Non‐Tangential Proper Part)  

### Answer: DC, PO, TPP, NTPP
