PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) then y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is strictly contained in x with no shared boundary). Given also that DC(y,z) (y and z are disjoint), y being strictly inside x does not by itself constrain how x and z might interact—only that y and z share no points. Consequently, x and z may be disjoint, partially overlap, or z may be (tangentially or non‐tangentially) contained in x in a way that does not involve y. Concretely, the possible relations between x and z are:

• DC(x,z): x and z are disjoint.  
• PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (they share some common part that excludes y).  
• TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.  
• NTPPi(x,z): z is a non‐tangential proper part of x.

### Answer: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
