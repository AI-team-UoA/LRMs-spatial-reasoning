PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Because x and y coincide (EQ(x,y)), wherever “y” appears, one can substitute “x.” The statement TPPi(y,z) by definition is TPP(z,y); that is, z is a tangential proper part of y. But since y = x, it follows that z is a tangential proper part of x. Consequently, from the perspective of x, the relation to z is TPPi(x,z). There are no other possibilities consistent with RCC‐8.

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z).
