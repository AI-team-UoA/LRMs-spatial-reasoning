PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y and x are EC, then x only meets y along y’s boundary; there is no interior intersection between x and y. Meanwhile, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is wholly in the interior of y and does not even touch y’s boundary). Consequently, x, which lies “outside” y (except for boundary contact), cannot overlap or even touch z, which is fully contained within y’s interior. The only consistent relation is therefore DC(x,z). 

### Answer: DC(x,z)
