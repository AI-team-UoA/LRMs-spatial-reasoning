PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y)) then y is contained in x (all of y lies within x). Since y partially overlaps z (PO(y,z)), y and z share an interior region. Because y ⊆ x, that common interior region of y and z also lies in x; therefore, x and z must also overlap in their interiors. This rules out DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected) for x and z, and also rules out x being a proper part of z (since that would force y to be wholly in z, contradicting PO(y,z)). The remaining possibilities are:

• PO(x,z)  
• TPPi(x,z)  (which is TPP(z,x) in the usual RCC-8 notation)  
• NTPPi(x,z) (which is NTPP(z,x))  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
