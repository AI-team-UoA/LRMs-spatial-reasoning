PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) holds, then by definition y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is wholly in the interior of x). In particular, y does not even touch x’s boundary. Now EC(y,z) means that y and z share a boundary point but do not overlap in their interiors.

Since y is entirely in the interior of x and y and z at least touch in that interior region, z must “enter” that part of space occupied by x (otherwise it could not meet y’s boundary at all). Consequently, x and z cannot be DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected), because they necessarily share points in the interior of x. Nor can they be EQ (equal), because then y, which is strictly inside x, would also be strictly inside z, contradicting EC(y,z). 

What remains are precisely those relations in which x and z share interior points (PO = partially overlapping) or one is contained in the other (TPP / NTPP or their inverses). Concretely, the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z)  
• NTPP(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the answer is:

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPP(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).
