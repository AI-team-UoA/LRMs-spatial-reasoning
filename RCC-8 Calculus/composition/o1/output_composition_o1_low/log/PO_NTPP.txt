PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y), we know that x and y overlap properly (they share some interior but neither is contained in the other). At the same time, NTPP(y,z) tells us that y is a proper part of z (y is wholly inside z and does not touch z’s boundary). Because y is inside z, the portion of x that intersects y must also lie inside z. However, the part of x that lies outside y could, in principle, lie either inside or outside z. Thus x could end up entirely contained within z (making x a proper part of z) or only partially contained (so that x overlaps z but is not contained by it). Consequently, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z (consistent with PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)) are:  
• PO(x,z) (partial overlap)  
• TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part)  
• NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part)  

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z)
