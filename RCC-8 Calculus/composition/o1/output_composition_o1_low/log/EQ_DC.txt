PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since x and y coincide (EQ(x,y)), they form exactly the same region. Therefore, x and z must have the same relation as y and z. Since y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), it follows that x and z are also disconnected. 

### Answer:
DC
