PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then by definition, y is a tangential proper part of x (y touches x’s boundary) and z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z does not touch y’s boundary). Since z is wholly inside y and y itself only “just touches” x’s boundary, z cannot extend out to x’s boundary. Consequently, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. 

### Answer:
NTPP(x,z).
