PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y is a tangential proper part of x (that is, TPPi(x,y) ≡ TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x) and y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), then y and z do not intersect in any way (not even at the boundary). Because y ⊂ x, the fact that y and z are disjoint places no immediate restriction on how the remainder of x could interact with z, other than that any region of x that does intersect z must lie completely outside y.

Concretely:

• x and z may be completely disjoint (DC),  
• They may touch only at their boundaries (EC),  
• They may partially overlap (PO) in regions of x beyond y,  
• z may be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)), provided z’s interior is wholly contained in x but disjoint from y,  
• z may be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)), again disjoint from y within x.  

Relations such as TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would force x to be a proper part of z, hence forcing y (a subregion of x) to also intersect z. That would contradict DC(y,z). Likewise, EQ(x,z) would mean y is also part of z, violating DC(y,z).  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).
