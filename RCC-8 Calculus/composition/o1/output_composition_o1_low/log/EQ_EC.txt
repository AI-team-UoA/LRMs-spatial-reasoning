PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y are coincident (EQ) and y is externally connected to z (EC), then x and y occupy exactly the same region. Consequently, x and z must be externally connected as well (EC). No other RCC-8 relation is compatible with these premises.

EC
