PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(y,x)). Since EQ(y,z) means y and z coincide (y and z are the same spatial region), it follows that z is likewise a tangential proper part of x. In RCC-8 terminology (with x listed first), that is exactly TPPi(x,z). No other relation is consistent with these premises.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
