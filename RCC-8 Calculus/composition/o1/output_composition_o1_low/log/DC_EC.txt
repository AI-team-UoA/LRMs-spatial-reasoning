PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is DC from y and y is EC with z, then x and z can be DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP (but not TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ). The intuitive reason is that x can lie disjoint from z, merely touch z’s boundary, partially overlap with z, or be wholly contained in z (touching or not touching z’s boundary) without contradicting x’s disconnection from y and y’s external connection with z. However, x cannot contain z (as that would force x to share z’s boundary with y) nor can x coincide with z.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
