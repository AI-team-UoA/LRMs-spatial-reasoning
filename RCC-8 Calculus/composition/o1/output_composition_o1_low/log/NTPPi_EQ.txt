PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From NTPPi(x,y) we know that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e. NTPP(y,x)). If y and z coincide (EQ(y,z)), then z is likewise a non‐tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)). In RCC‐8 form, keeping x first and z second, that is NTPPi(x,z). There are no other possibilities in RCC‐8 under these assumptions.

### Answer:
NTPPi(x,z)
