PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y), x is disjoint from y; and given NTPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z not touching zâ€™s boundary. Because y is wholly in the interior of z, this places no restriction preventing x from being outside z (hence DC with z), merely touching z (EC), partially overlapping z (PO), or being contained in z (TPP or NTPP) without intersecting y. However, x cannot contain z (that would force x to contain y, contradicting DC(x,y)), nor can x coincide with z. Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
