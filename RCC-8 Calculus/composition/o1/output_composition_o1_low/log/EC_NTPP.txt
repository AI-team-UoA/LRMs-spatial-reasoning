PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x merely “touches” y from the outside (EC(x,y)), yet y sits wholly inside z without even touching z’s boundary (NTPP(y,z)), then x must at least reach into the interior of z in order to contact y.  In standard Euclidean‐type mereotopology, doing so rules out x being completely disjoint from z (DC) or identical to z (EQ), and similarly rules out z being part of x (which would contradict EC(x,y), since then y would also lie in x).  The only consistent ways for x to lie with respect to z (while still just tangentially meeting y) are:

• PO(x,z) – x partially overlaps z (e.g., x extends partly outside z but “dips in” far enough to touch y),  
• TPP(x,z) – x is wholly inside z and just touches z’s boundary (tangential proper part),  
• NTPP(x,z) – x is wholly inside z without touching z’s boundary (non‐tangential proper part).

Hence, the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), are PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
