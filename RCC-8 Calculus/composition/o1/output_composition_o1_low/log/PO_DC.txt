PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) (x partially overlaps y) and DC(y,z) (y is disconnected from z), observe that y and z share no points, yet x and y do share points. Because x neither contains y nor is contained by y (by the definition of PO), x must extend beyond the portion that overlaps y. There is no restriction preventing x from being disjoint from z, from just touching z, from partially overlapping z, or from containing z wholly (in which case z would be a proper part of x). Conversely, x cannot be wholly contained in z, because that would force the overlapping portion in y also to lie wholly in zâ€”which is impossible if y and z are disjoint. Nor can x and z coincide, because x overlaps y whereas z is disjoint from y.

Hence, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
