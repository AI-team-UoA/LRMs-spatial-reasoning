PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), by definition this is the same as NTPP(y,x).  That means “y is a non‐tangential proper part of x,” i.e., y is wholly contained in the interior of x and does not touch x’s boundary.

Next, TPP(y,z) means “y is a tangential proper part of z,” i.e., y is wholly contained in z but does touch z’s boundary.

Since y is wholly contained in x and also wholly contained in z (albeit touching z’s boundary), x and z must at least share the interior points of y.  Consequently, x and z cannot be:

• DC (disconnected) – they do share points (namely all of y).  
• EC (externally connected) – they share interior points (y), not just a boundary.
• EQ (equal) – if x were equal to z, then y could not be both NTPP of x and TPP of z at the same time.  

All other RCC‐8 relations remain admissible.  In other words, x and z may partially overlap, or one may be a proper part of the other (tangentially or non‐tangentially).  Hence, the possible relationships between x and z are:

PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
