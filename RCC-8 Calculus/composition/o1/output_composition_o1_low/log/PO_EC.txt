PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the standard RCC‐8 composition rules, the composition PO(x,y) ∘ EC(y,z) yields exactly three possibilities for the relationship between x and z: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), or PO(x,z). 

Hence the possible relationships are: DC, EC, PO.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), or PO(x,z).
