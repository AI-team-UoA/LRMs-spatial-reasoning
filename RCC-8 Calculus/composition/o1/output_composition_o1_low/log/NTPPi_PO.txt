PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,y) ≡ NTPP(y,x)) then y lies wholly inside x without even boundary contact. Next, y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), meaning they share some interior part but neither is contained in the other. Because y is strictly inside x, any overlap between y and z implies that x and z also overlap. In particular:

• x and z cannot be DC or EC, because y and z do share a region, and hence x and z must also share that region.  
• x cannot be a (tangential or non-tangential) proper part of z (TPP or NTPP), as that would force y to be contained in z, contradicting PO(y,z).  
• x and z cannot coincide (EQ) for the same reason: then y would be wholly inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).  

What remains possible is that x and z partially overlap (PO) or else z is a (tangential or non-tangential) proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi). Hence the possible relations between x and z are:  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPPi(x,z)  
• NTPPi(x,z)  

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z)
