PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since x and y coincide (EQ), x is indistinguishable from y. Therefore, x must relate to z exactly as y does. Since y and z partially overlap (PO), the only possible relationship between x and z is also PO.

### Answer:
PO(x,z)
