PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y are DC, it follows (in standard set‚Äêbased/RCC interpretations) that x and y share no points at all. Because TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y (tangentially) and is therefore wholly contained in y, it cannot overlap with or even touch x (since x does not meet y anywhere). Hence x and z must also be DC.

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
