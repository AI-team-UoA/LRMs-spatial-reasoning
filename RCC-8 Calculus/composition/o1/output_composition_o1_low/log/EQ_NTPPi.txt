PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Because x and y coincide (EQ(x,y)), replacing y by x in NTPPi(y,z) (which says that y contains z, with no boundary contact) immediately implies that x contains z with no boundary contact.  In RCC-8 terms, that is precisely the NTPPi relation.  Hence, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
