PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) holds, then y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is wholly inside x without touching the boundary). If NTPP(y,z) holds, then y is a non‐tangential proper part of z. From these two facts alone, x and z are guaranteed to share interior (since both contain y in their interiors) so they cannot be DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected). All remaining relations (PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ) are consistent with y being inside both x and z, depending on whether x is inside z, z is inside x, x partially overlaps z, or x equals z.

### Answer:
Possible relations between x and z are PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.
