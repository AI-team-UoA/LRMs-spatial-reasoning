PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a (non‐tangential) proper part of y, then x is wholly contained in the interior of y. Since y and z are disconnected (DC), they share no points in common. Consequently, x—which lies entirely within y—cannot share any points with z either. Hence x and z must also be DC.

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
