PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then z is strictly contained (non‐tangential proper part) in y, while x is completely outside y (disconnected from it). Since z lies wholly in the interior of y and x does not intersect y at all, there is no way for x and z to share any points. Consequently, the only possible RCC‐8 relation between x and z is DC.

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
