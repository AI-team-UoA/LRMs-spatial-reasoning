PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x partially overlaps y and y is a tangential proper part of z, then x must intersect the interior of z (since x and y share an interior region, and y ⊆ z). However, knowing only that x and y partially overlap (so neither x ⊆ y nor y ⊆ x) does not force x entirely inside z nor partially outside z. Consequently:

• x could be entirely contained in z, in which case x might be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)), depending on whether x touches z’s boundary.  
• x could also extend outside z while still intersecting it (through y), which would make x partially overlapping z (PO(x,z)).

No other RCC-8 relations are consistent with the premises, so the possibilities are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
