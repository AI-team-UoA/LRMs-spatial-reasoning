PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)) but y only partially overlaps z (PO(y,z)), then all we know for certain is that x ⊂ y and y ∩ z ≠ ∅ with neither y ⊂ z nor z ⊂ y. Under these conditions, the part of y that x occupies could lie:

• Completely outside z,  
• Exactly on the boundary of z,  
• Partly overlapping with z, or  
• Entirely within z (possibly touching z’s boundary or not).

Consequently, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:  
• DC(x,z) if x is in the portion of y disjoint from z,  
• EC(x,z) if x touches z only at a boundary,  
• PO(x,z) if x and z share some interior, but neither is contained in the other,  
• TPP(x,z) if x is wholly inside z and tangentially touches z’s boundary,  
• NTPP(x,z) if x is wholly inside z and does not touch z’s boundary.

No other relations are consistent with TPP(x,y) ∧ PO(y,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
