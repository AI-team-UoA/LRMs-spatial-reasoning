PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Below is a brief intuitive reasoning (in purely topological terms) showing that all eight RCC‐8 relations between x and z can arise under the assumptions TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

• TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and x’s boundary touches y’s boundary.  
• TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), so z is a proper part of y and z’s boundary touches y’s boundary.

Hence both x and z sit “inside” y and each touches y’s boundary.  Topologically, there is no constraint forcing x and z to be disjoint, to overlap, or to be one inside the other; all of these possibilities can be realized by suitable placements of x and z within y.  In particular:

1) They can be disjoint (DC).  
2) They can just touch each other (EC).  
3) They can partially overlap (PO).  
4) One can be a (tangential or non‐tangential) proper part of the other (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi), depending on whether they share a boundary point.  
5) They can coincide (EQ), if x and z happen to be the very same region.

Thus, every one of the eight RCC‐8 relations is consistent with the premises.  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z).
