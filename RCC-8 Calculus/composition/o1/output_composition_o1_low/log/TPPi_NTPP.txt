PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) (i.e., TPP(y,x)) then y is a tangential proper part of x (y ⊂ x and y’s boundary touches x’s boundary); and if NTPP(y,z) then y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y ⊂ z and y’s boundary does not touch z’s boundary). The key observations are:

• Because y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, the regions x and z must overlap (so DC(x,z) is impossible).  
• y’s boundary touches x but does not touch z, so x cannot share its boundary with z; otherwise y would also touch z’s boundary.

From these constraints, x can either be wholly contained in z without boundary contact (i.e., NTPP(x,z)), or it can be only partially inside z with some region extending outside (i.e., PO(x,z)). Thus the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are PO(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:
PO(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
