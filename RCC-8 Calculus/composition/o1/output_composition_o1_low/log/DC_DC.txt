PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is disconnected from y and y is disconnected from z, there is no direct constraint on the relationship between x and z. In other words, knowing only that DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), x and z could be in any of the eight possible RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.
