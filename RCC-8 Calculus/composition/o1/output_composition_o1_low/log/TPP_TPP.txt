PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then x is necessarily a proper part of z. However, it is not determined solely by “tangential” proper part relations whether x’s interior touches z’s boundary or not. Hence, x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

### Answer:
TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
