PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Below is a brief way to see why multiple outcomes are consistent with the RCC‐8 axioms.  We know:

• EC(x,y):  x and y are externally connected (they share a boundary but have no interior points in common).  
• TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is strictly contained in z but also shares part of its boundary with z).

We want all consistent RCC‐8 relations R(x,z).  A classical way to determine these systematically is via the RCC‐8 composition tables (which encode all allowable “compositions” of relations).  In fact, the standard composition of EC∘TPP (i.e., first EC with y, then TPP with z) admits the following possibilities for R(x,z):

• DC(x,z)  (Disconnected)  
• EC(x,z)  (Externally Connected)  
• PO(x,z)  (Partial Overlap)  
• TPP(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part)  
• NTPP(x,z) (Non‐Tangential Proper Part)

Intuitively, one can construct or imagine (sometimes highly “bent” or “ring‐shaped”) regions that realize each of these cases.  Hence the complete RCC‐8 answer is that R(x,z) can be DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
