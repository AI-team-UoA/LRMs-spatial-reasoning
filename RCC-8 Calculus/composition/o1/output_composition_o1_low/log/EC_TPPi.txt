PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is externally connected (EC) to y, then x and y share only a boundary and no interior points. Meanwhile, if TPPi(y,z), then—by definition—z is a tangential proper part of y (that is, z is wholly within y but also touches y’s boundary).

Because x lies outside y (except for boundary contact) and z lies inside y (except for boundary contact), x and z cannot share interior points. They might, however, share exactly the portion of y’s boundary where both x and z each contact y. Consequently, the only possible relations between x and z are that they are either disconnected (DC) if their boundary contacts with y do not coincide, or externally connected (EC) if they share exactly that boundary segment of y. No other RCC-8 relations can hold in this scenario.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
