PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From PO(x,y) we know that x and y overlap in their interiors but neither is a (proper) part of the other. From TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y), we know that z is a (tangential) proper part of y, so z is wholly contained in y (and touches y’s boundary). However, these facts alone do not pin down whether x and z overlap, are disjoint, merely touch, or whether x might even contain z. In particular:

• DC(x,z) is possible if x’s overlap with y does not happen to include z at all.  
• EC(x,z) is possible if x and z only touch at a boundary (no interior overlap).  
• PO(x,z) is possible if x and z share some interior region, but neither contains the other.  
• TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x) is possible if z lies completely inside x (touching x’s boundary).  
• NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x) is also possible if z lies completely inside x (without touching x’s boundary).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, or NTPPi.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
