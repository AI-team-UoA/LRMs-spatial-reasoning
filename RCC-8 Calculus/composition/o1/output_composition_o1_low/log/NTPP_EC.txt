PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), then x’s interior does not reach y’s boundary. Since y and z only touch at y’s boundary (EC(y,z)) and share no interior area, x remains fully contained inside y without touching y’s boundary, meaning that x cannot intersect or touch z. Thus, the only consistent relation between x and z is DC(x,z). 

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
