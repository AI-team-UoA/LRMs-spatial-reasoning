PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is disconnected from y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then y lies strictly within z (touching z’s boundary). Since x does not intersect y at all, x may or may not intersect (or be contained in) z, as long as x does not “bring in” y. Concretely, the only impossible cases would be those requiring z ⊆ x (because that would force y ⊆ z ⊆ x, contradicting DC(x,y)) or x = z. Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:  
• DC(x,z)  
• EC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPP(x,z)  
• NTPP(x,z)  

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
