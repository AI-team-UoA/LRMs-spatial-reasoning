PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x is wholly inside y but touches y’s boundary. If z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y)), then z is wholly inside y and does not touch y’s boundary. Under these conditions one can show that x cannot be a (tangential or non‐tangential) proper part of z (because that would force z to include the boundary portion of x, contradicting the fact that z does not meet y’s boundary). However, x and z can be disjoint, partially overlap, or z can be wholly inside x (tangentially or non‐tangentially). In RCC‐8 terms, the possible relations between x and z are:

• DC(x,z)  
• EC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPPi(x,z)  (i.e., TPP(z,x))  
• NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x))

Hence, these five are all the possible relationships consistent with TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
