PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x and z is a tangential proper part of y. Because z is contained in y, which in turn is contained in x, z must also be a proper part of x. However, we cannot be certain whether z’s boundary also touches x’s boundary (making it tangential) or not (making it non-tangential). Hence, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)
