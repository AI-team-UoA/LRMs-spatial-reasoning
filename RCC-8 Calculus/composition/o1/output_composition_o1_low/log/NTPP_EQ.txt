PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part (NTPP) of y, and y is identical to z (EQ), then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:
NTPP(x,z)
