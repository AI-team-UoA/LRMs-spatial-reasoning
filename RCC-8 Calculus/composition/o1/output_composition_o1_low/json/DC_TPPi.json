{"prompt": "If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x and y are DC, it follows (in standard set\u2010based/RCC interpretations) that x and y share no points at all. Because TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y (tangentially) and is therefore wholly contained in y, it cannot overlap with or even touch x (since x does not meet y anywhere). Hence x and z must also be DC.\n\n### Answer:\nDC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 28.6685311794281, "reasoning-tokens": 960, "completion-tokens": 1098}
