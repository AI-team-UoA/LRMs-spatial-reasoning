{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x = y and y is a non\u2010tangential proper part of z, then x must also be a non\u2010tangential proper part of z. Thus, NTPP(x,z) is the only possibility.\n\n### Answer:\nNTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 13.597906589508057, "reasoning-tokens": 384, "completion-tokens": 451}
