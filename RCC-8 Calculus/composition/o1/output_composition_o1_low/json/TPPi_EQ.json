{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(y,x)). Since EQ(y,z) means y and z coincide (y and z are the same spatial region), it follows that z is likewise a tangential proper part of x. In RCC-8 terminology (with x listed first), that is exactly TPPi(x,z). No other relation is consistent with these premises.\n\n### Answer: TPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 22.018865823745728, "reasoning-tokens": 1344, "completion-tokens": 1486}
