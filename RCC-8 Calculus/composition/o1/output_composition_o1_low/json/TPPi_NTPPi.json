{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then by definition, y is a tangential proper part of x (y touches x\u2019s boundary) and z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z does not touch y\u2019s boundary). Since z is wholly inside y and y itself only \u201cjust touches\u201d x\u2019s boundary, z cannot extend out to x\u2019s boundary. Consequently, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. \n\n### Answer:\nNTPP(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 41.88106870651245, "reasoning-tokens": 2560, "completion-tokens": 2716}
