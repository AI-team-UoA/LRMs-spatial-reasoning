{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a non-tangential proper part of y and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is wholly contained in y and y is wholly contained in z, both without boundary contact. Consequently, x must also be wholly contained in z without boundary contact. Therefore, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nNTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 12.188446760177612, "reasoning-tokens": 512, "completion-tokens": 637}
