{"prompt": "If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)) and y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), then x must also be disconnected from z. Hence, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).\n\n### Answer: DC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 10.464089155197144, "reasoning-tokens": 384, "completion-tokens": 445}
