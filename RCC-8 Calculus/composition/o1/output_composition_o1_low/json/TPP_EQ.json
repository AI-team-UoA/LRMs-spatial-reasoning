{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "From TPP(x,y), we know x is a tangential proper part of y. From EQ(y,z), we know y and z are the same spatial region. Hence x is a tangential proper part of z. Therefore:\n\n### Answer:\nTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 9.826012372970581, "reasoning-tokens": 384, "completion-tokens": 450}
