{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Because x and y coincide (EQ(x,y)), wherever \u201cy\u201d appears, one can substitute \u201cx.\u201d The statement TPPi(y,z) by definition is TPP(z,y); that is, z is a tangential proper part of y. But since y = x, it follows that z is a tangential proper part of x. Consequently, from the perspective of x, the relation to z is TPPi(x,z). There are no other possibilities consistent with RCC\u20108.\n\n### Answer:\nTPPi(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 94.8038113117218, "reasoning-tokens": 1792, "completion-tokens": 1956}
