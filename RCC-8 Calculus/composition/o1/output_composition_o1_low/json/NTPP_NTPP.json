{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)) and y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then x must also be strictly and wholly contained in z without touching its boundary. Therefore, the only consistent relation is NTPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nNTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 16.076314210891724, "reasoning-tokens": 960, "completion-tokens": 1080}
