{"prompt": "If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "From NTPPi(x,y) we know that y is a non\u2010tangential proper part of x (i.e. NTPP(y,x)). If y and z coincide (EQ(y,z)), then z is likewise a non\u2010tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)). In RCC\u20108 form, keeping x first and z second, that is NTPPi(x,z). There are no other possibilities in RCC\u20108 under these assumptions.\n\n### Answer:\nNTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 65.74070310592651, "reasoning-tokens": 2496, "completion-tokens": 2655}
