{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since x and y coincide (EQ), x is indistinguishable from y. Therefore, x must relate to z exactly as y does. Since y and z partially overlap (PO), the only possible relationship between x and z is also PO.\n\n### Answer:\nPO(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 15.257195234298706, "reasoning-tokens": 512, "completion-tokens": 579}
