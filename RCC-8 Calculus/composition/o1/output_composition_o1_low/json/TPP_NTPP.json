{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x lies completely inside y and touches y\u2019s boundary. If y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then y also lies completely inside z and does not touch z\u2019s boundary. Since x cannot \u201cskip over\u201d y\u2019s boundary to touch z\u2019s boundary, it follows that x is also completely inside z without touching z\u2019s boundary. Therefore, the only possible relation is:  \nNTPP(x,z)\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 24.47450828552246, "reasoning-tokens": 1216, "completion-tokens": 1378}
