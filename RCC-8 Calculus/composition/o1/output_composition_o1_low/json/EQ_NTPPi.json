{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Because x and y coincide (EQ(x,y)), replacing y by x in NTPPi(y,z) (which says that y contains z, with no boundary contact) immediately implies that x contains z with no boundary contact.  In RCC-8 terms, that is precisely the NTPPi relation.  Hence, the only possible relationship between x and z is:\n\nNTPPi(x,z).\n\n### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 50.41203045845032, "reasoning-tokens": 1920, "completion-tokens": 2051}
