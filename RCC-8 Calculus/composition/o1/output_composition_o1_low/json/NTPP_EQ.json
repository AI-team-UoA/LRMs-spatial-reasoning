{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a non-tangential proper part (NTPP) of y, and y is identical to z (EQ), then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nNTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 5.460606098175049, "reasoning-tokens": 192, "completion-tokens": 267}
