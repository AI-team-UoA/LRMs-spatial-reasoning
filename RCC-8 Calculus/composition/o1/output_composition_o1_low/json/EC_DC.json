{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If one consults the standard RCC\u20118 composition tables, the composition of EC(x,y) (externally connected) with DC(y,z) (disconnected) yields DC(x,z) or EC(x,z). In other words, if x is externally connected to y, and y is disconnected from z, then x and z can either be disconnected or externally connected.\n\n### Answer:\nDC(x,z) or EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 50.04158139228821, "reasoning-tokens": 2496, "completion-tokens": 2626}
