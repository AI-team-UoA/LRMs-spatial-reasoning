{"prompt": "If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If PO(x,y) and y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), then y and z occupy the same exact region. Therefore, x stands in the exact same spatial relation to z as it does to y. Hence x and z must also partially overlap, so PO(x,z) holds (and no other RCC\u20108 relation is possible).\n\n### Answer:\nPO(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 8.020785808563232, "reasoning-tokens": 384, "completion-tokens": 473}
