{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x and y are coincident (EQ) and y is externally connected to z (EC), then x and y occupy exactly the same region. Consequently, x and z must be externally connected as well (EC). No other RCC-8 relation is compatible with these premises.\n\n### Answer:\nEC", "elapsed-time": 13.82508397102356, "reasoning-tokens": 448, "completion-tokens": 519}
