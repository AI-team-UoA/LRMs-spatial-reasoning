{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then x is necessarily a proper part of z. However, it is not determined solely by \u201ctangential\u201d proper part relations whether x\u2019s interior touches z\u2019s boundary or not. Hence, x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).\n\n### Answer:\nTPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 18.718282461166382, "reasoning-tokens": 576, "completion-tokens": 757}
