PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is strictly inside y (NTPP(x,y)) and y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), then x must also be disjoint from z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC. 

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
