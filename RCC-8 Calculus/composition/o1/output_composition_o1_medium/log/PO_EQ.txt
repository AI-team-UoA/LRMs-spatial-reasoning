PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Answer:

PO(x,z)

Explanation:

Since y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), they represent exactly the same region. Therefore any relationship that x has to y must hold the same way to z. Given that x partially overlaps y (PO(x,y))—i.e., they share some part but neither is a proper part of the other—the same must be true for x and z. Hence the only possible relationship is PO(x,z).
