PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), let us restate these in their “direct” forms:

• NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).  
  – This says y is a non‐tangential proper part of x; that is, y is wholly inside x and does not even touch x’s boundary.

• TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y).  
  – This says z is a tangential proper part of y; that is, z is wholly inside y but does touch y’s boundary.

Since y is wholly inside x (without boundary contact) and z is wholly inside y (just touching y’s boundary), z is necessarily still completely contained within x’s interior as well—and also cannot touch x’s boundary (because y itself does not reach x’s boundary). Consequently, z is a non‐tangential proper part of x. In RCC‐8 terms, “z is a non‐tangential proper part of x” is written as NTPP(z,x), which corresponds to NTPPi(x,z) when naming the relation from x to z.

Hence, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
NTPPi(x,z)
