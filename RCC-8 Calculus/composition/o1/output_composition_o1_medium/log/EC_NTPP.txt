PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the standard RCC‐8 composition tables (and by intuitive geometric reasoning) one finds that if x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)) and y is a non‐tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then x and z must either partially overlap or else x is also a proper part of z.  Concretely, the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:

• PO(x,z) (“partially overlaps”),  
• TPP(x,z) (“tangential proper part”),  
• NTPP(x,z) (“non‐tangential proper part”).  

No other RCC‐8 relations are consistent with these premises.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).
