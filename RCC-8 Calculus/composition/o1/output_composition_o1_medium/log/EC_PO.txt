PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, EC(x,y) says that x and y share a boundary but no interior points, and PO(y,z) says that y and z share interior points but neither is part of the other.  Under these conditions, x and z can be:

• DC(x,z) (“disconnected”): x and z may be completely disjoint.  
• EC(x,z) (“externally connected”): they may share a boundary but no interior.  
• PO(x,z) (“partially overlapping”): they may share interior points.  
• TPP(x,z) (“tangential proper part”): x may be contained in z, touching z’s boundary.  
• NTPP(x,z) (“non-tangential proper part”): x may be fully contained in z without touching z’s boundary.

The other three relations (TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are excluded because they would force x to include z (contradicting EC(x,y) and PO(y,z)), or coincide with z (which would contradict EC(x,y)).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).
