PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is equal to y (EQ(x,y)) and y partially overlaps z (PO(y,z)), then x must be in exactly the same spatial configuration with z as y is. Hence x also partially overlaps z (PO(x,z)). There are no other possibilities.

### Answer:
PO(x,z)
