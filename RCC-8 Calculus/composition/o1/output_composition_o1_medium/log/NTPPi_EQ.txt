PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) holds, then by definition y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(y,x)). Hence y is strictly contained in x with no boundary contact. Given EQ(y,z), regions y and z coincide. Substituting z for y preserves the containment and lack of boundary contact. Therefore, z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. In RCC-8 terms, that is precisely NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
