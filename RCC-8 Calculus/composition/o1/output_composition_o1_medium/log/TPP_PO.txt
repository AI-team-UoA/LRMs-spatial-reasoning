PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper part of y and that the boundary of x touches the boundary of y. Meanwhile, PO(y,z) means that y and z overlap but neither contains the other. Because x is contained in y (by virtue of being a proper part) but y only partially overlaps z, x may lie entirely outside z, partly overlap z, or be wholly inside z (possibly touching or not touching its boundary). Consequently, the possible relations between x and z are:  
• DC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPP(x,z)  
• NTPP(x,z)  

### Answer: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).
