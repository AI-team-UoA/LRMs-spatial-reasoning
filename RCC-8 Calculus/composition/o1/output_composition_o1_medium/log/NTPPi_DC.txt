PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) holds, then y is a (non‐tangential) proper part of x. In other words, y lies wholly inside x and does not touch x’s boundary. Given also that DC(y,z) holds, y and z share no common points (no boundary or interior).

For x and z to be consistent with both of those facts, z must neither contain y nor overlap it. Hence x–z could be:  
• DC(x,z): Disconnected (x and z share no points).  
• EC(x,z): Externally connected (x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior).  
• PO(x,z): Partially overlapping (x and z share some interior, but that interior does not include y).  
• TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z lies strictly within x, possibly touching x’s boundary), disjoint from y.  
• NTPPi(x,z): z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (z lies wholly within x, without contacting x’s boundary), disjoint from y.

Relations that would force z to include y (e.g., TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or EQ(x,z)) are excluded because that would contradict DC(y,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
