PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), then y is effectively the same region as z. Since x and y are externally connected (EC(x,y)), replacing y with the identical region z preserves the external connection. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

### Answer:
EC(x,z)
