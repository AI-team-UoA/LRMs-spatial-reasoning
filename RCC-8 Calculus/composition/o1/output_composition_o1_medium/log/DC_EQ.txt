PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since y and z are coincident (i.e., y and z are the exact same region), any region x that is disconnected from y must also be disconnected from z. Therefore, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
