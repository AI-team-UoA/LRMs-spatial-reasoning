PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is totally disjoint from y (DC(x,y)), and simultaneously z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (NTPPi(y,z) ≡ NTPP(z,y), so z ⊂ y with no boundary contact), then z is wholly contained in y. Any contact or overlap between x and z would necessarily imply that x intersects or touches y (since z ⊂ y), contradicting DC(x,y). Consequently, x and z must also be disjoint. Hence the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
