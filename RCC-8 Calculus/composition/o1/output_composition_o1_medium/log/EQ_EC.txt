PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y are equal (EQ(x,y)), they occupy the exact same region. Since y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), and x and y are the same object, x and z must likewise be externally connected. No other RCC‚Äê8 relations can apply in this scenario. 

### Answer: EC(x,z)
