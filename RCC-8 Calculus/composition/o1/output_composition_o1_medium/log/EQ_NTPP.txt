PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since x and y coincide, any spatial relation that holds between y and z must also hold between x and z. Therefore, if NTPP(y,z) and EQ(x,y), then the only possible relation is:  
â€¢ NTPP(x,z)  

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
