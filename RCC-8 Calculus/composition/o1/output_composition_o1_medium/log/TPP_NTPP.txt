PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x is fully contained in y and just touches y’s boundary. Since y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), y is fully contained in z’s interior with no boundary contact. Therefore, x (which lies within y and touches y’s boundary) must also lie completely inside z, with no boundary contact with z. This implies x is a non-tangential proper part of z.  

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
