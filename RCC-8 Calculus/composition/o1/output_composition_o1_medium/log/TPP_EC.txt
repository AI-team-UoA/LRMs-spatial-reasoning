PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x’s interior lies within y, but x and y share a boundary point. Meanwhile, if y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), they share only a boundary point (no interior). Because x’s interior sits wholly inside y (and TPP ensures it touches y’s boundary), the only ways x could relate to z are:

• DC(x,z) (disconnected), if x is “away” from y’s boundary that meets z,  
• EC(x,z) (externally connected), if x exactly lines up with the boundary that y and z share.  

No other RCC-8 relation is possible, because y and z do not share interiors, so x (being contained in y) cannot share an interior with z or be a part of it.  

### Answer: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)
