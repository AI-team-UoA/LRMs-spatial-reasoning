PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y whose boundary touches y’s boundary; and given NTPPi(y,z), which is the same as NTPP(z,y), z is a proper part of y whose boundary does not touch y’s boundary.  In other words:

• x < y, and ∂x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅  (tangential proper part)  
• z < y, and ∂z ∩ ∂y = ∅  (non‐tangential proper part)

Because both x and z are contained in y—but x meets y’s boundary while z does not—the following analysis shows which of the eight RCC‐8 relations between x and z are possible (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ):

1) DC(x,z): Disconnected.  
   x can lie near y’s boundary and z deep in y’s interior. They can avoid overlapping or even touching altogether.  
2) EC(x,z): Externally connected.  
   It is possible for x’s interior to extend enough into y so that x and z touch only at a boundary with no interior overlap.  
3) PO(x,z): Partially overlapping.  
   They may share some interior points inside y.  
4) TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z):  
   For x to be a proper part of z, x would have to lie entirely inside z; but x’s boundary already meets y’s boundary while z does not. This is a contradiction, so TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible.  
5) TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x):  
   These require z < x. Since x could extend sufficiently into the interior of y, it is possible for z to lie entirely inside x. Whether z’s boundary meets x’s boundary (TPPi) or not (NTPPi) is unconstrained by x’s tangential contact with y, so both are possible.  
6) EQ(x,z): Equality.  
   x cannot equal z because x meets y’s boundary while z does not.

Hence the only possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:  
• DC(x,z)  
• EC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPPi(x,z) (i.e. TPP(z,x))  
• NTPPi(x,z) (i.e. NTPP(z,x))

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
