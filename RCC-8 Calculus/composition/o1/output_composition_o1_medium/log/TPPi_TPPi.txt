PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then by definition y is a tangential proper part of x and z is a tangential proper part of y. Since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, z must also be a proper part of x. However, whether z’s boundary touches x’s boundary or not is not determined by these two premises alone. Accordingly, z can be either a tangential proper part (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part (NTPP) of x.  

### Answer:
TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
