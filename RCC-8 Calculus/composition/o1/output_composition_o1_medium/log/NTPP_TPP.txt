PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Because x is strictly contained in y without touching y’s boundary (NTPP(x,y)), and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), x is wholly in the interior of y, which is itself wholly in z but touching z’s boundary at least at one point. Consequently, x cannot “reach” z’s boundary and so cannot be a tangential part of z. The only consistent possibility is that x is also a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
