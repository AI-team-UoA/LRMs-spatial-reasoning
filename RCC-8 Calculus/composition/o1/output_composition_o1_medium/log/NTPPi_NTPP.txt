PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From NTPPi(x,y) we know that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e., y ⊂ x with no boundary contact). From NTPP(y,z) we know that y is a non‐tangential proper part of z (y ⊂ z with no boundary contact). Hence y lies strictly in the interior of both x and z.

Because x and z both strictly contain y, they necessarily share an interior region (namely y). This rules out “DC” (disconnected) or “EC” (externally connected) for x and z, since in neither of those cases would x and z share an interior. However, x could be strictly contained in z (tangentially or non‐tangentially), z could be strictly contained in x (tangentially or non‐tangentially), x could partially overlap z without one containing the other, or they could even coincide (EQ). Therefore, the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:  
• PO(x,z) (partially overlapping),  
• TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z),  
• NTPP(x,z) (x is a non‐tangential proper part of z),  
• TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x),  
• NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non‐tangential proper part of x),  
• EQ(x,z) (x and z coincide).

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z).
