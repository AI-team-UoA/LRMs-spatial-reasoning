PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y), x is a non-tangential proper part of y (so x is wholly inside y without boundary contact). Meanwhile, NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP, which implies that y is a non-tangential proper part of z (so y is wholly inside z without boundary contact). Because x is strictly inside y and y is strictly inside z (with each boundary strictly contained in the interior of the next region), x must also lie strictly inside z with no boundary contact. Therefore, the only consistent relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:
NTPP(x,z)
