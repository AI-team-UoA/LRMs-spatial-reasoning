PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then y is a non‐tangential proper part of x, and z is a non‐tangential proper part of y. Because y is wholly inside x without touching its boundary, and z is wholly inside y without touching its boundary, it follows that z is also wholly inside x without touching x’s boundary. In RCC‐8 terms, z is thus a non‐tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
