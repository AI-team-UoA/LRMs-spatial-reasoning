PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From TPPi(x,y) we know that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(y,x)), so y lies completely in x and touches x’s boundary. From NTPP(y,z) we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y lies completely in z and does not touch z’s boundary. Consequently, x and z must at least share the interior region y. This rules out the possibilities DC(x,z) (“disconnected”) and EC(x,z) (“externally connected”), since x and z do share a nonempty interior (namely, y). It also rules out EQ(x,z) (“equal”), since from y’s point of view x and z behave differently (tangential vs. non-tangential), and it rules out z being a part of x (because then y could not be tangent to x while strictly inside z).

What remains consistent are:

• PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (they share y in their interiors but neither contains the other).
• TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x lies wholly within z, and x’s boundary touches z’s boundary).
• NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x lies wholly within z, and x’s boundary does not touch z’s boundary).

Hence the possible relations between x and z are PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
