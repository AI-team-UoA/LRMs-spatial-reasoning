PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) holds, then y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e. TPP(y,x)). Likewise, if NTPPi(y,z) holds, then z is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e. NTPP(z,y)). Putting these together:

• y < x (with boundary contact)  
• z < y (with no boundary contact)

Since z < y < x, it also follows that z < x. The only question is whether z touches x’s boundary or not. However, because z is strictly in the interior of y (no boundary contact with y) and y’s boundary coincides (at least partially) with x’s boundary, z cannot “skip” around y’s boundary to contact x’s boundary. Hence z must also lie entirely in the interior of x. Consequently, the only consistent RCC-8 relation between x and z is:

NTPPi(x,z)

which is the inverse of “z is a non-tangential proper part of x.” 

### Answer:
NTPPi(x,z)
