PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is externally connected to y, and y is externally connected to z, then by the usual RCC-8 composition rules (and by constructing suitable geometric examples), x and z can only be:  
• DC(x,z) (disconnected),  
• EC(x,z) (externally connected), or  
• PO(x,z) (partially overlapping).  

No other RCC-8 relations (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) can arise from EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).  

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), or PO(x,z).
