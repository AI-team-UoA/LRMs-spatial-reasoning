PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since y and z share the same spatial region under EQ(y,z), any tangential proper part x of y remains a tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).

### Answer:
TPP(x,z)
