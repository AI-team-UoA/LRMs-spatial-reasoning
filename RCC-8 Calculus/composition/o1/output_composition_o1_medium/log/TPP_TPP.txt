PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is TPP(y) and y is TPP(z), then x is necessarily a proper part of z but it may or may not contact zâ€™s boundary. Thus, the only possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:
TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
