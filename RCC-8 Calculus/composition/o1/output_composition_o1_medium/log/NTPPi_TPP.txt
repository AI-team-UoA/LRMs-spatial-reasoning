PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

A concise way to see why the answer must allow for several possibilities is to note that:

• NTPPi(x,y) says that y is a proper part of x with no boundary‐contact (i.e., y is wholly inside x).  
• TPP(y,z) says that y is a proper part of z and does touch z’s boundary at least at one point.

Because y sits strictly inside x yet “reaches” the boundary of z, z cannot be strictly “outside” or disjoint from x.  In fact, it turns out one can construct consistent geometrical configurations in which:

1) x and z overlap in just enough of a region to contain y (so x and z are PO), or  
2) z lies entirely inside x, either just touching x’s boundary (TPPi(x,z)) or not touching x’s boundary (NTPPi(x,z)).

All other RCC‐8 relations either contradict the fact that y (inside x) must also contact the boundary of z, or contradict the fact that y shares interior with both x and z.  Consequently, the only possible relations between x and z are:

• PO(x,z),  
• TPPi(x,z)  (i.e. TPP(z,x)),  
• NTPPi(x,z) (i.e. NTPP(z,x)).

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
