PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the fact that x partially overlaps y (PO(x,y)) we know that x ∩ y ≠ ∅, yet neither x ⊂ y nor y ⊂ x. Meanwhile, y being disconnected from z (DC(y,z)) means y ∩ z = ∅. For x and z to share some interior region, the portion of x that does not lie within y could potentially intersect z; or x might simply not intersect z at all, touch it only at a boundary, or contain z (or be contained by z) in a way that avoids forcing y and z to overlap. Analyzing all eight RCC-8 relations under these constraints shows:

• DC(x,z) is possible: x can avoid intersecting z entirely outside of y.  
• EC(x,z) is possible: x and z can just touch boundaries outside of y.  
• PO(x,z) is possible: x and z can partially overlap outside of y.  
• TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible: if x were wholly inside z, then y ∩ x ⊆ y ∩ z ≠ ∅, contradicting DC(y,z).  
• TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible: z can be wholly inside x (tangentially or non-tangentially) in a region that does not intersect y.  
• EQ(x,z) is impossible: if x = z, then y ∩ z = y ∩ x ≠ ∅, contradicting DC(y,z).  

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, or NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).
