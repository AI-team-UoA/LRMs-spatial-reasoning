PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If EQ(x,y) holds, then x and y are the very same region. The statement NTPPi(y,z) by definition means NTPP(z,y) (that is, z is a non-tangential proper part of y). But since x = y, it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. In RCC-8 terminology, that means from x’s perspective, x is the “larger” region containing z strictly in its interior without sharing a boundary. The name for that relation is NTPPi(x,z). There are no other possibilities consistent with z being a non-tangential proper part of y when x and y coincide.

### Answer:
NTPPi(x,z)
