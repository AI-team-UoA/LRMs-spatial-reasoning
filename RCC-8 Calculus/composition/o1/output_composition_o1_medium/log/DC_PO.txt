PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is disconnected from y, but y partially overlaps z, then x cannot contain z (because that would force x to overlap y through z) nor can x be equal to z (because then x would overlap y). All other possibilities remain consistent with the given information. Hence, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z)
