PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the usual RCC‐8 composition tables (and by considering the topological possibilities directly), one finds that if x partially overlaps y (PO(x,y)) and y is externally connected to z (EC(y,z)), then x and z can be:

• DC(x,z)  (disconnected)  
• EC(x,z)  (externally connected)  
• PO(x,z)  (partially overlapping)  
• TPPi(x,z)  (z is a tangential proper part of x)  
• NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non‐tangential proper part of x)

In other words, there is no constraint forcing x to overlap, touch, or exclude z, nor is there a constraint preventing z from being wholly inside x (while still only “touching” y from within x). Hence all five of these relations are consistent with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).
