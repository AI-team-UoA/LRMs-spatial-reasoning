PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
Given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), x and y are disjoint, and y is wholly inside z (without touching z’s boundary). Because y’s being inside z places no restriction on where x lies relative to z (beyond x not intersecting y), x can be:  
• Completely outside z (DC(x,z)),  
• Touching z at the boundary only (EC(x,z)),  
• Partially overlapping z (PO(x,z)),  
• Wholly inside z and touching z’s boundary (TPP(x,z)), or  
• Wholly inside z without touching z’s boundary (NTPP(x,z)).  

Thus the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.
