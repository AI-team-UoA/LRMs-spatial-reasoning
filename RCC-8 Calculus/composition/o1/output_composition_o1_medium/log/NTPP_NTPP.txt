PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x must also lie fully within z without touching zâ€™s boundary. Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
