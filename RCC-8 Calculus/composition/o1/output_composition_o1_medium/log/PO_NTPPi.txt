PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From PO(x,y) we know that x and y share some interior but neither is contained in the other. From NTPPi(y,z) we know (by definition of the inverse) that NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y and is entirely in yâ€™s interior.

Because z is wholly inside y, it may or may not intersect the portion of x that lies inside y. Consequently, x and z can be completely disjoint (DC), merely touch (EC), partially overlap (PO), or it could happen that z is entirely inside x (making z a tangential (TPPi) or non-tangential (NTPPi) proper part of x). The only relations ruled out are ones requiring x to be inside z (since x is not contained by y) or for x to be equal to z. 

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are: 
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, or NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).
