PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

A convenient way to see why there is more than one possibility is to note that if y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then y is wholly contained in z but shares (part of) its boundary with z.  Meanwhile, x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), so x and y share only a boundary (no interior points).  The key is to realize that the shared x–y boundary may lie wholly inside z’s interior, may coincide with z’s own boundary, or some mix of these—and in each geometric configuration, x can relate differently to z.  

In fact, one finds (either by case‐by‐case geometric reasoning or by consulting the standard RCC‐8 composition tables) that the following four relations are all consistent with EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z):  
• EC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPP(x,z)  
• NTPP(x,z)  

Thus, those are exactly the possible RCC‑8 relations that x can bear to z under the given conditions.

### Answer:
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).
