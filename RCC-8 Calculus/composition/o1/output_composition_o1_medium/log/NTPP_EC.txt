PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), x lies wholly in the interior of y and does not even meet y’s boundary. Meanwhile, if y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), y and z only meet at their boundary and share no interior points. Since x is confined entirely to y’s interior away from y’s boundary, it cannot intersect z (which only meets y at the boundary). Therefore, x and z must be disconnected (DC).

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
