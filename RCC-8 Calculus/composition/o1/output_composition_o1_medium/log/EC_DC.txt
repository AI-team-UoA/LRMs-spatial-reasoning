PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y are externally connected (EC) and y and z are disconnected (DC), then by the standard RCC‐8 composition table (or by direct geometric reasoning) the possible relations between x and z are:  
• DC(x, z)  
• EC(x, z)  
• PO(x, z)  
• TPPi(x, z)  (i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x)  
• NTPPi(x, z) (i.e., z is a non‐tangential proper part of x)  

No other RCC‐8 relations are consistent with EC(x, y) and DC(y, z).  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).
