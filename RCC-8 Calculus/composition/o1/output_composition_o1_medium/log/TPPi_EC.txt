PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the RCC‐8 definitions, “TPPi(x,y)” means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is wholly inside x but touches x’s boundary).  Also, “EC(y,z)” means y and z share (part of) their boundaries but have no interior points in common.  The question is then: given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), what can x and z be?

A useful way to see why multiple relationships are possible is to imagine x as a large region, y as a smaller region nested (tangentially) inside x, and z as some region that touches y’s boundary externally.  Because y is inside x, for y and z even to “touch” at a boundary, z must intersect or at least come up to where y sits inside x (either from within x or from outside).  One then checks consistency with each RCC‐8 relation x–z in turn.  A brief outline:

• DC(x,z) (disconnected): not possible, because if z is truly disjoint from x, it cannot meet y’s boundary inside x.  

• EC(x,z) (externally connected): possible if the boundary of y coincides with the boundary of x, and z lies outside x but also meets that same boundary.  In that case x and z share (part of) a boundary “through” y.  

• PO(x,z) (partial overlap): possible if z partly extends into the interior of x (so x and z share interior points) yet still only touches y at y’s boundary.  

• TPP(x,z) (x tangential proper part of z): conceivable if x is itself (tangentially) contained in a still larger region z, in such a way that y’s boundary is also (externally) tangent to z.  

• NTPP(x,z) (x non‐tangential proper part of z): not possible under these conditions, because if x were wholly inside z without touching z’s boundary, there would be no way for y (inside x) to “reach out” and be only boundary‐tangent to z.  

• TPPi(x,z) (z tangential proper part of x): possible if z is another object inside x that itself touches x’s boundary.  Then y (also inside x) can be tangential to z.  

• NTPPi(x,z) (z non‐tangential proper part of x): likewise possible if z lies wholly within x (not touching x’s boundary) and simply meets y along a boundary inside x.  

• EQ(x,z) (they coincide): impossible, as that would force y to be a proper part of x but also merely boundary‐touching z when z = x.

Collecting only the consistent cases gives:  
EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi.
