PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)) and y is the (inverse) tangential proper part of z (TPPi(y,z) ≡ TPP(z,y)), the only relation ruled out between x and z is equality (EQ). The key observation is that x is wholly inside y’s interior (no boundary contact with y), while z is also inside y but tangentially (touching y’s boundary). These facts do not, however, impose a strict containment or separation of x and z: x could be disjoint from z, tangent to z, partially overlapping z, contained in z, or contain z. Hence every RCC‑8 relation other than EQ is possible:

• DC(x,z)  
• EC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPP(x,z)  
• NTPP(x,z)  
• TPPi(x,z)  
• NTPPi(x,z)  

EQ(x,z) is impossible because x has no boundary contact with y while z does.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi
