PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From EQ(x,y) we know that x and y coincide. The condition TPPi(y,z) is defined to be the same as TPP(z,y), i.e., “z is a tangential proper part of y.” Since y and x are identical, this implies that z is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)). Equivalently, viewed as a relation R(x,z), this is TPPi(x,z). There are no other possibilities because z must be a proper part (so not PO) and must touch x’s boundary (which rules out NTPP/NTPPi).  

### Answer:
TPPi(x,z)
