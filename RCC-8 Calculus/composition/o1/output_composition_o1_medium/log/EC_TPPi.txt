PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the fact that x and y merely share a common boundary (EC(x,y)) and that z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y), i.e. TPPi(y,z)), one can arrange the geometry so that x and z either touch at the same boundary of y or lie disjoint from one another (if they contact different boundary portions of y). Accordingly, the only consistent RCC‚Äê8 relations between x and z are DC(x,z) or EC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z).
