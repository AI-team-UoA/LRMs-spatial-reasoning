PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

First, recall what NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) mean in RCC‐8:

• NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(y,x).  So NTPPi(x,y) says that y is a Non‐Tangential Proper Part of x; in other words, y is wholly inside x and does not touch x’s boundary.  
• EC(y,z) says that y and z are “externally connected,” i.e., they share a boundary portion but do not overlap in their interiors.

Given NTPPi(x,y), region y lies strictly in the interior of x (with a “margin” so that y’s boundary does not meet x’s boundary).  Next, y is EC with z, so y’s boundary touches z’s boundary (and they do not share interior points).  Crucially, because y is wholly inside x (and does not even touch x’s boundary), that boundary‐to‐boundary contact between y and z must lie in the interior of x.  

From x’s point of view, z could either:

1) Lie wholly inside x as well (so that z is also a part of x),  
2) Extend partly or mostly outside x, sharing some interior overlap with x.  

In RCC‐8 terms, the principal possibilities then boil down to whether z is wholly contained in x (possibly touching x’s boundary or not) or only partly overlaps x.  Concretely, the following three relations can arise between x and z:

• NTPPi(x,z) if z also lies wholly in the interior of x without touching x’s boundary.  
• TPPi(x,z) if z again lies as a proper part of x but this time is “tangential,” i.e., z’s boundary touches x’s boundary.  
• PO(x,z) if z extends (at least partially) outside x in such a way that they share interior points (i.e., they overlap), but neither is a part of the other.

No other RCC‐8 relations are consistent with the given constraints.  In particular, DC(x,z) (disconnected) is impossible because, via y, there is at least a boundary‐point of z lying in x, and EQ(x,z) is ruled out by the fact that y is a proper part of x but touches z only on a boundary.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:  
• NTPPi(x,z),  
• TPPi(x,z),  
• PO(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or PO(x,z).
