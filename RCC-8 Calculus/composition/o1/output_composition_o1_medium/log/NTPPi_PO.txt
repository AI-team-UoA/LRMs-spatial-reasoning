PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,y)), that means y lies wholly in the interior of x. Next, y partially overlaps z (PO(y,z)), so y and z share some interior region but neither contains the other. Because y is wholly inside x, any shared region of y and z also lies in x. Thus, x and z certainly share some interior (they cannot be DC or EC). Furthermore:

• x cannot be a proper part of z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)) because then y would also be a part of z, contradicting PO(y,z).  
• x and z cannot coincide (EQ) because then y would be a part of z, again contradicting PO(y,z).

This leaves three possibilities for x–z:  
1) PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (neither is contained in the other).  
2) TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z lies inside x, touching x’s boundary).  
3) NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z lies wholly in the interior of x).

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
