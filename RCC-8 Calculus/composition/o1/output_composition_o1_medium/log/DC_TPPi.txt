PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that DC(x,y) means x and y share no points (not even boundary points), and TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is wholly contained in y and touches y’s boundary, any point of z is also a point of y. Since x and y do not overlap or even touch, x cannot share any interior or boundary points with z (because z’s points lie entirely in y). Therefore, x and z must also be disconnected. 

### Answer: DC(x,z)
