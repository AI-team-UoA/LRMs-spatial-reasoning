PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y), x and y only coincide on their boundary and do not share any interior points. Also, from NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y), it follows that z is wholly contained in y but does not reach y’s boundary. Because x only “touches” y at y’s boundary while z stays strictly inside y, x and z cannot intersect or even touch. Therefore, x and z must be disconnected (DC). No other RCC-8 relation is possible under these conditions.
