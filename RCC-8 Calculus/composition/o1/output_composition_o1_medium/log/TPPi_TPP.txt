PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y) = TPP(y,x)) and y is also a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then y is contained in (and touches the boundary of) both x and z. This forces x and z to share an interior region (namely y), so they cannot be DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected). All other RCC-8 relations remain possible. In other words, x and z could be partially overlapping (PO), one could be (tangential or non-tangential) a proper part of the other (TPP/NTPP or TPPi/NTPPi), or they could be equal (EQ). 

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z).
