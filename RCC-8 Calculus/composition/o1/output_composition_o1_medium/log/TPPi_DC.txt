PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), we know by definition that TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). In other words, y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is strictly contained in x (and touches x’s boundary). In addition, DC(y,z) says that y and z are disconnected and share no points.

We now look at all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z under these conditions:

1) DC(x,z). Possible. Since y is inside x, z could simply lie entirely outside x so that x and z do not intersect. That would still be consistent with y and z being disconnected.

2) EC(x,z). Possible. x and z may only touch at a boundary, with no interior in common. Since y is fully inside x, there is no reason it must intersect z.

3) PO(x,z). Possible. x and z may share some (interior) region in common, but that common region need not include y. Thus, y can remain disconnected from z.

4) TPP(x,z). Not possible. TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is wholly inside z (possibly touching z’s boundary). Since y is inside x, y would also lie inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5) NTPP(x,z). Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z). If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then y (inside x) would also lie inside z, again contradicting DC(y,z).

6) TPPi(x,z). Possible. TPPi(x,z) (i.e., TPP(z,x)) means z is a tangential proper part of x. In that case z is wholly inside x (touching x’s boundary), but can still be spatially disjoint from y (also inside x), maintaining DC(y,z).

7) NTPPi(x,z). Possible. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, it can lie fully in x’s interior, also staying disjoint from y. Thus DC(y,z) holds.

8) EQ(x,z). Not possible. If x and z were identical, y (being a proper part of x) would necessarily be contained in z, contradicting DC(y,z).

Hence the possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).
