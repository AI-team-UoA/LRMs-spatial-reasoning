PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x partially overlaps y (PO(x,y)) and y is the “larger” region in a tangential‐proper‐part relation with z (TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y)), then z lies wholly inside y (touching y’s boundary) while x only partially intersects y. From this alone, x might or might not intersect z in any number of ways, including completely containing z, just touching z, or missing z entirely. The corresponding RCC‐8 relations consistent with these possibilities are:

• DC(x,z)  (x and z are disjoint)  
• EC(x,z)  (x and z only share a boundary)  
• PO(x,z)  (x and z partially overlap)  
• TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x)  
• NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non‐tangential proper part of x)  

No other RCC‐8 relations are consistent with PO(x,y) & TPPi(y,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
