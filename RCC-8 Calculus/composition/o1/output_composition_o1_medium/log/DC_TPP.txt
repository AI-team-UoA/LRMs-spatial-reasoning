PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y), we know x and y share no points (neither interior nor boundary). Meanwhile TPP(y,z) implies that y is a proper part of z, with y’s boundary touching z’s boundary. Because y ⊂ z, the fact that x is disjoint from y does not force x to be disjoint from z; x could lie completely outside z, merely touch z, partially overlap z, or be wholly inside z (in a portion disjoint from y). However, z cannot be part of x (that would imply y ⊂ x, contradicting DC(x,y)), nor can x and z coincide. Hence, the only possible relations between x and z are:  
• DC(x,z),  
• EC(x,z),  
• PO(x,z),  
• TPP(x,z),  
• NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
