PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)) and y and z coincide (EQ(y,z)), then x is necessarily a non-tangential proper part of z. Hence, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:
NTPP(x,z)
