PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x partially overlaps y (PO(x,y)), and y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then y is completely contained in z. Since x and y share some interior and y itself lies entirely within z, x must at least intersect z; however, we do not know whether x extends beyond z or is wholly contained in z. Therefore, x could either partially overlap z or be a proper part of z. Concretely, the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).
