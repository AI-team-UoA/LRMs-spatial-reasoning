PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is disconnected from y, and y is disconnected from z, then there is no constraint forcing a specific relationship between x and z. In fact, all eight RCC-8 relations remain possible between x and z (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z).
