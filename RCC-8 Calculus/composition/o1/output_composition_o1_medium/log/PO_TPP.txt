PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, PO(x,y) means x and y overlap but neither is contained in the other, and TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z that just touches z’s boundary (so y ⊂ z). Because y ⊂ z, any portion of x that overlaps y necessarily overlaps z. However, since x only partially overlaps y and is not contained in y, x may or may not lie entirely within z. Consequently, the possible relations R(x,z) are:

• PO(x,z): x and z overlap but neither contains the other (this can happen if part of x lies outside z).  
• TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary (if x happens to be fully inside z and tangential to z’s boundary).  
• NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and does not touch z’s boundary (if x is fully inside z but away from z’s boundary).  

No other RCC-8 relations are consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
