PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), we know by definition that TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(y,x). In other words, y is a tangential proper part of x (y is wholly inside x and touches x’s boundary). Meanwhile, PO(y,z) says that y and z partially overlap, so y and z share some interior but neither is a subset of the other.

Because y is wholly inside x, the interior overlap of y and z must lie within x. Hence x and z cannot be DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected), because x and z necessarily share that same interior region. Nor can x = z (EQ), because then y and x would also be partially overlapping (contradicting the fact that y is a proper part of x).

Next, x cannot be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP) because then y, being inside x, would also be a part of z—contradicting the requirement that y partially overlaps z (not is contained by z). What remains is that either z also lies (at least partly) inside x or z stretches partly outside x so that x and z share an interior region but neither contains the other. These two situations correspond to:

• z being a proper part of x, either tangentially (TPPi) or non-tangentially (NTPPi), or  
• x and z partially overlapping (PO).  

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
PO, TPPi, NTPPi.
