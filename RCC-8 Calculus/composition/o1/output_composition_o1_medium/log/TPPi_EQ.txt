PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPPi(x,y) holds, then by definition y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(y,x)). Given EQ(y,z), y and z are coincident; hence z is also a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is the only possibility.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
