PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the RCC‐8 semantics, TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and they share (part of) their boundary. Likewise, TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), so z is a proper part of y and shares y’s boundary. Since x < y and y < z (with tangential contact in each case), it follows that x < z. The only outstanding question is whether x also shares z’s boundary or not. Consequently:

• If x does touch z’s boundary, then TPP(x,z).  
• If x does not touch z’s boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC‐8 relation is consistent with both x < y and y < z (each tangential). Therefore, these two are the only possible relations.

### Answer:
TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
