PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then by definition x âŠ† y (x is wholly contained within y). Since y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), they share no boundary or interior points. Consequently, anything contained in y (including x) must also lie completely outside of z; there is no way for x to intersect or touch z if y is entirely disjoint from z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
