PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

According to the standard RCC‑8 composition tables, from PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) all eight RCC‑8 relations between x and z are consistent. In other words, x and z may be DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ. Intuitively, y can “partially overlap” each of x and z in such a way that x and z end up in any of the eight relative configurations (e.g., they can still be disjoint, externally connected, partially overlapping, in a proper-part relationship one way or the other, or even coincident).

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ.
