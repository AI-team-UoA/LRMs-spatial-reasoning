{"prompt": "If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since y and z are coincident (i.e., y and z are the exact same region), any region x that is disconnected from y must also be disconnected from z. Therefore, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is DC(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nDC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 10.102754354476929, "reasoning-tokens": 384, "completion-tokens": 455}
