{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x is fully contained in y and just touches y\u2019s boundary. Since y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), y is fully contained in z\u2019s interior with no boundary contact. Therefore, x (which lies within y and touches y\u2019s boundary) must also lie completely inside z, with no boundary contact with z. This implies x is a non-tangential proper part of z.  \n\n### Answer: NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 26.692347526550293, "reasoning-tokens": 1408, "completion-tokens": 1560}
