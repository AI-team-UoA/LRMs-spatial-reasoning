{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)) and y and z coincide (EQ(y,z)), then x is necessarily a non-tangential proper part of z. Hence, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nNTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 14.386112689971924, "reasoning-tokens": 640, "completion-tokens": 716}
