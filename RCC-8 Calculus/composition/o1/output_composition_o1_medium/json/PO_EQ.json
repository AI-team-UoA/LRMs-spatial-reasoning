{"prompt": "If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Answer:\n\nPO(x,z)\n\nExplanation:\n\nSince y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), they represent exactly the same region. Therefore any relationship that x has to y must hold the same way to z. Given that x partially overlaps y (PO(x,y))\u2014i.e., they share some part but neither is a proper part of the other\u2014the same must be true for x and z. Hence the only possible relationship is PO(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 15.932084321975708, "reasoning-tokens": 768, "completion-tokens": 897}
