{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If TPPi(x,y) holds, then by definition y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(y,x)). Given EQ(y,z), y and z are coincident; hence z is also a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is the only possibility.\n\n### Answer: TPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 24.878714084625244, "reasoning-tokens": 1280, "completion-tokens": 1401}
