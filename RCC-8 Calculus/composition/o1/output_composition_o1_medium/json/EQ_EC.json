{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x and y are equal (EQ(x,y)), they occupy the exact same region. Since y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)), and x and y are the same object, x and z must likewise be externally connected. No other RCC\u20108 relations can apply in this scenario. \n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 11.79966950416565, "reasoning-tokens": 448, "completion-tokens": 527}
