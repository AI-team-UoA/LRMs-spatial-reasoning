{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since y and z share the same spatial region under EQ(y,z), any tangential proper part x of y remains a tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 14.761335849761963, "reasoning-tokens": 640, "completion-tokens": 703}
