{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), then y is effectively the same region as z. Since x and y are externally connected (EC(x,y)), replacing y with the identical region z preserves the external connection. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nEC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 21.97435212135315, "reasoning-tokens": 832, "completion-tokens": 932}
