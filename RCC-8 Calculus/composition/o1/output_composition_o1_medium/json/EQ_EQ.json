{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)) and y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), then x and z must also be coincident. Therefore, the only possible relationship is EQ(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 6.098804473876953, "reasoning-tokens": 256, "completion-tokens": 319}
