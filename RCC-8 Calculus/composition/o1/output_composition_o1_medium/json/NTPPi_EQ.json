{"prompt": "If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If NTPPi(x,y) holds, then by definition y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(y,x)). Hence y is strictly contained in x with no boundary contact. Given EQ(y,z), regions y and z coincide. Substituting z for y preserves the containment and lack of boundary contact. Therefore, z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. In RCC-8 terms, that is precisely NTPPi(x,z).\n\n### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 82.04433870315552, "reasoning-tokens": 3648, "completion-tokens": 3813}
