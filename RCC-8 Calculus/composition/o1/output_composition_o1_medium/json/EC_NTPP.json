{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "From the standard RCC\u20108 composition tables (and by intuitive geometric reasoning) one finds that if x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)) and y is a non\u2010tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then x and z must either partially overlap or else x is also a proper part of z.  Concretely, the possible RCC\u20108 relations between x and z are:\n\n\u2022 PO(x,z) (\u201cpartially overlaps\u201d),  \n\u2022 TPP(x,z) (\u201ctangential proper part\u201d),  \n\u2022 NTPP(x,z) (\u201cnon\u2010tangential proper part\u201d).  \n\nNo other RCC\u20108 relations are consistent with these premises.\n\n### Answer:\nPO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 84.0827522277832, "reasoning-tokens": 4352, "completion-tokens": 4594}
