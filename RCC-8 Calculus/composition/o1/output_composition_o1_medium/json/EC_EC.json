{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is externally connected to y, and y is externally connected to z, then by the usual RCC-8 composition rules (and by constructing suitable geometric examples), x and z can only be:  \n\u2022 DC(x,z) (disconnected),  \n\u2022 EC(x,z) (externally connected), or  \n\u2022 PO(x,z) (partially overlapping).  \n\nNo other RCC-8 relations (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) can arise from EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).  \n\n### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), or PO(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 103.58351278305054, "reasoning-tokens": 4160, "completion-tokens": 4333}
