{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x must also lie fully within z without touching z\u2019s boundary. Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 31.99017834663391, "reasoning-tokens": 1216, "completion-tokens": 1326}
