{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is equal to y (EQ(x,y)) and y partially overlaps z (PO(y,z)), then x must be in exactly the same spatial configuration with z as y is. Hence x also partially overlaps z (PO(x,z)). There are no other possibilities.\n\n### Answer:\nPO(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 16.94790029525757, "reasoning-tokens": 640, "completion-tokens": 712}
