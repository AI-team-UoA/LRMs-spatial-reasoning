{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since x and y coincide, substituting x for y in TPP(y,z) yields TPP(x,z). Hence, the possible relationship(s) are:  \nTPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer: TPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 14.935892820358276, "reasoning-tokens": 704, "completion-tokens": 775}
