{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x and y coincide (EQ(x,y)), then whatever spatial relationship y has to z, x must have the same relationship to z. Since NTPPi(y,z) means that y is the \u201ccontainer\u201d of z (i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y), substituting x for y yields that x is likewise the container of z. In RCC-8 terms, that corresponds uniquely to NTPPi(x,z). \n\n### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 84.98201131820679, "reasoning-tokens": 4608, "completion-tokens": 4767}
