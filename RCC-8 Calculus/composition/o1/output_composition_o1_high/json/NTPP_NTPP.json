{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), x is entirely contained in y with a \u201cbuffer\u201d between their boundaries. Likewise, if y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), y is entirely contained in z with a buffer between y\u2019s boundary and z\u2019s. Because x is wholly inside y, and y is wholly inside z (both with no boundary contact), x must also be strictly inside z without contacting z\u2019s boundary. Hence, x is a non-tangential proper part of z as well:\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 33.5491681098938, "reasoning-tokens": 1664, "completion-tokens": 1837}
