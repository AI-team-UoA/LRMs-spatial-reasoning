{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x = y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nNTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 16.598103761672974, "reasoning-tokens": 768, "completion-tokens": 876}
