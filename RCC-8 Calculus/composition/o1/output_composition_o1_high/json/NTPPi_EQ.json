{"prompt": "If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "From NTPPi(x,y) we know that y is a non\u2010tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(y,x)). Since EQ(y,z) means y and z occupy exactly the same region, z is also a non\u2010tangential proper part of x. In RCC\u20108 notation, that is NTPPi(x,z). \n\n### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 31.710509300231934, "reasoning-tokens": 2304, "completion-tokens": 2448}
