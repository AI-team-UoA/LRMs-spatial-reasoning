{"prompt": "If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If DC(x,y) and y and z coincide (EQ(y,z)), then the only consistent relation is DC(x,z). Since y and z are the same region, and x does not share any parts with y, it follows that x does not share any parts with z either.\n\n### Answer:\nDC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 12.755120754241943, "reasoning-tokens": 320, "completion-tokens": 419}
