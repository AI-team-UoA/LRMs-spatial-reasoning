{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since x and y coincide (EQ(x,y)), they are indistinguishable in terms of spatial location. Therefore, if y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), x must also be disconnected from z. \n\n### Answer: DC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 8.215167760848999, "reasoning-tokens": 448, "completion-tokens": 509}
