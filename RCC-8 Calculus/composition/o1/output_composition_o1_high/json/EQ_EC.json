{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is coincident with y, then any relationship y has with another region z must also hold for x and z. Hence, if EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), the only possibility for x and z is EC(x,z). \n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 17.612513780593872, "reasoning-tokens": 640, "completion-tokens": 708}
