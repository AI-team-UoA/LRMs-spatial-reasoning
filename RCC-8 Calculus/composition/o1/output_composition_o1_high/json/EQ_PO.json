{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x = y (i.e., EQ(x,y)) and y partially overlaps z (i.e., PO(y,z)), then x is the same region as y and so it must also partially overlap z. Thus, the only possible relation is PO(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nPO", "elapsed-time": 16.485405683517456, "reasoning-tokens": 832, "completion-tokens": 922}
