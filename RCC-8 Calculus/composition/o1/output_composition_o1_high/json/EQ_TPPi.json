{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is identical to y (i.e., EQ(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z in the inverse sense (i.e., TPPi(y,z)), then from y = x it follows that TPPi(x,z) must hold. In RCC-8 terms:\n\n\u2022 TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y) (z is a tangential proper part of y).  \n\u2022 Since x = y, TPP(z,y) implies TPP(z,x).  \n\u2022 From x\u2019s perspective, that is TPPi(x,z).\n\nNo other RCC-8 relations are consistent with these premises, so the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi.\n\n### Answer: TPPi.", "elapsed-time": 43.84782814979553, "reasoning-tokens": 2880, "completion-tokens": 3092}
