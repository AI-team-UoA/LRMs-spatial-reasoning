{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "From NTPP(x,y), x lies strictly in the interior of y with no shared boundary; from TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z but touches z\u2019s boundary. Since x is \u201cinside\u201d y and y\u2019s boundary alone meets z\u2019s boundary, x cannot also meet z\u2019s boundary. Hence x must be strictly contained in z with no boundary contact. Therefore:\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 67.07230401039124, "reasoning-tokens": 3264, "completion-tokens": 3397}
