{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then because x and y coincide (are the same region), x inherits y\u2019s tangential proper part relationship to z. Consequently, the only possible binary RCC-8 relation between x and z is TPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer: TPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 17.179347038269043, "reasoning-tokens": 960, "completion-tokens": 1066}
