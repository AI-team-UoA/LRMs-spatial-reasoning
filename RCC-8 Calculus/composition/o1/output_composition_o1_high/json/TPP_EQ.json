{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then because y and z coincide (are the same region), x remains a tangential proper part of z. In other words, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 21.708330631256104, "reasoning-tokens": 960, "completion-tokens": 1048}
