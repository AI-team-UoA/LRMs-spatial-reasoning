{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)) and y is externally connected to z (EC(y,z)), then x could \u201ctouch\u201d y\u2019s boundary in a place that does not coincide with the y\u2013z boundary (disconnected from z), or in a place that does coincide with the y\u2013z boundary (externally connected with z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible under these constraints. Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) or EC(x,z).\n\n### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 29.855257987976074, "reasoning-tokens": 1536, "completion-tokens": 1693}
