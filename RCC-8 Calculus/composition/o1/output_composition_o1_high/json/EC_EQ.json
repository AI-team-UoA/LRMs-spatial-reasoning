{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), then any relationship x has to y applies identically to z. Because x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), meaning x and y share only a boundary but no interior, the same must be true of x and z. Hence, the only possible relation is EC(x,z).\n\n### Answer:\nEC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 22.214688062667847, "reasoning-tokens": 1088, "completion-tokens": 1196}
