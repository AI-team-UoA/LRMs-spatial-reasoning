{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given TPPi(x,y), we know by definition that TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). In other words, y is a tangential proper part of x (y \u2282 x and their boundaries touch). If EQ(y,z), then y and z are the same region. Consequently, z is also a tangential proper part of x. Hence, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z). No other RCC-8 relation can hold in this scenario.\n\n### Answer: TPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 46.617483139038086, "reasoning-tokens": 2432, "completion-tokens": 2590}
