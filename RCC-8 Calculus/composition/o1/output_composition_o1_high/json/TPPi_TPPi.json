{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y. By transitivity of parthood, z is necessarily a proper part of x; however, z may or may not touch the boundary of x. Hence the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 35.431519508361816, "reasoning-tokens": 1792, "completion-tokens": 1953}
