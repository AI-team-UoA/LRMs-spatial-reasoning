{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x must also lie fully inside z without touching z\u2019s boundary. Hence x is a non-tangential proper part of z. No other RCC-8 relation is possible.\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 69.32496547698975, "reasoning-tokens": 3328, "completion-tokens": 3442}
