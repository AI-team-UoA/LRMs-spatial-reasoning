PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is wholly inside x with no boundary contact). Likewise, NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non‐tangential proper part of y. Because z is wholly inside y, and y is wholly inside x (both with a gap to the boundary), it follows transitively that z must also be wholly inside x with no boundary contact. In RCC‐8 terms, that precisely corresponds to NTPPi(x,z). No other RCC‐8 relation can arise under these conditions.

### Answer:
NTPPi(x,z)
