PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is disconnected from y (i.e., DC(x,y)) and y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then y lies strictly inside z (with no boundary contact) but shares no points with x. This does not fix how x sits relative to z; x may lie entirely outside z, partially overlap an “external” region of z that does not include y, or lie disjointly inside z alongside y. Consequently, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:

• DC(x,z)  
• EC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPP(x,z)  
• NTPP(x,z)  

No other relations are possible because, for instance, if z were a (proper) part of x (TPPi or NTPPi), it would force y (contained in z) also to be contained in x, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
