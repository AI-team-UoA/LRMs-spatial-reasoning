PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) (x and y partially overlap but neither is contained in the other) and NTPP(y,z) (y is a proper part of z, wholly in its interior), y lies completely inside z but x merely overlaps y. Such an overlap does not force x to lie entirely inside or partly outside z; both are possible. Consequently, x can be:  
• Strictly inside z (so x is a proper part of z). This proper part could be either tangential (TPP) or non-tangential (NTPP), depending on whether x touches z’s boundary.  
• Partly outside z (so x and z still share an interior intersection, but neither is contained in the other), which is PO(x,z).  

Therefore, the only consistent RCC-8 relations between x and z are:  
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP.
