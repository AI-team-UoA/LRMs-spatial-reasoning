PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the RCC‐8 definitions, NTPP(x,y) tells us that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y’s boundary (i.e., x is wholly in the interior of y). TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which says that z is a proper part of y but does touch y’s boundary. Thus, both x and z are strictly contained in y, but x lies entirely in y’s interior, while z meets y’s boundary.

Because x and z are both contained in y, yet one touches y’s boundary (z) and the other does not (x), there is no immediate topological restriction forcing x and z either to be disjoint, to overlap, or for one to be inside the other. The only clear impossibilities arise from the fact that z cannot itself lie inside x (since then z could not reach y’s boundary), and x cannot equal z (they differ in whether they meet y’s boundary). Consequently, the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z in this scenario are:

1) DC(x,z)  – x and z are disjoint.  
2) EC(x,z)  – x and z are externally connected (they share a boundary but no interior).  
3) PO(x,z)  – x and z partially overlap (they share some interior region).  
4) TPP(x,z) – x is a tangential proper part of z (x ⊂ z and their boundaries meet).  
5) NTPP(x,z) – x is a non‐tangential proper part of z (x ⊂ z and their boundaries do not meet).  

No other RCC‐8 relation can hold under the given constraints.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
