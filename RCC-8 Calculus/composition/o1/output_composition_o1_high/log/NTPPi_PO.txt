PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) holds, then by definition y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is strictly inside x with no boundary contact). Meanwhile, PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior but neither contains the other. From this, one can show:

• x and z cannot be DC or EC, because y ∩ z is a nonempty interior region lying wholly within x, so x and z do share interior points.  
• x and z cannot be EQ, as that would force y to be a proper part of z but also contradict PO(y,z).  
• x cannot be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP with x inside z), because then y would also lie strictly inside z, contradicting the PO(y,z) requirement that y is not contained in z.  

Hence, the remaining possibilities are:  
1) PO(x,z) if z only partially lies in x (so that they share interior but neither contains the other),  
2) TPPi(x,z) if z is a tangential proper part of x,  
3) NTPPi(x,z) if z is a non‐tangential proper part of x.  

Thus the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
