PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the RCC‐8 definitions, “NTPPi(x,y)” says that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is wholly inside x with no shared boundary), while “TPP(y,z)” says that y is a tangential proper part of z (y lies in z but does share part of z’s boundary).  The question is what this can force (or allow) about the relation between x and z.

• First, x and z cannot be DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected), because y lies in both x and z, so x and z must share interior points (namely those of y).  
• Nor can x equal z, because then y would also be tangential to x (contradicting the fact that y is wholly in x with no boundary contact from x’s perspective).  
• One finds by constructing (or ruling out) examples that x cannot be properly inside z (that is, x < z); if x were wholly inside z, then any boundary contact that y has with z would necessarily force y’s boundary also to contact x’s boundary—contradicting that y is strictly inside x with no common boundary.  

That leaves three viable cases for the relation between x and z:

1) PO(x,z):  x and z partially overlap.  
2) TPPi(x,z):  from z’s point of view, z is a tangential proper part of x (so z < x with boundary contact).  
3) NTPPi(x,z):  from z’s point of view, z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (so z < x with no boundary contact).  

All three can be realized by suitable examples in the plane (or in any topological space), and no other cases survive the requirement that y be strictly inside x yet tangentially inside z.  

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
