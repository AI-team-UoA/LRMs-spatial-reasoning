PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

A useful way to see why multiple relations are possible is to imagine y as a region “inside” z but just touching z’s boundary (because TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z whose boundary also meets z’s boundary), and x as a region “touching” y but not intersecting y’s interior (because EC(x,y) means x and y share boundary points but have no interior overlap).  Depending on how x is placed relative to z, one can construct examples where:

• x sits entirely outside z but touches y only at the portion of y that meets z’s boundary (yielding EC(x,z)).  
• x straddles z’s boundary, so its interior partially overlaps z’s interior (yielding PO(x,z)).  
• x lies fully inside z and also touches z’s boundary (yielding TPP(x,z)).  
• x lies fully inside z but does not reach z’s boundary (yielding NTPP(x,z)).  

No other RCC-8 relations turn out to be consistent with EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).  

### Answer: EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.
