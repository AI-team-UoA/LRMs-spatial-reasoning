PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)) and y partially overlaps z (PO(y,z)), then x can lie entirely outside the region of y∩z, lie entirely within y∩z, or straddle its boundary.  Consequently, x can be  
• completely outside and disjoint from z (DC),  
• just touch z at a boundary (EC),  
• partially overlap z (PO), or  
• lie entirely inside z, either touching z’s boundary (TPP) or not touching it (NTPP).  

No other RCC‐8 relations arise consistently from TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).  

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
