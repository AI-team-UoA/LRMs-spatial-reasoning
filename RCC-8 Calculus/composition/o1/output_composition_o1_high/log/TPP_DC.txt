PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is tangentially inside y (TPP(x,y)), then every point of x is contained within y (including x’s boundary lying on y’s boundary). Since y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), there is no point (interior or boundary) that y and z share. Consequently, x—being wholly contained in y—also cannot share any point with z. The only consistent RCC‑8 relation between x and z under these conditions is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
