PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x must also lie fully inside z without touching zâ€™s boundary. Hence x is a non-tangential proper part of z. No other RCC-8 relation is possible.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
