PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x partially overlaps y (PO(x,y)), then x neither contains y nor is contained in y. Meanwhile, TPPi(y,z) is by definition TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is wholly inside y but shares y’s boundary). Because x only partly overlaps y, there is no restriction forcing x to intersect or contain z, nor is there a restriction preventing it. Consequently, the following relationships between x and z are all consistent with PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):

• DC(x,z): x and z can be completely disjoint if x’s portion inside y does not overlap z at all.  
• EC(x,z): x and z can touch at a boundary inside y but have no interior overlap.  
• PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap within y.  
• TPPi(x,z): Equivalently TPP(z,x), so z can be a tangential proper part of x (if x happens to include the region of z in its interior, sharing a boundary).  
• NTPPi(x,z): Equivalently NTPP(z,x), so z can also be a non-tangential proper part of x (if z lies strictly in the interior of x with no boundary contact).  

No other relations (such as TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or EQ(x,z)) are possible under these conditions, because that would require x to lie wholly within z or to coincide with z—both impossible, given x partially overlaps y but lies partly outside it, while z is wholly within y.
