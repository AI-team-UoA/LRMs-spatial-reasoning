PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then by the definition of EQ, y and z refer to exactly the same region (they are coincident). Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e., x is strictly inside y and does not touch yâ€™s boundary), it follows that x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. Consequently, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
