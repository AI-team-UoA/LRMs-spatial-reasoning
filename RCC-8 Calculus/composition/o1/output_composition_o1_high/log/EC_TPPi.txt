PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), then x and y share only a boundary (but no interior points). Meanwhile, TPPi(y,z) implies that y is the larger region and z is tangent‐proper‐part of y (i.e., z lies strictly within y but touches y’s boundary). Since x lies outside y (touching it from the outside) and z lies inside y (touching it from the inside), x and z cannot share any interior points. They may either meet at the same boundary portion on y (in which case x and z would also be externally connected) or else meet at disjoint boundary portions (so that x and z do not meet at all). Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) or EC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)
