PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then because x and y coincide (are the same region), x inherits yâ€™s tangential proper part relationship to z. Consequently, the only possible binary RCC-8 relation between x and z is TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
