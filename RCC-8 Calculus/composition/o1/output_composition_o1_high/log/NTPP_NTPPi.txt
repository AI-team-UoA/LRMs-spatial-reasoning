PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the RCC‐8 definitions, NTPP(x,y) means “x is a non‐tangential proper part of y” (x is strictly inside y with no shared boundary), and NTPPi(y,z) is by definition NTPP(z,y), meaning “z is a non‐tangential proper part of y.” Thus both x and z lie strictly inside y (without touching y’s boundary). However, knowing only that x and z are both strictly inside y does not constrain how x and z themselves may intersect (or fail to intersect). In particular, they can be disjoint, just touch each other’s boundaries internally, partially overlap, one can be inside the other (tangentially or non‐tangentially), or they can coincide. Consequently, all eight RCC‐8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z).
