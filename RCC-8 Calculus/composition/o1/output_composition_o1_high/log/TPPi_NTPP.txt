PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the RCC‐8 definitions, TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y < x and their boundaries coincide in some places), while NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non‐tangential proper part of z (y < z with no boundary contact).  In particular:

• TPPi(x,y) ⇒ y < x with boundary contact between y and x.  
• NTPP(y,z) ⇒ y < z with y’s boundary strictly in the interior of z.  

Because y is contained in both x and z, x and z must at least share y as part of their intersection.  One can then rule out DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) (since x and z must share interior points) and also show that having z < x would block y from ever reaching x’s boundary.  Likewise x = z contradicts y’s tangential vs. non‐tangential status.  

What remains possible are:  
1) PO(x,z) (x and z partially overlap).  
2) TPP(x,z) (x < z with boundary contact).  
3) NTPP(x,z) (x < z with no boundary contact).  

Hence the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
