PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If one consults the standard RCC‐8 composition tables (or carries out a case‐by‐case topological analysis), one finds that from

• PO(x,y)  (x and y partially overlap), and  
• EC(y,z)  (y and z share a boundary but have no interior intersection),

the possible relations between x and z are exactly:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Intuitively:

• DC is possible if x’s overlap with y stays “away” from y’s boundary with z.  
• EC is possible if x extends to that same boundary but does not enter z’s interior.  
• PO is possible if x continues through y’s boundary into z, creating a nonempty interior intersection with z.  
• TPPi(x,z) (i.e. z is a tangential proper part of x) is possible if z lies entirely within x, touching x’s boundary (and still only “touching” y on its boundary).  
• NTPPi(x,z) (i.e. z is a non‐tangential proper part of x) is possible if z lies entirely in the interior of x (again meeting y only on z’s boundary).

By contrast, relations in which x is a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP) would force y and z to share an interior (contradicting EC), and EQ(x,z) contradicts x PO y.  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
