PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ. 

Because x and y are disjoint (DC) and y and z are disjoint (DC), there is no topological constraint forcing any particular relation between x and z. Consequently, all eight RCC-8 relations remain possible.
