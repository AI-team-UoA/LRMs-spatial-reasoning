PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x properly tangentially includes y (TPPi(x,y)) then y is wholly inside x, sharing part of x’s boundary.  Since y partially overlaps z (PO(y,z))—they share some interior but neither is contained in the other—z must at least intersect the interior of x (through y).  However, z might lie entirely inside x or might extend beyond x.  As a result:

• x and z cannot be DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected), because y∩z is a nonempty interior region lying inside x.  
• x cannot be a proper part of z (whether tangential or non-tangential), because that would force y to be contained in z, contradicting PO(y,z).  
• x cannot be equal to z (EQ), for the same reason (y would then be contained in z).  

Thus, the only possibilities are:  
• PO(x,z), if z extends outside x but still intersects x’s interior (via y),  
• TPPi(x,z), if z is wholly inside x and touches x’s boundary,  
• NTPPi(x,z), if z is wholly inside x with no boundary contact.  

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
