PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is the “larger” region in NTPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x (entirely inside, not touching x’s boundary). At the same time, DC(y,z) states that y and z are disjoint. For x and z, any relation forcing x to lie entirely inside z (e.g., NTPP(x,z), TPP(x,z), or EQ(x,z)) would also force y inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). Conversely, x may be disjoint from z, merely touch z, partially overlap z, or contain z (disjointly from y) without contradiction. Hence the possible relations between x and z are:

• DC(x,z)  
• EC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPPi(x,z)  
• NTPPi(x,z)  

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
