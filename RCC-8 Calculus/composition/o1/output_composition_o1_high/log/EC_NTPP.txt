PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If X is externally connected to Y (EC(x,y)) and Y is a non‐tangential proper part of Z (NTPP(y,z)), then the possible RCC‐8 relations between X and Z are exactly EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.  In brief:

• DC(x,z) is impossible because the boundary point shared by X and Y lies strictly in the interior of Z (since Y ⊂ Z with a “buffer” around Y), so X and Z cannot be completely disconnected.  
• EQ(x,z) is ruled out because Y is strictly contained in Z but only externally touches X, so X and Z cannot coincide.  
• The “inverse‐part” cases (TPPi, NTPPi) would require Z to be contained in X, which again contradicts X and Y being only externally connected while Y lies inside Z.  

By contrast, one can construct (in standard Euclidean space) examples where X is wholly inside Z (giving TPP or NTPP), or partly outside Z (giving PO), or just tangentially meets Z (giving EC).  

Thus the possible relations are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
