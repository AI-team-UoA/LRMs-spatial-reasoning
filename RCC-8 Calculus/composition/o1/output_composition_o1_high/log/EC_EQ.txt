PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), then any relationship x has to y applies identically to z. Because x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), meaning x and y share only a boundary but no interior, the same must be true of x and z. Hence, the only possible relation is EC(x,z).

### Answer:
EC(x,z)
