PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is coincident with y, then any relationship y has with another region z must also hold for x and z. Hence, if EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), the only possibility for x and z is EC(x,z). 

### Answer: EC(x,z)
