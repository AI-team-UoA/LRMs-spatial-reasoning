PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y and z coincide (EQ(y,z)), then from x’s perspective, y and z are essentially the same region. Since x partially overlaps y (PO(x,y))—that is, they share interior points but neither is part of the other—x must also partially overlap z. Therefore, the only possible relationship is PO(x,z).

### Answer:
PO(x,z)
