PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From NTPP(x,y), x lies strictly in the interior of y with no shared boundary; from TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z but touches z’s boundary. Since x is “inside” y and y’s boundary alone meets z’s boundary, x cannot also meet z’s boundary. Hence x must be strictly contained in z with no boundary contact. Therefore:

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
