PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x partially overlaps y, while y is disconnected from z, then the portion of x that overlaps y cannot be in z (since y and z share no points). However, there is no restriction on how any parts of x outside y relate to z. Consequently, x could either miss z entirely, touch z at a boundary, partially overlap z, or even contain z (as long as x is not contained in z). In RCC-8 terms:

• DC(x,z) is possible (x and z can be disjoint).  
• EC(x,z) is possible (they can touch at a boundary only).  
• PO(x,z) is possible (they can partially overlap).  
• TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible (because x cannot be wholly inside z; part of x is in y, which is disjoint from z).  
• TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible (z can be wholly inside x).  
• EQ(x,z) is not possible (x cannot equal z because x partially overlaps y, whereas y and z are disjoint).  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, or NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).
