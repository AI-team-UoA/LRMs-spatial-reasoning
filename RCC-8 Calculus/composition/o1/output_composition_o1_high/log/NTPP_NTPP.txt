PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), x is entirely contained in y with a “buffer” between their boundaries. Likewise, if y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), y is entirely contained in z with a buffer between y’s boundary and z’s. Because x is wholly inside y, and y is wholly inside z (both with no boundary contact), x must also be strictly inside z without contacting z’s boundary. Hence, x is a non-tangential proper part of z as well:

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
