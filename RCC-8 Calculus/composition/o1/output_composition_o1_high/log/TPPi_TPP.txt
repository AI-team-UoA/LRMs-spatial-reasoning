PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Answering this requires noting that TPPi(x,y) is by definition the same as TPP(y,x), i.e., “y is a tangential proper part of x,” and TPP(y,z) means “y is a tangential proper part of z.”  In set‐like terms, y is strictly included in x (touching x’s boundary) and also strictly included in z (touching z’s boundary).  From this alone, one cannot deduce a strict subset or superset relation between x and z; all that is guaranteed is that x and z share at least the interior points of y.  

Hence x and z cannot be Disconnected (DC) or merely Externally Connected (EC), since they do share interior points (namely those in y).  Beyond that, however, x and z could be equal (EQ), one could be (tangentially or non‐tangentially) inside the other (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi), or they could partially overlap (PO).  Concretely:

• DC(x,z) is impossible (they share y).  
• EC(x,z) is impossible (they share interior points).  
• Any of PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ between x and z can be realized by suitable examples.

Therefore, the possible RCC‑8 relations between x and z are:  
PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.
