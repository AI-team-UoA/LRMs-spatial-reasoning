PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y partially overlap (PO(x,y)) and y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), then there is a consistent geometric configuration realizing every one of the eight RCC-8 relations between x and z. In other words, x and z can be DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ. 

For example, one can arrange x, y, and z so that x and z do not intersect at all (making DC(x,z) true), or so that x and z only share a boundary (EC), or indeed so that x is wholly within z (TPP or NTPP), etc. None of these possibilities are ruled out merely by having PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). 

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.
