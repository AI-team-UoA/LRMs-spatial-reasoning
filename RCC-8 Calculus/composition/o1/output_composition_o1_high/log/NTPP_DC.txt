PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)) and y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), then x, being wholly contained in y, cannot intersect or even touch z. The only possible relationship is therefore that x is disconnected from z:

### Answer: DC(x,z)
