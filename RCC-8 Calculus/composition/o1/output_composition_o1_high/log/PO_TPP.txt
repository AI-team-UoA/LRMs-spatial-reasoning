PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x partially overlaps y (PO(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then x and z must at least share the interior region that x shares with y (since y ⊆ z).  Beyond that, x might lie entirely within z or might extend outside z.  Consequently, one can show that the only consistent possibilities for the relation between x and z are:

• PO(x,z) if part of x lies outside z (so neither x ⊆ z nor z ⊆ x),  
• TPP(x,z) if x is entirely within z and x’s boundary touches z’s boundary,  
• NTPP(x,z) if x is entirely within z but does not touch z’s boundary.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible under these assumptions.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
