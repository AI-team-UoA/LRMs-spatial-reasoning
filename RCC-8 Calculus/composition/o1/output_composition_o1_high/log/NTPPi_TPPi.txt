PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we translate these into their “forward” forms:

• NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x). This says “y is a non‐tangential proper part of x,” i.e. y is wholly inside x and does not touch x’s boundary.  
• TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y). This says “z is a tangential proper part of y,” i.e. z is wholly inside y but does touch y’s boundary.

Since y is wholly inside x with some positive “gap” from x’s boundary (because it is non‐tangential), any region z that sits inside y—even if it touches y’s boundary—will still lie entirely in the interior of x (with no contact to x’s boundary). Hence z is also a non‐tangential proper part of x. In RCC‐8 form, that is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently NTPPi(x,z). No other RCC‐8 relation is consistent with these premises.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
