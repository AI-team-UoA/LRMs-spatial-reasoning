PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If y and x are disconnected (DC(x,y)), then x cannot intersect any part of y, whether in its interior or on its boundary. Meanwhile, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), i.e. z is a tangential proper part of y and therefore lies entirely within y (apart from a boundary touch). Since z is wholly contained in y, any intersection x might have with z would necessarily intersect y as well. That would contradict DC(x,y). Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is also DC.

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
