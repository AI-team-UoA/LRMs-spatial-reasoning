PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), we know by definition that TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). In other words, y is a tangential proper part of x (y âŠ‚ x and their boundaries touch). If EQ(y,z), then y and z are the same region. Consequently, z is also a tangential proper part of x. Hence, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z). No other RCC-8 relation can hold in this scenario.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
