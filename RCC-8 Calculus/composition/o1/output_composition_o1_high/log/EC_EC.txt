PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

A concise way to see why only DC, EC, or PO can arise is via the standard “composition‐table” constraint used in RCC‑8.  In RCC‑8, saying x EC y and y EC z (i.e., x and y only meet at a boundary, and y and z only meet at a boundary) forces x and z either to be completely disjoint, to touch at a boundary, or to overlap in their interiors.  In other words:

• DC(x,z) (disconnected) can happen if x and z lie on “opposite sides” of y, so that x and z share neither boundary nor interior.  
• EC(x,z) (externally connected) can happen if one arranges x, y, z so that x and z also abut at a boundary (without sharing interior).  
• PO(x,z) (partial overlap) can happen if x “wraps around” to meet z in such a way that their interiors do intersect, yet each remains only boundary‐connected to y.

No proper‐part or equality relations (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) can emerge solely from x EC y and y EC z under the usual RCC‑8 semantics, because “externally connected” rules out the subset or coincident‐region cases.  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), or PO(x,z).
