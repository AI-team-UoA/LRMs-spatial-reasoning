PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From EC(x,y) we know that x and y meet only at a boundary (with no shared interior). From NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y) we know that z is wholly in the interior of y (not even sharing y’s boundary). Consequently, z’s region is completely “inside” y, whereas x lies “outside” y apart from their shared boundary. Hence x cannot intersect z in any way (neither boundary nor interior), making DC(x,z) the only possible relation.
