PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then x is necessarily a proper part of z (since x ⊂ y and y ⊂ z). Whether x actually touches z’s boundary depends on the specific geometry: x may or may not also be tangent to z. Hence, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:
TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
