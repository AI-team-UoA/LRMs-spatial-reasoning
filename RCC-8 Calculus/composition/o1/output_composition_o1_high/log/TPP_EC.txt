PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)) and y is externally connected to z (EC(y,z)), then x could “touch” y’s boundary in a place that does not coincide with the y–z boundary (disconnected from z), or in a place that does coincide with the y–z boundary (externally connected with z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible under these constraints. Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) or EC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
