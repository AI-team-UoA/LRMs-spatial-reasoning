PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

A concise way to see why these four relations arise is to note that:

• TPP(x,y) says x is a proper part of y and does touch y’s boundary.  
• NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), so z is a proper part of y that does not touch y’s boundary.

Hence both x and z sit “inside” y, but x’s boundary meets y’s boundary while z’s does not.  Topologically this leaves the following consistent ways x and z can relate:

1) They may lie wholly apart from one another inside y (DC).  
2) They may touch only at a boundary in y’s interior (EC).  
3) They may partially overlap in y’s interior (PO).  
4) Or z may lie completely inside x (provided x “wraps around” enough), in which case z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)).  

No other RCC‐8 relations are possible under those two constraints.  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
