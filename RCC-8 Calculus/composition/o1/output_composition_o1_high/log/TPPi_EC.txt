PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the RCC‐8 definitions, “TPPi(x,y)” means that y is a “tangential proper part” of x (i.e., y ⊂ x with boundary‐contact), and “EC(y,z)” means y and z share only a boundary (no interior overlap).  Because y is a subset of x, any point of y (including boundary points) is also in x.  Hence the boundary‐point(s) that y shares with z also lie in x, so x and z cannot be completely disjoint (DC), nor can they coincide (EQ).  In fact, all of the remaining six RCC‐8 relations turn out to be compatible with those premises.  Concretely:

• They can share only a boundary (EC).  
• They can partially overlap in their interiors (PO).  
• One may be a (tangential or non‐tangential) proper part of the other (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi).  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi.

### Answer:
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
