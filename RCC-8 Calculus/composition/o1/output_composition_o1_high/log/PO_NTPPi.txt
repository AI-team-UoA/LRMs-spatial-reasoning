PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y partially overlap (PO(x,y)), neither contains the other; and if y properly contains z in its interior (NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non‐tangential proper part of y), then z is wholly inside y with no boundary contact.  From these facts alone, the region z may or may not lie in the portion of y that x overlaps.  Consequently, the following RCC‐8 relations between x and z are all consistent with those premises:

• DC(x,z): They may be completely disjoint if z happens to lie in a part of y that x does not intersect.  
• EC(x,z): They may only touch at a boundary (externally connected) if x intersects the boundary of z without overlapping z’s interior.  
• PO(x,z): They may partially overlap if x’s overlap with y includes interior points of z, but x does not fully contain z, and z does not fully contain x.  
• TPPi(x,z): z may be a tangential proper part of x (i.e., z ⊂ x with boundary contact) if z lies entirely within the portion of x that is inside y and meets x at a boundary.  
• NTPPi(x,z): z may be a non‐tangential proper part of x (z ⊂ x with no boundary contact) if z is wholly in the interior of x as well as the interior of y.

Neither TPP(x,z) nor NTPP(x,z) is possible because that would require x to be wholly inside z (contradicting PO(x,y)), and EQ(x,z) is impossible because z is strictly contained in y whereas x is only partially in y.  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
