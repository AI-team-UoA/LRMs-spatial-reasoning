PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the standard RCC-8 composition table (or by direct geometric reasoning), if DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
