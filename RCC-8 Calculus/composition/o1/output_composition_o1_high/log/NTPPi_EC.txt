PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If one unpacks “NTPPi(x,y)” as “y is (strictly) part of x (no boundary contact)” and “EC(y,z)” as “y and z share only a boundary (no interior overlap),” then from the usual topological‐set interpretation of RCC‑8 one can show:

• x and z cannot be DC, because the boundary of y (which lies entirely inside x) is also a boundary point of z. Hence x and z share at least those boundary points.  
• They likewise cannot be EC, because from x’s perspective that common boundary is in x’s interior (not x’s boundary). Nor can x be part of z (TPP or NTPP) or equal to z (EQ), etc.

What remains consistent are exactly the following three possibilities.  Either z is wholly inside x (possibly touching x’s boundary or not) or z extends outside x in such a way that they share a genuine interior intersection.  In RCC‑8 terms, these correspond to:

1) PO(x,z) – x and z partially overlap (if z “intrudes” into x so that they share a region of interior points).  
2) TPPi(x,z) – z is a tangential proper part of x (z is wholly in x but touches x’s boundary).  
3) NTPPi(x,z) – z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (z is wholly in x with no boundary contact to x).

Hence the possible relations between x and z are PO, TPPi, or NTPPi.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
