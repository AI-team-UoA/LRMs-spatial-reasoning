PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non‐tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)) and y partially overlaps z (PO(y,z)), then x can lie entirely in the part of y that does not intersect z, or entirely/partially in the part of y that does intersect z.  From an RCC‐8 standpoint, this allows for all of the following possibilities between x and z:

• DC(x,z) – x and z are disconnected (if x lies in the portion of y that does not meet z at all).  
• EC(x,z) – x is externally connected to z (if the boundaries of x and z meet inside y but their interiors do not intersect).  
• PO(x,z) – x partially overlaps z (if x’s interior intersects z’s interior, yet neither is contained in the other).  
• TPP(x,z) – x is a tangential proper part of z (if x is wholly contained in z but touches z’s boundary).  
• NTPP(x,z) – x is a non‐tangential proper part of z (if x is wholly contained in z and does not touch z’s boundary).

Thus, the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:  
DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).
