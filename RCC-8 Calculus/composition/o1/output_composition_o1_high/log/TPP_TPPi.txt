PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the RCC‐8 viewpoint, saying TPP(x,y) places x strictly inside y (with boundary contact), and TPPi(y,z) (which is TPP(z,y)) places z strictly inside y (also with boundary contact).  In other words, x < y and z < y, but there is no direct ordering implied between x and z.  Consequently, x and z can be arranged inside y in any topologically consistent way: they may be disjoint, externally touching, partially overlapping, one contained in the other (tangentially or otherwise), or even coincide.  Hence all eight RCC‐8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
