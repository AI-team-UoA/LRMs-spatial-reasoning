PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If DC(x,y) and y and z coincide (EQ(y,z)), then the only consistent relation is DC(x,z). Since y and z are the same region, and x does not share any parts with y, it follows that x does not share any parts with z either.

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
