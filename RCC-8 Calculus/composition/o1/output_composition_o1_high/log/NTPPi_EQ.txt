PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From NTPPi(x,y) we know that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(y,x)). Since EQ(y,z) means y and z occupy exactly the same region, z is also a non‐tangential proper part of x. In RCC‐8 notation, that is NTPPi(x,z). 

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
