PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then because y and z coincide (are the same region), x remains a tangential proper part of z. In other words, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).

### Answer:
TPP(x,z)
