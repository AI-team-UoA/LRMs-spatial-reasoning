PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x and y are externally connected (EC(x,y)), then x and y share a boundary but have no interior overlap. If y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), then y and z share no points at all (neither boundary nor interior). Under these circumstances, one can show that x could still be unrelated to z in several different ways, so long as those ways do not force y and z to share a point.

In particular, the only relations ruled out are the ones that would imply x is wholly contained in z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z))—since that would force any boundary point of x (which is also on y) to lie in z, contradicting DC(y,z)—and the coincidence EQ(x,z). All the other relations remain possible.

Hence, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:  
• DC(x,z)  
• EC(x,z)  
• PO(x,z)  
• TPPi(x,z)  (meaning z is a tangential proper part of x)  
• NTPPi(x,z) (meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x)  

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
