PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y), x and y share no points (neither boundary nor interior). Meanwhile, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z lies wholly inside y, without even touching y’s boundary). Because z ⊂ y and x shares no points with y, x cannot share any points with z either (or else x and y would share those same points). Hence x and z must also be disconnected. Therefore, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is:

DC(x,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
