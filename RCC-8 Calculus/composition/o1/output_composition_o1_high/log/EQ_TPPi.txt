PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is identical to y (i.e., EQ(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z in the inverse sense (i.e., TPPi(y,z)), then from y = x it follows that TPPi(x,z) must hold. In RCC-8 terms:

• TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y) (z is a tangential proper part of y).  
• Since x = y, TPP(z,y) implies TPP(z,x).  
• From x’s perspective, that is TPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are consistent with these premises, so the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi.

### Answer: TPPi.
