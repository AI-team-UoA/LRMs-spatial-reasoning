PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the standard RCC-8 composition table (or by direct geometric reasoning), DC(x,y) âˆ§ EC(y,z) implies that the possible relations between x and z are exactly DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.  In particular, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are ruled out because they would force x and y to intersect when y touches z. 

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.
