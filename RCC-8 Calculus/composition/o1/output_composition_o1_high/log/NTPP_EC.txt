PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), then x lies strictly in y’s interior and does not touch y’s boundary. Since y is externally connected to z (EC(y,z)), y and z share boundary points only (no interior overlap). Because x does not reach y’s boundary, it cannot intersect or touch z. Therefore, the only possible relation is that x is disconnected from z, i.e., DC(x,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z)
