PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then x cannot contain z (and thus cannot contain y), so relations such as TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z) are ruled out. However, x might lie outside z, just touch z externally, partially overlap z, or be a (tangential or non-tangential) proper part of z in a way that does not intersect y at all. Consequently, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
