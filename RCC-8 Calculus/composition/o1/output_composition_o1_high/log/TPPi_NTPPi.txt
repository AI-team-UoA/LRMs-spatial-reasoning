PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “TPPi(x,y)” means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., x is the larger region, and y touches x’s boundary), and “NTPPi(y,z)” means that z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (y is larger, and z does not touch y’s boundary).  Chaining these:

• TPPi(x,y) ⇒ y is wholly contained in x, with y’s boundary touching x’s boundary.  
• NTPPi(y,z) ⇒ z is wholly contained in y, with no boundary contact between z and y.

Because z sits strictly inside y (no boundary contact), and y itself only touches x at x’s boundary, z cannot “reach” x’s boundary.  Consequently, z is also wholly contained in x (making it a proper part of x) but does not touch x’s boundary.  In RCC‑8 terms, that is exactly the non‐tangential‐proper‐part relation.  Written with x first and z second, this is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
NTPPi(x,z)
