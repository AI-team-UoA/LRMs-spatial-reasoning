PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

From the standard RCC–8 composition rules (or by constructing suitable example configurations), one finds that if x is EC to y and y is PO to z, then x and z can be:

• DC (disconnected),  
• EC (externally connected),  
• PO (partially overlapping),  
• TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z), or  
• NTPP (x is a non‐tangential proper part of z).

No other RCC–8 relations are consistent with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).
