PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y < x) and also y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y < z). Consequently, x and z must at least share the common interior region y, so they cannot be DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected). Beyond that, x and z may partially overlap, one may properly contain the other (tangentially or not), or they may even coincide. Hence, the possible relations are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z).

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z).
