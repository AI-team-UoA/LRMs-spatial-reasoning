PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

First note that TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x (y is wholly inside x and their boundaries touch). Also, DC(y,z) means that y and z are completely disjoint (no shared points, neither in the interior nor on the boundary).

Because y is wholly inside x, the fact that y is disjoint from z tells us nothing that would force x itself to be disjoint from z. For x and z, all of the following are consistent with y ⊂ x and DC(y,z):

• DC(x,z): x and z themselves may also be disjoint.  
• EC(x,z): x and z may touch only at a boundary (externally connected).  
• PO(x,z): x and z may partially overlap (share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other).  
• TPPi(x,z): equivalently TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Since y and z can both fit disjointly inside x, z can still be a tangential part of x.  
• NTPPi(x,z): equivalently NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (contained in x without boundary contact), which again is compatible with y and z being disjoint.  

However, the other three RCC-8 relations (TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), EQ(x,z)) would force x to be inside z or coincide with z, thereby forcing y to also be inside or coincide with z—contradicting DC(y,z). Hence, those are not possible.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
