{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given NTPP(x, y) (meaning x is a non\u2010tangential proper part of y) and EQ(y, z) (meaning y and z are identical), we substitute z for y in the first relation to obtain that x is a non\u2010tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x, z).\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x, z)", "elapsed-time": 6.869231700897217, "reasoning-tokens": 576, "completion-tokens": 677}
