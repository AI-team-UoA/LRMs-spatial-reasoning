{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical, we can replace y with x in the relation TPP(y,z). Therefore, we deduce that TPP(x,z) holds.\n\n### Answer: TPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 5.817156076431274, "reasoning-tokens": 512, "completion-tokens": 602}
