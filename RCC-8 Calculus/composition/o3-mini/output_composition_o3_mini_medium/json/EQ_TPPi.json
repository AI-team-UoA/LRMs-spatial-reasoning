{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "We start with the hypotheses:\n\n1. EQ(x, y) means x and y are identical.\n2. TPPi(y, z) is defined as TPP(z, y); that is, z is a tangential proper part of y.\n\nSince EQ(x, y) (i.e. x = y), we can substitute x for y in TPP(z, y); thus, we obtain TPP(z, x). By definition, TPP(z, x) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, which is exactly what TPPi(x, z) denotes (since TPPi(x, z) is defined as TPP(z, x)).\n\nTherefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x, z).\n\n### Answer: TPPi(x, z)", "elapsed-time": 15.17733645439148, "reasoning-tokens": 1792, "completion-tokens": 2012}
