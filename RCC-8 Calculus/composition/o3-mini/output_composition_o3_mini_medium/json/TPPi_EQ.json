{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "We begin with TPPi(x, y), which by definition is equivalent to TPP(y, x). This tells us that y is a proper part of x and touches x\u2019s boundary. The second premise EQ(y, z) tells us that y and z are exactly the same region (they share all the same points).\n\nSubstituting z for y in TPP(y, x) immediately gives TPP(z, x).\n\nSince TPP(z, x) is exactly the statement that z is a proper part of x and touches its boundary, by the definition of the inverse relation we have that TPP(z, x) is the same as TPPi(x, z).\n\nThus, the only possible relation between x and z is TPPi(x, z).\n\n### Answer: TPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 13.008188247680664, "reasoning-tokens": 1600, "completion-tokens": 1818}
