{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(x, y) means that x and y are identical regions, any spatial relation that holds between y and another region z will also hold between x and z. Thus, if PO(y, z) holds (which means y and z partially overlap but neither is contained in the other), then by substituting x for y, we obtain PO(x, z).\n\n### Answer: PO", "elapsed-time": 4.481290340423584, "reasoning-tokens": 384, "completion-tokens": 474}
