{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given TPP(x, y) (x is a proper part of y that touches y\u2019s boundary) and EQ(y, z) (y and z are identical), we can substitute y with z. Thus, TPP(x, y) becomes TPP(x, z). \n\n### Answer: TPP(x, z)", "elapsed-time": 8.196062088012695, "reasoning-tokens": 768, "completion-tokens": 878}
