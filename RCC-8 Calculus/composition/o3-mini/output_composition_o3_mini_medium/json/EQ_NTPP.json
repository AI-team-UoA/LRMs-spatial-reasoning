{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(x, y) means that x and y are exactly the same, we can substitute x for y in the relation NTPP(y, z). This substitution gives us NTPP(x, z). Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is that x is a non\u2010tangential proper part of z.\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x, z)", "elapsed-time": 5.614222049713135, "reasoning-tokens": 512, "completion-tokens": 604}
