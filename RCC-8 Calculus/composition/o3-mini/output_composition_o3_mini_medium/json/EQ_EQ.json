{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that EQ(x, y) means x is the same as y, and EQ(y, z) means y is the same as z, by the transitive property of equality, it follows that x must be the same as z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is EQ(x, z).\n\n### Answer: EQ(x, z)", "elapsed-time": 3.0656650066375732, "reasoning-tokens": 128, "completion-tokens": 212}
