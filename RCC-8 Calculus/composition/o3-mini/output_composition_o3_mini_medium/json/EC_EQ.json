{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(y, z) means that y and z are identical, we can substitute z for y in the relation EC(x, y). Therefore, EC(x, y) becomes EC(x, z).\n\n### Answer: EC(x, z)", "elapsed-time": 7.945945501327515, "reasoning-tokens": 320, "completion-tokens": 401}
