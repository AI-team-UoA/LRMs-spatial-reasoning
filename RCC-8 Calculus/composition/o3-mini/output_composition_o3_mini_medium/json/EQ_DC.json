{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(x, y) means that x and y are identical, any spatial relationship that holds for y will hold for x as well. Given DC(y, z), replacing y with x immediately gives DC(x, z). \n\n### Answer: DC", "elapsed-time": 4.016664981842041, "reasoning-tokens": 256, "completion-tokens": 336}
