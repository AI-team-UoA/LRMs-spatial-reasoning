{"prompt": "If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical, we can substitute z for y in the relation DC(x,y). This yields DC(x,z).\n\n### Answer: DC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 4.279844522476196, "reasoning-tokens": 384, "completion-tokens": 458}
