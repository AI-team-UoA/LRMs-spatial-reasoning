{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x,y), we have x = y. Therefore, any spatial relation that holds between y and z will also hold between x and z. Since EC(y,z) holds, we conclude that EC(x,z) holds.\n\n### Answer: EC", "elapsed-time": 4.422005891799927, "reasoning-tokens": 384, "completion-tokens": 447}
