PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given assumptions. Recall that TPPi(x,y) is defined as TPP(y,x); that is, y is a tangential proper part of x (so y ⊂ x and y touches x’s boundary). Also, NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non‐tangential proper part of z (y ⊂ z and y does not touch z’s boundary).

Thus we have:
 (1) y ⊂ x, with y touching the boundary of x,
 (2) y ⊂ z, with y completely inside (away from the boundary of) z.

Since y is included in both x and z, x and z must have a non‐empty intersection. However, the fact that y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z does not force either x ⊆ z or z ⊆ x; indeed, two scenarios are possible:

• It is possible that x is wholly contained in z. In this case, whether x touches the boundary of z or not is left open. If x touches z’s boundary then the relation is TPP(x,z); if it lies completely in the interior of z then it is NTPP(x,z).

• Alternatively, x might not be entirely contained in z (and z is not contained in x either), in which case x and z share some but not all parts – that is, they partially overlap. This is the PO (partial overlap) relation.

Thus, the only possibilities for the relation between x and z are either that x is a proper part of z (either tangentially: TPP , or non‐tangentially: NTPP) or that x and z partially overlap (PO).

### Answer: TPP, NTPP, and PO.
