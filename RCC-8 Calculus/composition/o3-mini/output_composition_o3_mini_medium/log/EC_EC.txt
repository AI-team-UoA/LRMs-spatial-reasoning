PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the following:

• EC(x,y) means x and y “touch” each other—that is, their boundaries intersect but their interiors do not.
• EC(y,z) means y and z “touch” each other in the same way.

Now, imagine three regions x, y, and z arranged in space so that x touches y and y touches z. There are several ways to “build a chain” between x and z. Here are the possibilities:

1. DC (Disconnected): It is quite possible that the touching between x and y occurs at a different “place” on y than the touching between y and z. In such an arrangement x and z have no point in common (not even a boundary point) so they are DC.

2. EC (Externally Connected): One can also arrange the three regions so that the point (or segment) of contact between x and y coincides with that between y and z. In that case x and z will also “touch” each other (they share a boundary point) but not share any interior parts, so they are externally connected.

3. PO (Partially Overlapping): Finally, it is also possible to “chain” the three regions in a way that forces x and z to have some overlapping interior—while still having x EC y and y EC z. In such a situation x and z share a part of their interiors but neither is a part of the other; that is exactly the PO relation.

No other RCC‐8 relation can arise under these assumptions. So, if EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then the relation between x and z can be any one of DC, EC, or PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, or PO
