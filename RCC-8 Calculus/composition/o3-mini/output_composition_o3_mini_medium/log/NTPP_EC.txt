PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the information that NTPP(x, y) means that x is a proper part of y and, crucially, x does not touch y’s boundary (its closure is contained entirely in the interior of y). Also, EC(y, z) means that y and z are externally connected – they touch at their boundaries, but do not share any interior points.

Since x is entirely inside y (and away from y’s boundary), it cannot reach the boundary of y. Because z only touches y at the boundary, the interior of x cannot come into contact with z at all. Therefore, x and z must be spatially separated, i.e. disconnected.
