PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

One way to answer this is by considering how the specified relations interact. We are given that:

• EC(x,y): x touches y at a boundary, but they share no interior.
• DC(y,z): y and z are completely disconnected (share no point).

Now, let’s visualize or reason through what may happen between x and z. Since x touches y and y is totally separated from z, any interaction between x and z must come from parts of x that are not “influenced” by y.

Imagine three regions arranged in the plane. x touches y along part of its boundary. The region y, however, is completely separated from z. This leaves a couple of possibilities:

1. x and z might be completely separated. That is, apart from its contact with y, x might have no contact with z. In that case, x and z are DC (disconnected).

2. x might touch z along some boundary without sharing an interior. Then x and z would be externally connected (EC).

3. Alternatively, a part of x (not that part touching y) might extend so as to overlap with z’s interior even though y is not involved. Then x and z would share some interior, meaning they are partially overlapping (PO).

Thus, based on the RCC-8 relations and the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
  DC(x,z), EC(x,z), or PO(x,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z) and PO(x,z)
