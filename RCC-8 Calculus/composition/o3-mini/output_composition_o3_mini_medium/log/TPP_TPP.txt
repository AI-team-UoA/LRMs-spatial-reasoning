PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since x is a tangential proper part of y (meaning x is a part of y and touches y’s boundary) and y is a tangential proper part of z, it follows that x is a proper part of z. However, whether x touches the boundary of z or not is not fixed by these conditions. Therefore, x may either be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) if it touches the boundary of z, or a non‐tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)) if it does not.

### Answer: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
