PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the assumptions:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they do not share any part, including boundary)
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z, and at least one point of y is on the boundary of z).

Now, imagine that y lies (touching the boundary) inside z. The fact that x is disconnected from y tells us that x does not “touch” or “intersect” y. However, x’s placement relative to z can vary. For example:

• x might lie entirely outside z. Then x is completely separated from z, meaning DC(x,z).

• x might be arranged so that it touches z (for instance, x can be adjacent to z) while still being away from y. This gives EC(x,z).

• x might partially invade z and partly lie outside z, without overlapping y. In that case x and z share some interior, but not in a containment sense – so their relation is PO(x,z).

• x might lie entirely within z. In that case there are two subcases:
  – x might lie in such a way that it touches the boundary of z (as y does), which gives TPP(x,z).
  – or else x lies fully inside z (not touching its boundary), which gives NTPP(x,z).

Other RCC-8 possibilities (such as x being the same as z, or x containing z) would either force some overlap with y (violating DC(x,y)) or contradict the direction of containment in TPP(y,z).

Thus, given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) the possible relationships between x and z are:
  • DC (Disconnected)
  • EC (Externally Connected)
  • PO (Partial Overlap)
  • TPP (Tangential Proper Part)
  • NTPP (Non‐Tangential Proper Part)

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
