PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the definitions:

• TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary.
• NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z but its boundary does not touch the boundary of z.

Since y is a non‐tangential proper part of z, every point of y (and therefore every point of x ⊆ y) lies in the interior of z. Hence x cannot reach the boundary of z.

Thus, even though x touches the boundary of y (as required by TPP(x,y)), this “touching” does not extend to z because y is entirely contained in the interior of z. Therefore, in the relation between x and z, x is a proper part of z that does not touch z’s boundary.

The only possible relation for x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
