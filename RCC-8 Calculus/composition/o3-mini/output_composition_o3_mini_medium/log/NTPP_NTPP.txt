PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y’s boundary (so the closure of x is strictly inside y) and similarly NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z without touching z’s boundary, we have the following.

Since x is contained entirely inside y (with a “buffer” from y’s boundary) and y is entirely contained inside z (again with a “buffer” from z’s boundary), it follows that the closure of x (being a subset of the interior of y) will also be a subset of the interior of z. In other words, x is properly contained in z and does not reach z’s boundary.

Thus, the only relation that can hold between x and z is a non‐tangential proper part relation, written as NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
