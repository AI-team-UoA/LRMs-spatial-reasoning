PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x, y) means x is the same as y, and EQ(y, z) means y is the same as z, by the transitive property of equality, it follows that x must be the same as z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is EQ(x, z).

### Answer: EQ(x, z)
