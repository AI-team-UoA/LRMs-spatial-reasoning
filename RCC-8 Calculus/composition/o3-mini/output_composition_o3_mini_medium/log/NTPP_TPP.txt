PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that

 • NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and x’s closure does not touch y’s boundary (so x is “safely inside” y), and

 • TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and y touches z’s boundary,

we can reason as follows:

1. Since x NTPP y, x is completely contained in the interior of y (none of x touches y’s boundary).

2. Since y TPP z, y is contained in z and at least one point of y’s boundary meets the boundary of z. However, note that the interior of y (which contains all of x) is still fully contained in the interior of z. In other words, even though y as a whole touches z’s boundary, the “inner part” of y (its interior) is safely away from z’s boundary.

3. Therefore, x – being a subset of the interior of y – will also have its closure strictly contained in the interior of z. That is, x does not get close enough to z’s boundary to “touch” it.

Thus, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, written as NTPP(x,z).
