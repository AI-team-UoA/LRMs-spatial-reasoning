PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the givens:
1. DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected, so they share no common parts—not even at a boundary.
2. PO(y, z): y and z partially overlap; that is, y and z share some but not all parts and neither is completely contained in the other.

We want to know what may hold for x and z. Although there is no unique answer, we must consider all spatial configurations that satisfy the given conditions.

Because x is entirely separated from y (DC), any interaction between x and z must occur through parts of z that lie outside y. For example:

• It is possible that z is “far-away” from x so that x and z are also disconnected. This gives DC(x, z).

• Alternatively, x might come in contact with z (touching its boundary) even though it remains apart from y. That is, x could be externally connected to z: EC(x, z).

• It is also possible that x and z do share some interior points (with x’s overlapping region lying in the part of z that does not intersect y). In that case x and z partially overlap, so we have PO(x, z).

• Another possibility is that x may lie entirely within z. In that case there are two subcases:
  – x might be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z (TPP(x, z)).
  – or x might lie entirely in the interior of z (so as not even to touch the boundary), i.e. NTPP(x, z).

Notice that the reverse containment cases (TPPi and NTPPi) would force y to overlap with a part of x, contradicting DC(x, y).

Thus, given DC(x, y) and PO(y, z), the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:
  DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.
