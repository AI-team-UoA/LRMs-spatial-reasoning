PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the information that

  NTPPi(x,y) (which, by definition, means NTPP(y,x) or “y is a non‐tangential proper part of x”)  
  DC(y,z)    (the regions y and z are disconnected, i.e. they do not touch at all).

Since y is a non‐tangential proper part of x, it lies entirely within x and is “buffered” away from the boundary of x. Now, because y and z are disconnected, z does not meet any part of y. This already gives us some clues about how x and z might relate. The region x, however, can extend well beyond y so that z might interact with x in several ways as long as z does not “invade” y. For example, it is perfectly possible for z to meet part of x as long as the part of x containing y remains separated from z.

A number of RCC-8 relations between x and z are then possible:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be totally separate.  
  Example: x is a large region containing y, and z is far away so that neither touches x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z may touch at their boundaries.  
  Example: x is a region that contains y in its interior, and z touches x just along the boundary while remaining away from y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z may partially overlap (share some proper part) without one being contained in the other.  
  Example: x overlaps z in the part outside of y.

4. TPPi(x,z): This relation means that z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e. z TPP x, or equivalently TPPi(x,z)).  
  Example: z is a region completely inside x that touches x’s boundary, but it is located so that it is disjoint from y.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This means that z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e. z NTPP x).  
  Example: z lies entirely within x and is “buffered” from the boundary of x, and yet is arranged in a part of x that does not meet y.

It is not possible, for instance, for x to be a proper part of z because that would force y ⊆ x ⊆ z and then y would share interior with z, contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, given NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
