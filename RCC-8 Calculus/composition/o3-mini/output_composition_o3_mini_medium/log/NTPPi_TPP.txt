PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given information:

• NTPPi(x,y) is defined to be the same as NTPP(y,x). In words, this means that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e. y is wholly contained in the interior of x).

• TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z (i.e. y is contained in z and touches part of its boundary).

Thus we have:
 • y is strictly inside x (without touching x’s boundary),
 • y is inside z with y touching z’s boundary.

Because y is common to both x and z, there must be some overlap between x and z. However, nothing in the premises forces x and z into a unique relation; more than one configuration is possible. In particular, one may have:

1. x ⊆ z. In this case every point of x is in z. But because y (a subset of x) touches z’s boundary, x must itself come “close” to z’s boundary. Hence x is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary; that is, x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

2. z ⊆ x. Here z is a proper part of x (and by the RCC‐8 notation this is written as TPPi(x,z), meaning TPP(z,x)). In this configuration the “smaller” region z is entirely inside x (with z touching x’s boundary).

3. Alternatively, neither region needs be fully contained in the other. In this case we have that x and z overlap (PO(x,z)) but neither is a proper part of the other.

Thus, given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible RCC‐8 relationships between x and z are: 
 • TPP(x,z)
 • TPPi(x,z)
 • PO(x,z)

### Answer: TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or PO(x,z)
