PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start by rewriting the given relations in an equivalent form. Recall that

  • NTPPi(x,y) means the same as NTPP(y,x): y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e. y is entirely inside x and its boundary does not touch the boundary of x).

  • TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e. z is inside y and its boundary touches the boundary of y).

Now, we have:
  z ⊆ y ⊆ x,
with y being a “well–inside” x (non–tangentially) and z “pushing” against y’s boundary.

Because y is non‐tangentially contained in x, its boundary is a positive distance away from x’s boundary. Although z touches y’s boundary (because z TPP y), it cannot reach x’s boundary (since that boundary is separated from y by a gap). Therefore z is entirely in the interior of x, and the “touching” that z exhibits is only with y’s boundary and not with x’s boundary.

In RCC-8 terms, since z is a proper part of x and its boundary does not reach x’s boundary, z is a non‐tangential proper part of x. Expressing this in the given notation we have:
  NTPP(z,x)
which is equivalent to saying
  NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
