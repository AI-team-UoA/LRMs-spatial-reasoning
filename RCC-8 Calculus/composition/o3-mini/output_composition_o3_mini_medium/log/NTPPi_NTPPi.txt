PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Recall that by definition NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x) – i.e. y is a non‐tangential proper part of x. Likewise, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y).

So we have:
  NTPP(z,y): z is inside y (proper part without touching y’s boundary)
  NTPP(y,x): y is inside x (proper part without touching x’s boundary)

Since the NTPP relation is transitive (a property of the RCC–8 calculus), it follows that z is a non–tangential proper part of x – in other words,
  NTPP(z,x)

Equivalently, by the definition of NTPPi, this gives:
  NTPPi(x,z)

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z under the given conditions is that x and z are related by NTPPi (i.e. z is a non–tangential proper part of x).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z) (equivalently, NTPP(z,x))
