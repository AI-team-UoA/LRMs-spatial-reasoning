PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EC(x,y) means that x touches the boundary of y (without sharing any interior with y) and NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)—meaning that z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (z lies entirely within y’s interior and does not touch its boundary)—every point of z is strictly inside y while every contact of x with y is on y’s boundary. Thus there is no way for x to “reach” z. The only possible relationship between x and z is that they are spatially disconnected.
