PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the hypotheses:

1. EQ(x, y) means x and y are identical.
2. TPPi(y, z) is defined as TPP(z, y); that is, z is a tangential proper part of y.

Since EQ(x, y) (i.e. x = y), we can substitute x for y in TPP(z, y); thus, we obtain TPP(z, x). By definition, TPP(z, x) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, which is exactly what TPPi(x, z) denotes (since TPPi(x, z) is defined as TPP(z, x)).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x, z).

### Answer: TPPi(x, z)
