PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We begin with TPPi(x, y), which by definition is equivalent to TPP(y, x). This tells us that y is a proper part of x and touches xâ€™s boundary. The second premise EQ(y, z) tells us that y and z are exactly the same region (they share all the same points).

Substituting z for y in TPP(y, x) immediately gives TPP(z, x).

Since TPP(z, x) is exactly the statement that z is a proper part of x and touches its boundary, by the definition of the inverse relation we have that TPP(z, x) is the same as TPPi(x, z).

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is TPPi(x, z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
