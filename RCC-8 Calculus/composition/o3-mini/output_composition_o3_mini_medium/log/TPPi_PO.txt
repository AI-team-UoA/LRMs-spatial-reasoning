PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two given facts. First, TPPi(x,y) is defined to be equivalent to TPP(y,x). Thus, what we know is:
  TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x (that is, y is contained in x, is not equal to x, and its boundary touches the boundary of x).

Second, PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap; that is, they share some but not all parts (neither is a subset of the other).

We now want to determine what possibilities this leaves for the relationship between x and z.

Because y ⊆ x and y overlaps z, we know that x and z must intersect (so they cannot be disconnected, DC). Moreover, note that z cannot contain x (since then y, being a subset of x, would be contained in z; that would give a proper‐part relation rather than PO between y and z).

There are two main cases to consider regarding how z is placed relative to x:

1. z is not entirely contained in x. Then z “straddles” the boundary of x. In that case x and z overlap – they share some portion (namely, at least the part where y is situated) but neither is contained in the other. This is exactly the PO relation between x and z.

2. z is entirely contained in x. Then, since y ⊆ x and y overlaps z, it must be that z contains parts outside of y (so that neither y ⊆ z nor z ⊆ y holds). In this situation x is “bigger” than z, and so z is a proper part of x. But note that, depending on how z is placed within x we have two possibilities:
  a. If the boundary of z touches the boundary of x then z is a tangential proper part of x. In RCC‐8 language (with the first argument being x) this is written TPPi(x,z) (since TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x)).
  b. If the boundary of z lies entirely in the interior of x then z is a non‐tangential proper part of x. In RCC‐8 language this is written NTPPi(x,z) (since NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x)).

There is no possibility for x and z to be EC (externally connected) because if x were only “touching” z then x’s interior (which contains y) would not intersect z’s interior; and it cannot be that x is a proper part of z (TPP/NTPP in the “forward” direction) because then y ⊆ x ⊆ z, making y a proper part of z (contradicting PO(y,z)).

Thus, taking both cases together, the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:
  • PO(x,z)
  • TPPi(x,z)   (i.e. x and z such that z is a tangential proper part of x)
  • NTPPi(x,z)  (i.e. x and z such that z is a non‐tangential proper part of x)

We now give the final answer in the requested form.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
