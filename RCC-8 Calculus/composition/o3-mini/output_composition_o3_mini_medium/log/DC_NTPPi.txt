PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the facts:
1. DC(x,y) means that x and y share no spatial parts; in particular, no point of x is a point of y.
2. NTPPi(y,z) is defined as NTPP(z,y), meaning that z is a proper part of y whose closure lies entirely within the interior of y (i.e. z does not touch the boundary of y).

Since z is (non‐tangentially) a proper part of y, every point of z is also a point of y. Now, because DC(x,y) tells us that x and y have no points in common, it follows immediately that x and z cannot have any points in common either.

Could it be that x and z are “externally connected” (EC)? Recall that EC means their interiors do not overlap, but their boundaries do touch. However, if x and z were EC then there would be some shared boundary point of x and z. Such a point, since z is entirely inside the interior of y, would then lie inside y. But that would be a shared spatial point with y, contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus the only possibility is that x and z, like x and y, are completely disjoint in all respects. In terms of RCC‑8, this is expressed by the relation DC.
