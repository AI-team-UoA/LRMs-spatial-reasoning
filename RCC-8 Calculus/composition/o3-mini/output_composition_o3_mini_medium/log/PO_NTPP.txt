PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We begin with the given conditions:

1. PO(x, y) tells us that x and y have a non‐empty overlap (both share some interior part) but neither is a subset of the other.
2. NTPP(y, z) tells us that y is a non-tangential proper part of z; that is, y is completely contained in z and does not touch z’s boundary.

Now, since y ⊆ z (and is fully within its interior), any region that overlaps with y (such as x, because x ∩ y ≠ ∅) must at least partly lie in z. However, nothing prevents x from extending outside of z. Thus, two broad cases arise:

Case 1. x is not entirely contained in z.
 • Here, part of x lies inside z (because it overlaps y ⊆ z) and part outside. In this situation, the best description of the spatial relation between x and z is PO (partial overlap).

Case 2. x is entirely contained in z.
 • In that case, we have x ⊆ z. But note that since x PO y, x is not a subset of y. Nevertheless, it is possible for x to be completely inside z while overlapping y, as long as some part of x lies outside y. Once x is fully contained in z, there are two possibilities:
  – If x touches the boundary of z then the relation is TPP(x, z).
  – If x does not touch the boundary of z then the relation is NTPP(x, z).

There is no possibility for relations like DC or EC because x definitely overlaps with z (due to the non-empty intersection x ∩ y ⊆ z). Similarly, x cannot equal z because that would conflict with the proper part relationship required for NTPP(y,z).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are:
 • PO(x, z) – if x extends partially outside z,
 • TPP(x, z) – if x is fully inside z and touches its boundary, or
 • NTPP(x, z) – if x is fully inside z and does not touch the boundary.

### Answer: The possible relationships between x and z are PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).
