PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the information that NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which tells us that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x. Next, given EQ(y,z) we know that y and z are spatially identical. By substituting z for y, we obtain NTPP(z,x), which means that z is a non‐tangential proper part of x. By definition, NTPPi(x,z) is exactly the converse of NTPP(z,x). 

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
