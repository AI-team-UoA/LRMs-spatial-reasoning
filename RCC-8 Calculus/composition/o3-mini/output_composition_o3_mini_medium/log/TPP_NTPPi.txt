PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given relations. TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and x touches y’s boundary. Also, by definition, NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (that is, z is entirely in the interior of y, so it does not touch y’s boundary).

Thus, we have:
  x ⊆ y, and some points of x reach y’s boundary,
  z ⊆ y, with z completely contained in the interior of y.

Because z is “well inside” y while x reaches out to y’s boundary, x cannot be a subset of z (nor can z be a subset of x). In other words, neither x nor z is “nested” inside the other. What are the possible relationships between x and z then?

Consider the following cases:
1. It may be that x and z are located in different parts of y so that they do not share any common points. In that case the relation between x and z is DC (“disconnected”).
2. It may be that although x and z do not overlap in their interiors, they meet at a point or along a portion of their boundaries. In that case the relation is EC (“externally connected”).
3. Alternatively, they might have overlapping regions (with some but not all of each region in common) without one being a subset of the other. Since neither can be a proper part of the other (for the reasons explained), this is the PO (“partial overlap”) case.

Thus, the only possibilities for the relation between x and z are: DC, EC, and PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO.
