PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given information:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means, by definition, that NTPP(y,x) holds. In words, y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (y is “well inside” x, not touching x’s boundary).

2. PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other.

Now, since y is (non‐tangentially) inside x, we know that y is completely in the interior of x. Because y and z overlap (they share some interior), the intersection y ∩ z is nonempty and lies in the interior of x.

There are two general situations for z relative to x:

A. z is not completely contained in x. In this case z “spills out” of x to some degree. Since y ⊆ x and y touches z, x and z share an interior region (namely, at least the part of y that is in common with z) but neither x ⊆ z nor z ⊆ x holds. Hence, in this case the relation between x and z is PO.

B. z is completely contained in x. Then, because y ⊆ z (at least in part, by virtue of y ∩ z ≠ ∅) and z ⊆ x, the relation between x and z is one of “proper part” (that is, z is a proper part of x). In RCC-8 terms the proper part relation comes in two flavors:
  • If z touches the boundary of x then x and z are in a tangential proper part relation, so we have TPPi(x,z) (recall TPPi(x,z) ≡ TPP(z,x)).
  • If z does not touch the boundary of x then the relation is non‐tangential, so we must have NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z (expressed with x as the first argument) are exactly these three:
  – PO(x,z),
  – TPPi(x,z), and
  – NTPPi(x,z).

Any other RCC‑8 relation (DC, EC, EQ, TPP, NTPP) is ruled out by the combination of NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z)
