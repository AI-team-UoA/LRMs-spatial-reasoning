PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the definitions (using the RCC‐8 relations):

• TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary.
• PO(y,z): y and z share some interior part (so they overlap) but neither is contained in the other.

Now, suppose we know TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) and we want to deduce what relation might hold between x and z. The key point is that x is a proper part of y while y only partially overlaps z. Because y is not a subset of z, there is a “split” in y – some parts of y fall inside z and some fall outside z. Since x lies entirely in y, there are several possibilities depending on where x is located inside y:

1. x might lie entirely inside the portion of y that overlaps z. In that case, x is also a proper part of z. However, whether x touches z’s boundary depends on exactly how x is situated relative to z’s boundary. (If x does touch z’s boundary then we have TPP(x,z); if not, then NTPP(x,z).)

2. x might be “split” by the fact that part of y overlaps with z while another part does not. Then x itself could have some overlap with z (but not be contained within z) so that x and z share some but not all of x’s parts. In RCC‑8 this is captured by PO(x,z).

3. Finally, it is also possible that although x ⊆ y, x is located entirely inside the portion of y that does not overlap with z. Then x is not even connected to z. In this case x and z are disconnected (DC). There is also the possibility that x “just touches” z (without any interior overlap) so that they are externally connected (EC).

Thus, depending on the geometry, the relationship between x and z might be any of DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

Note that none of the other RCC‑8 relations (TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible in this scenario.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
