PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We know that PO(x,y) means that x and y share some interior but neither is contained in the other. Also, TPP(y,z) tells us that y is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary.

Because y ⊆ z, there is at least one point (in fact, a whole region—the overlap x ∩ y) of x that is inside z. However, x itself may or may not lie completely in z. Two general cases arise:

1. x is not entirely contained in z. Then even though part of x (namely, the intersection with y) is in z, x still has portions outside z. In this case the relation between x and z is PO (they overlap but one is not a subset of the other).

2. x is entirely contained in z. In this case x is a proper part of z. But note that in RCC-8, even when one region is a proper part of another, there are two possibilities:
  a. x might touch the boundary of z, in which case x is a tangential proper part (TPP) of z.
  b. x might lie entirely in the interior of z (not touching the boundary), in which case x is a non‐tangential proper part (NTPP) of z.

Thus, depending on the exact spatial configuration of x relative to z (which is not determined solely by the statements “PO(x,y)” and “TPP(y,z)”), the possible relations between x and z are either PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: PO, TPP, or NTPP.
