PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that:

• EC(x,y) – x touches y at a boundary (with no interior overlap).

• TPP(y,z) – y is a tangential proper part of z (y is contained in z and touches z’s boundary).

Since y ⊆ z, any point of y is also a point of z. Because x is externally connected to y, x must share at least one boundary point with y—and therefore with z. This already rules out the possibility that x and z are completely disconnected (DC).

Now, let’s consider how x might be located relative to z:

1. x might lie entirely within z. Then x is a proper part of z. Depending on whether x’s boundary touches z’s boundary or lies entirely in the interior, the relation between x and z can be either:
  • TPP(x,z) (if x touches the boundary of z) or
  • NTPP(x,z) (if x is completely inside z without touching the boundary).

2. Alternatively, x might straddle the boundary of z. In other words, part of x is inside z and part is outside, yet x still touches y (which is inside z). In this case x and z share some but not all regions, which is the RCC–8 PO (partial overlap) relation.

Thus, based solely on EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible RCC–8 relations that can hold between x and z are:

• EC(x,z)
• PO(x,z)
• TPP(x,z)
• NTPP(x,z)

(Notice that “EC(x,z)” is a possibility when x touches z at the point where y touches z.)

### Answer: EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
