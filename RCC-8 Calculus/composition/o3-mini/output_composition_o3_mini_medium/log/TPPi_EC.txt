PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start by recalling the meanings of the relations:

• TPPi(x,y) is defined to be the same as TPP(y,x). That is, y is a tangential proper part of x (y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of x).

• EC(y,z) means that y and z share a boundary point (their boundaries touch) but their interiors do not intersect.

Now, from TPPi(x,y) we have y ⊂ x with y touching the boundary of x. Since y and z are externally connected (EC), they share a part of their boundaries. Because y is inside x, there are two main scenarios for how z might lie relative to x:

1. z may “just touch” x along the boundary. For example, imagine x as a large circle, y a smaller circle inside x that touches x’s boundary, and z as a region outside x that meets y exactly at the point (or an arc) where y touches x. In this case x and z share that boundary point and so are externally connected (EC).

2. Alternatively, z might extend so that it overlaps x’s interior. For instance, z might include the boundary contact with y but also extend into the interior of x. Then x and z would have a non‐empty interior intersection without one being a proper subset of the other; that is, they partially overlap (PO).

Other RCC‑8 relations (such as one region being a proper part of the other, or being totally disconnected) are not possible under these constraints. 

Thus, the only two plausible qualitative spatial relationships between x and z are EC and PO.

### Answer: The possible relationships between x and z are EC and PO.
