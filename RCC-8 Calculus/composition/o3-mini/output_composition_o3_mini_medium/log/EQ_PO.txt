PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(x, y) means that x and y are identical regions, any spatial relation that holds between y and another region z will also hold between x and z. Thus, if PO(y, z) holds (which means y and z partially overlap but neither is contained in the other), then by substituting x for y, we obtain PO(x, z).

### Answer: PO
