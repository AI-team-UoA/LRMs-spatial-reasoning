PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two given facts:

  1. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected. In RCC‐8 terms, this means x and y share part of a boundary only (their interiors do not intersect).

  2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non‐tangential proper part of z. That is, y is entirely inside z and does not touch z’s boundary.

Now, consider what these imply for the relation between x and z.

Because y is entirely inside z (with a “margin” from z’s boundary), and x touches y (sharing a boundary point of y), x can be arranged relative to z in at least two different ways:

1. x is entirely inside z. In this case x is a proper part of z. However, even if x ⊆ z, there are two possibilities:
  • x may touch the boundary of z – in which case the relation is TPP(x,z)
  • or x may lie wholly in the interior of z – so that NTPP(x,z) holds.
  Thus, if x is completely contained in z, the possible relations are TPP or NTPP.

2. x straddles the border of z. In other words, x is only partially inside z (it touches y which is inside z, but part of x lies outside z). In that case x and z share some but not all parts and neither is a subset of the other; that is the PO (partial overlap) relation.

One may check that the other RCC‐8 relations are not possible here. For example, if x were DC (disconnected from z) then there would be no way for x to have a point in common with y (which is inside z). Similarly, x cannot contain z (or be equal to z) because that would imply y is a proper part of x, contradicting EC(x,y).

Thus, the only possibilities for the relation between x and z are:
  • TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) (when x is entirely inside z),
  • PO(x,z) (when x overlaps z but is not entirely contained).

### Answer:
TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).
