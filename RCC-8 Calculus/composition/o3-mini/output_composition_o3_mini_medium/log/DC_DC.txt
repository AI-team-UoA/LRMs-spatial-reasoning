PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

There is no further constraint on the relation between x and z from the information that x is disconnected from y and y is disconnected from z. One may construct examples where x and z are disconnected, externally connected (EC), partly overlapping (PO), one is a proper part of the other (TPP or its converse, TPPi, or even the non‚Äêtouching cases NTPP/NTPPi), or even equal (EQ).

Thus, the complete list of possible relationships between x and z is:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z)
