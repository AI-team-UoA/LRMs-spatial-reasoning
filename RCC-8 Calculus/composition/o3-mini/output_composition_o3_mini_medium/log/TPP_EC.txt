PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary, and EC(y,z) means that y and z share only a boundary (with no interior overlap), we can reason as follows:

• Since x is completely contained in y, its interior is a subset of the interior of y.
• Because y and z share only a boundary (their interiors do not intersect), the interior of x (being inside y’s interior) cannot intersect the interior of z.
• However, it is possible that x, because it touches the boundary of y, might also touch the shared boundary between y and z when z externally connects to y.

Thus there are two possibilities for the relation between x and z:
 – If x does not extend all the way to the shared boundary with z, then x and z will be DisConnected (DC).
 – If x does extend to the boundary, then x and z will be Externally Connected (EC).

No other RCC-8 relation (such as PO, TPP, etc.) is possible under these constraints.

### Answer: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)
