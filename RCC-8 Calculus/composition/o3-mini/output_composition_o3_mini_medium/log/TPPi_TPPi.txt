PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x) (that is, y is a tangential proper part of x) and TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y) (z is a tangential proper part of y), we have a chain of proper part relations: z ⊆ y ⊆ x. In other words, z is a proper part of x. However, whether z touches the boundary of x or lies entirely in its interior may vary. That is, when combining the two tangential proper part relations, z can either:

• Touch x’s boundary, in which case z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalently, TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z)); or
• Not touch x’s boundary, in which case z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (equivalently, NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z)).

Thus, the only possible relationships between x and z are that z is either a tangential or a non‐tangential proper part of x.

### Answer: Either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).
