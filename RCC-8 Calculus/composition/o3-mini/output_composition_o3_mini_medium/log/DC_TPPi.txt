PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that x and y are disconnected (DC(x,y)), which means they have no points (neither interior nor boundary) in common. Also, TPPi(y,z) is defined as TPP(z,y), which tells us that z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e. z âŠ† y, z is not equal to y, and z touches the boundary of y).

Since z is a part of y and x has no points in common with y, it follows immediately that x must have no points in common with z. In particular, if x were externally connected to z (EC), they would have at least one common boundary point. But that boundary point of z would also be a boundary point of y (due to the TPP relation), contradicting DC(x,y) which requires there to be no common points whatsoever.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is that they are disconnected, i.e. DC(x,z).
