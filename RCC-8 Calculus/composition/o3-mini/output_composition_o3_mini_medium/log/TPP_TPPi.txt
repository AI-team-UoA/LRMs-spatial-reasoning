PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the following information (using “⊊” to denote “proper subset”):

• TPP(x,y) means x ⊊ y and the boundary of x touches that of y.

• TPPi(y,z) is defined as TPP(z,y) – that is, z ⊊ y with z touching y’s boundary.

Thus, we know that both x and z are (proper) parts of y that “reach” y’s boundary. (Note that while x and z can be identical, in most treatments “proper part” is understood to exclude the possibility that the two are equal—but RCC‑8 always keeps EQ as a separate relation if objects are indeed identical.)

Now, imagine “y” as a region and picture x and z as two regions inside y that each touch y’s outer boundary. It is easy to see that many different spatial arrangements of x and z inside y are possible. For instance:

1. x and z may be located far apart (or in non‐adjacent “lobes”) so that they have no common points at all. In that case x and z are DisConnected (DC).

2. They might be arranged so that they “just meet” (touching at a boundary while having no interior overlap). In that case they are Externally Connected (EC).

3. They might overlap partially (so that each has parts that are not in the other, yet they share some interior part). Then the relation is Partial Overlap (PO).

4. It is also possible that one of x and z is contained in the other. For example, if x ⊊ z then x is a proper part of z. Now, by the definitions given there are two ways one may be a proper part. If x touches the boundary of z then we would say TPP(x,z) (and, conversely, TPPi(z,x)); if it does not then we would have NTPP(x,z) (and its converse NTPPi(z,x)). (Note that which one occurs depends on whether the “inner” region touches the boundary of its container.)

Thus, altogether the possible RCC‑8 relations between x and z (when we assume they are not “uninteresting” in the sense of being completely equal) are:
  • DC,
  • EC,
  • PO,
  • TPP (or its converse TPPi), and
  • NTPP (or its converse NTPPi).

Any answer that lists these five possibilities (and, if one wishes to allow the possibility that x = z then EQ also) is correct.

The final answer can therefore be stated as follows:

### Answer:
The possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP (or TPPi), and NTPP (or NTPPi).
