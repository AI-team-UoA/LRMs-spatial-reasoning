PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given information:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means, by definition, that NTPP(y,x) holds. In other words, y is a proper part of x and y does not touch x’s boundary. So y is wholly contained in the interior of x.

2. EC(y,z) means that y and z share some boundary point but their interiors do not intersect.

Now, since y lies entirely in the interior of x, any contact between y and z must occur in the interior of x. This forces z to have a non‐empty intersection with the interior of x. Consequently, x and z cannot be “externally connected” (EC) or “disconnected” (DC) because those would require that their interiors do not overlap. (Also, x cannot be equal to z nor can x be a proper part of z; indeed, if x were contained in z, then y, being inside x, would be inside z and would not be merely EC with z.)

Thus, there are two kinds of configurations to consider:

A. z is not entirely contained in x. In this case z overlaps with x but is not a subset of x. That is, x and z share some interior (because z hits the interior of x by virtue of meeting y) yet part of z lies outside x. This is exactly the PO (“partial overlap”) relation between x and z.

B. z is entirely contained in x. In this case we know that y ⊆ int(x) and y EC z. In other words, z is a proper part of x but arranged so that it touches y’s boundary even though y is deep inside x. In RCC‐8 the relation between x and z (when z ⊆ x) can be one of two kinds:
 • If z touches the boundary of x, then from the perspective of x we have TPPi(x,z) (recall that TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), i.e. z is a tangential proper part of x).
 • If z does not touch the boundary of x (that is, z is entirely in the interior of x) then we have NTPPi(x,z) (which is the same as NTPP(z,x)).

Thus, given our assumptions the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are exactly one of the following three:
 • PO(x,z),
 • TPPi(x,z), or
 • NTPPi(x,z).

This exhausts the possibilities under the RCC-8 constraints.

### Answer: PO(x,z) ∨ TPPi(x,z) ∨ NTPPi(x,z).
