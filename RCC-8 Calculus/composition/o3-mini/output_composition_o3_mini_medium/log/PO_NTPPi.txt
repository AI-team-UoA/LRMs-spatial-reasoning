PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two given facts:

1. PO(x, y): x partially overlaps y. This means that x and y share some but not all of their interior parts (so x is not completely inside y and vice‐versa).

2. NTPPi(y, z): By definition, NTPPi(y, z) means that y is a non‐tangential proper part of z (i.e. y ⊆ z and y does not touch z’s boundary).

Since y is a non‐tangential proper part of z, y ⊆ z completely, and in fact, y is “well inside” z (its boundary is not on the boundary of z).

Now, consider the overlap between x and y given by PO(x, y). Because x overlaps y and y is entirely contained in z, at least part of x must lie inside z. However, x might extend outside of z. This “global” situation gives us two main cases for the relation between x and z:

Case 1. x is not completely contained in z.
  In this case, x has parts both inside and outside z. (The part inside z comes from the overlap with y.) Therefore, x and z share some but not all spatial parts – the relation between x and z is PO.

Case 2. x is completely contained in z.
  Here, all of x lies in z. However, there is still a possibility difference depending on whether x touches the boundary of z or is fully “boxed inside” (i.e. entirely in the interior):
  a. If x touches the boundary of z, then by definition x is a tangential proper part (TPP) of z.
  b. If x is entirely in the interior of z (its boundary does not reach the boundary of z), then x is a non‐tangential proper part (NTPP) of z.

Thus, the possible spatial relationships between x and z given the premises are:

  – PO(x, z) (if x extends partly outside z), 
  – TPP(x, z) (if x ⊆ z and touches z’s boundary), and 
  – NTPP(x, z) (if x ⊆ z entirely in the interior of z).

There are no other possibilities given the constraints.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).
