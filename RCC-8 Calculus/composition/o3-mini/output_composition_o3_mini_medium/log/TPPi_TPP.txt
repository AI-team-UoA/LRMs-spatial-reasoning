PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two premises:

 • TPPi(x, y) (which, by definition, is equivalent to TPP(y, x) – that is, y is a tangential proper part of x)
 • TPP(y, z) (which says that y is a tangential proper part of z)

So we have y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z with y touching the boundary of the container region in each case.

Now, knowing that y is contained in both x and z, we cannot have x and z be disconnected (DC) or merely externally connected (EC) – they must overlap (in fact, they share at least y’s interior). Moreover, since both TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z) are strict (proper‐part) relations, it cannot be that x = z.

There are two basic ways in which two regions having a common (proper) part may be arranged:

1. One of them might include the other. For example, x might be entirely contained in z. In that case, x would be a proper part of z. But then the “touching of the boundary” property may or may not be inherited. In other words, x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x, z)) or a non‐tangential proper part (NTPP(x, z)). Likewise, it is also possible that z is contained in x, yielding TPPi(x, z) (i.e. TPP(z, x)) or NTPPi(x, z).

2. Or, neither region is contained in the other; then they simply overlap (PO) since they share at least the part y but also extend outside y differently.

Thus, the possible RCC‑8 relations between x and z are:

 • Either one is a proper part of the other, which may be either tangential or non‐tangential. That is, either
  – x is a proper part of z (TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z))
  – or z is a proper part of x (i.e. TPPi(x, z) or NTPPi(x, z)).

 • Or neither contains the other and they merely overlap (PO).

In summary, if TPPi(x, y) and TPP(y, z) hold, the possible relations between x and z are:

 PO, TPP(x, z), NTPP(x, z), TPPi(x, z) (equivalently, TPP(z, x)), and NTPPi(x, z) (equivalently, NTPP(z, x)).

### Answer: PO, TPP(x, z), NTPP(x, z), TPPi(x, z), and NTPPi(x, z)
