PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We begin with the two given facts:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not touch y’s boundary (i.e. x lies entirely in the interior of y).
2. PO(y,z): y and z overlap (they share some interior, yet neither is a subset of the other; in particular, y has parts inside and parts outside z).

Because x is (non‐tangentially) inside y, there is some freedom in how x may lie within y relative to the overlapping situation of y and z. In different geometric arrangements the relationship between x and z can come out differently. For example:

• It is possible that x lies entirely in the part of y that is outside z. In that case x and z do not overlap at all (and even their boundaries need not contact) – so x and z would be DC (Disconnected).

• It is also possible that x is placed so that while it is wholly within y, it abuts the portion of y that lies in z. Then x might externally touch z (EC).

• Another possibility is that x is positioned so that part of it falls inside z and part outside. Then x and z share some (but not all) interior, yielding PO (Partial Overlap).

• Yet x might lie entirely within the part of y that overlaps z. In that case x is a proper subset of z. Depending on whether x touches z’s boundary or not one may have x TPP z (Tangential Proper Part) if x touches the boundary of z, or x NTPP z (Non‐Tangential Proper Part) if it lies strictly in the interior of z.

Thus, depending on the particular arrangement, the possible RCC‑8 base relations between x and z are:

  DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.
