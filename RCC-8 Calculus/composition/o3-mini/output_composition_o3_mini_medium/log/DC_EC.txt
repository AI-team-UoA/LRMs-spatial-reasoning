PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the facts that

 • DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (their closures do not meet), and

 • EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (their boundaries meet but their interiors do not).

Now, what can we say about the relation between x and z? In a picture one may imagine y as an “obstacle” that is not touched by x at all, while z “just touches” y (along y’s boundary). But z may be placed arbitrarily relative to x except for the following restriction: because y touches z, any arrangement in which x “contains” z (so that z is a proper part of x) would force x and y to come in contact through z. In other words, x cannot be so large as to envelop z.

A number of qualitative spatial configurations are possible. For example, one may have:
1. x located far from z, so that x and z are disconnected (DC(x,z)).
2. x “just reaching” z (touching its boundary but not overlapping), so that x and z are externally connected (EC(x,z)).
3. x and z might “partially overlap” (PO(x,z)).
4. x may lie entirely within z. In that case x is a proper part of z. If x touches the boundary of z then we have TPP(x,z) (“tangential proper part”), and if not then NTPP(x,z) (“non‐tangential proper part”). (Note that the inverse relations TPPi and NTPPi – where z is a proper part of x – are ruled out because then z ⊆ x would force x to “capture” the spot where y touches z, contradicting DC(x,y).)

Thus, given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) the possible RCC–8 relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
