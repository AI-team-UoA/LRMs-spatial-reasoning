PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the following known facts:

1. PO(x,y) means that x and y have a non‐empty overlap of their interiors, but neither is completely contained in the other.
2. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch along their boundaries, but their interiors do not intersect.

Let us look at how x can relate to z:

• Decompose x into two parts: one part that is inside y (call it x₁ = x ∩ y) and one part that lies outside y (x₂ = x ∖ y). Note that since x is not contained in y (because of PO), x₂ is nonempty.

• Since y and z are externally connected (EC), none of the interior of y (and thus x₁ ⊆ y) will lie inside the interior of z (they might only touch the boundary of z). However, the part x₂, which is outside y, is “free” to be located with respect to z.

Now, depending on how x₂ is positioned relative to z we can have three possibilities for the relation between x and z:

1. If the part x₂ is located away from z, then none of x touches z. In that case x and z are Disconnected (DC).

2. If x₂ (or possibly even some x₁) is situated exactly so that it touches the boundary of z (and no interior point of z is shared), then x and z are Externally Connected (EC).

3. If x₂ goes far enough into the interior of z so that the two share interior points, then x and z partially overlap (PO).

There are no other possibilities (e.g. one cannot be a proper part of the other) because the given constraints (PO and EC) prevent any full inclusion.

Thus the possible RCC‑8 relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
  DC, EC, and PO.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO
