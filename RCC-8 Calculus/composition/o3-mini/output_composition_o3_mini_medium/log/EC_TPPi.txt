PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that

  EC(x,y)       (x touches y at the boundary but shares no interior)
  TPPi(y,z), which by definition is the same as TPP(z,y).

Since TPP(z,y) means that z is a proper part of y and z touches y’s boundary, we know that:

  1. z is contained in y (z ⊆ y),
  2. z touches y’s boundary.

At the same time, EC(x,y) tells us that x does not share interior points with y (and hence with any region whose interior lies in y), though x does have a non‐empty contact (through the boundaries) with y.

Now, consider x and z. Since z ⊆ y, the interior of z (int(z)) is a subset of the interior of y. Because x and y are externally connected, we have

  x ∩ int(y) = ∅   thus x ∩ int(z) = ∅.

This rules out any possibility of x sharing interior points with z (so relations like PO, TPP, etc. are not possible).

However, since both x and z touch y’s boundary (x does so because it is EC with y and z does so because it is a tangential part of y), it is possible that x and z share a point on the boundary of y. In that situation x and z would be EC. On the other hand, if the part of y’s boundary where x touches y is different from the part where z touches y, then x and z might not contact each other at all—in which case they are disconnected (DC).

Thus, the only possible RCC‑8 relations between x and z given these constraints are:

  DC(x,z)  or  EC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z)
