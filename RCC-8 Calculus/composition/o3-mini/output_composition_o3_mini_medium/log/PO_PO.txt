PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the definitions. Recall that

• PO(x,y) means that x and y share some interior but neither is a subset (or proper part) of the other.

Now suppose that
  PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Because PO only tells us that x and y (and similarly y and z) share some interior region, there is considerable freedom in how the three regions can be arranged. In particular, depending on how the common parts and the “external” parts of x, y, and z are arranged, x and z might be:

• Disconnected (DC): It is possible to have x and z “come in contact” with y in different parts so that x and z end up with no common parts and no touching boundaries.

• Externally connected (EC): The region x might touch z at the boundary even though their interiors do not overlap.

• Partially overlapping (PO): x and z might share some common interior (without one being inside the other).

• In a proper‐part relation: It is also possible to arrange things so that one of x or z is (tangentially or non‐tangentially) a proper part of the other. That is, we could have either
  TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
or, reversing the roles,
  TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, all the possible RCC‐8 relationships between x and z that are consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi.
