PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since TPP(x, y) means that x is a proper part of y (with x touching yâ€™s boundary) and DC(y, z) means that y and z have no points in common (not even on their boundaries), it follows that every point of x is contained in y and hence cannot get in contact with any point of z. Even if x touches the boundary of y, no point of that boundary can touch z because y is completely separated from z. Therefore, x and z must also be disconnected.
