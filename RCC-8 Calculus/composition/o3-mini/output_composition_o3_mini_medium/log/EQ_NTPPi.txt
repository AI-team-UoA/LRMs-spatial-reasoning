PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that EQ(x, y) (meaning x and y are identical) and NTPPi(y, z). Recall that by definition, NTPPi(y, z) means the same as NTPP(z, y) (i.e. z is a non‐tangential proper part of y, meaning z is contained in y, does not touch y’s boundary, and z ≠ y). Since EQ(x, y) tells us that x and y are the same region, we can substitute x for y in the second relation. Thus, NTPP(z, y) becomes NTPP(z, x).

Now, by the symmetry of the proper part relations, NTPP(z, x) is equivalent to saying x is in the inverse relation NTPPi(x, z). (Recall that NTPPi(x, z) is defined as NTPP(z, x).)

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z under these conditions is that:
  x NTPPi z

In the required answer format:

### Answer: x NTPPi z
