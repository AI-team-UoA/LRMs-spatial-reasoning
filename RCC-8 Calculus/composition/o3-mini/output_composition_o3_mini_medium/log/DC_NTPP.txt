PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that x and y are disconnected (DC) and that y is a non‐tangent proper part of z (NTPP). (Recall that NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and even its closure does not touch z’s boundary.) The question is: what are the possible RCC-8 relations that x can bear to z?

The idea is to “chain” the two relations. Since y is fully contained (and even not touching the boundary) its container z, any spatial relation between x and z must be compatible with the fact that x is disjoint from y. Think of y as a “middle” region that lies in the interior of z; then x, being disjoint from y, may be found in one of several positions relative to z:

1. x may lie completely outside z. Then x and z have no common parts at all – that is, x and z are disconnected (DC).

2. x may touch the boundary of z but, by careful positioning, still be disjoint from the interior region y. Then x and z are externally connected (EC).

3. x may overlap z in such a way that x’s intersection with z avoids y (for instance, if z is large and x overlaps only the outer “ring” of z). In that case the two regions share some spatial parts, but neither contains the other – meaning they are in a partial overlap relation (PO).

Other RCC-8 relations (such as one region being a proper part of the other, EQ, etc.) would force x to lie entirely inside or coincide with z, which would not be forced by the given constraints and might risk a contact with y unless extra separation were assumed.

Thus, based solely on DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the permissible relations between x and z are:
  DC, EC, or PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO
