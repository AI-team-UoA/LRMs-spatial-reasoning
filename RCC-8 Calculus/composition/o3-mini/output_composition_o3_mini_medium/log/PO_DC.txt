PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that x and y are in the PO (partially overlapping) relation; that is, they share some but not all parts, and neither is completely contained in the other. We are also told that y and z are in the DC (disconnected) relation, meaning they have no points in common.

Because x partly overlaps y, some of x lies inside y while some lies outside y. However, since y and z share no points, the portion of x that is inside y cannot be related in any “touching” or “overlapping” way with z. On the other hand, the portion of x outside y may have an arbitrary relationship with z. In particular, depending on how that part of x is arranged relative to z, one of three possibilities may hold between x and z:

• DC (Disconnected): It is possible that the part of x outside y does not meet z at all, so that x and z have no points in common.

• EC (Externally Connected): It is also possible that the remaining part of x touches z (for example, they share just a boundary) without overlapping in any interior parts.

• PO (Partially Overlapping): Finally, x and z might share some interior portion (from the part of x that lies outside y) but not in a way that makes one a subset of the other.

Other RCC‑8 relations like TPP, NTPP, or EQ are ruled out because they would force a containment or coincidence that contradicts the fact that x overlaps y (and part of x lies within y, while y is totally disjoint from z).

Thus, the only three possible spatial relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, and PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, and PO.
