PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the assumptions:

1. PO(x,y) means that x and y “partially overlap.” In particular, x and y have a non‐empty intersection but neither is contained in the other.

2. TPPi(y,z) is defined as being the inverse of TPP. (Since TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), TPPi(y,z) tells us that y is a tangential proper part of z; that is, y ⊊ z and y touches z’s boundary.)

Now, because y is (tangentially) contained in z, every point of y is also in z. (Note that a tangential proper part may “touch” the boundary, but we still have y ⊆ z.)

Given that x overlaps y (and thus x has some points in common with y) it follows that x must share at least those points with z (since y ⊆ z). However, the fact that x and y do not have a containment relation leaves open a number of possibilities for how x might lie with respect to z. In particular:

• It is possible that x is entirely contained in z. Then the relation between x and z is one of containment. In RCC‐8 (for proper parts) there are two possibilities:
 – Either x touches z’s boundary, in which case x TPP z, or
 – x lies entirely in the interior of z (no boundary contact) making x NTPP z.

• It is also possible that x extends partly outside z. In that case x meets z (since it meets y ⊆ z) but is not completely inside z. Hence, x and z would “overlap” (neither is contained in the other). That is, they are in the PO relation.

• Finally, it is possible that x “engulfs” z. (That is, x extends so far that it actually contains z. Notice that z still meets x because y ⊆ z.) In that case z is a proper part of x. By our definitions, the proper‐part relation “inverses” (TPPi or NTPPi) so that x and z are in relation
 – TPPi (if z touches the boundary of x) or
 – NTPPi (if z lies entirely in the interior of x).

Thus, the only possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z, given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are those in which x and z either overlap (PO) or one is a proper part of the other. In the latter case we may have either (depending on whether the interior contacts a boundary or not) TPP or NTPP (when x ⊆ z) or, dually, TPPi or NTPPi (when z ⊆ x).

So the final answer is that x and z can be in any one of the following RCC‐8 relations:
 PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.
