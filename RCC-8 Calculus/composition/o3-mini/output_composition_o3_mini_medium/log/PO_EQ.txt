PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part but neither is a subset of the other, and EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical, we can substitute z for y. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is the same as the relationship between x and y. That is, x and z also share a spatial part but neither is contained in the other. 

### Answer: PO(x,z)
