PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the following assumptions:
 • EC(x,y) means that x and y touch, but none of x’s (or y’s) interior is shared with y (or x).
 • PO(y,z) means that y and z partly overlap (i.e. they share some, but not all, part of their interiors; neither contains the other).

Our goal is to determine all the possible RCC‑8 relations that might hold between x and z.

Let us look at possible configurations:

1. x and y are externally connected. In other words, they share a boundary but have no common interior.
2. y and z partially overlap. So y and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.

Given these two pieces of information, one can “compose” the two pieces of information to ask how x and z may relate. Notice that y “mediates” the relation between x and z, and different spatial configurations yield different relations between x and z. For example:

• It is possible to have x and z be completely separate (no touching at all). For instance, if z overlaps y in a region that is “far” from the point where x touches y, then x and z will be disconnected. This gives DC(x,z).

• It is also possible that z “reaches” toward x. In some arrangements the overlapping part of y with z may occur right at the point where x abuts y so that the boundary of x will meet the boundary or even a little of the interior of z. In such cases the only contact between x and z is along their boundaries, so we have EC(x,z).

• Another possibility is that z “extends” into the region near x so that x and z share some interior. Then x and z would overlap (PO(x,z)).

• In some configurations x can in fact be entirely “swallowed” by z. That is, it is possible for x to lie entirely inside z. (Because x’s only contact with y can be arranged, say, to occur at an isolated portion of its boundary.) In that case we need to decide whether x touches the boundary of z or lies strictly in its interior.
 – If x touches the boundary of z then x is a proper part of z that touches its border (TPP(x,z)).
 – If x lies entirely in the interior of z then we have NTPP(x,z).

Note that the “dual” situation in which z is a proper part of x is not possible here because if z were entirely contained in x then x and y (which are externally connected) would have to share at least some interior parts (via z) in order for y and z to be overlapping, and this would contradict x and y being EC.

Thus, by considering various placements of the regions that satisfy EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), we find that x and z may be related by any of the following RCC‑8 relations:
 DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.
