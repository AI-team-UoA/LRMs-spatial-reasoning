PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x, y) (meaning x is a non‐tangential proper part of y) and EQ(y, z) (meaning y and z are identical), we substitute z for y in the first relation to obtain that x is a non‐tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x, z).

### Answer: NTPP(x, z)
