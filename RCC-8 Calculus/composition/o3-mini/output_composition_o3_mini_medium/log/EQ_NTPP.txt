PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(x, y) means that x and y are exactly the same, we can substitute x for y in the relation NTPP(y, z). This substitution gives us NTPP(x, z). Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is that x is a non‚Äêtangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x, z)
