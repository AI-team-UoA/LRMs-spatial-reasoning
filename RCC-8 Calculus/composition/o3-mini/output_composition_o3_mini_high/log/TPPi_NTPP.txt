PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the meanings of the given relations:
 • TPP(x,y) means “x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary.”
 • TPPi(x,y) is defined as TPP(y,x) (that is, it is the converse of TPP).
 • NTPP(x,y) means “x is a proper part of y but does not touch y’s boundary.”

The two conditions are:

1. TPPi(x,y): This is equivalent to TPP(y,x). So y is a (tangential) proper part of x (y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of x).

2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non‐tangential proper part of z (y ⊂ z and y does not touch the boundary of z).

Since y is a part of both x and z, x and z must share at least the region y. However, there are several ways that x and z can be arranged relative to each other. In particular, there are three possibilities:

A. x is entirely contained in z. In that case, x ⊆ z. But there are two subcases:
 • x may “touch” the boundary of z (x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e. TPP(x,z));
 • or x may lie entirely in the interior of z (so x is a non‐tangential proper part of z, i.e. NTPP(x,z)).
Both are allowed because it is possible to arrange the regions so that even though y touches the boundary of x, it still remains away from the boundary of z.

B. x is not completely contained in z (and likewise z is not contained in x). Since y ⊆ x ∩ z, the two regions do overlap but neither is a proper subset of the other. This is the RCC–8 relation PO (partial overlap).

Note that x cannot contain z (or be equal to z) because if z were a proper part of x then y, being inside z as well as touching x’s boundary, would force y to also meet (a part of) x that is not inside z—which would contradict the fact that y is wholly a part of z.

Thus, the only possible RCC–8 relations between x and z are:
 • TPP(x,z)
 • NTPP(x,z)
 • PO(x,z)

These are all the possible answers.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and PO(x,z).
