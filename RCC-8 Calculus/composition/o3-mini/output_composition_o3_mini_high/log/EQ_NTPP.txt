PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical (coincident), any spatial relation that holds for y will also hold for x. Since NTPP(y,z) stipulates that y is a non‐tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z’s boundary), it immediately follows that x, being equal to y, is a non‐tangential proper part of z as well.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
