PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Let’s begin by recalling the definitions:

• EC(x, y): x and y are externally connected. They touch at a boundary but their interiors do not overlap.

• NTPP(x, y): x is a non‐tangential proper part of y, meaning x ⊆ interior(y).

• NTPPi(x, y) is defined as the inverse of NTPP, so NTPPi(y, z) is the same as NTPP(z, y). In other words, z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (z ⊆ interior(y)).

Now, we are given that:
  EC(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z) (i.e. NTPP(z, y)).

Since x and y are externally connected (EC), x touches y only at y’s boundary and does not penetrate its interior. Meanwhile, since z is a non‐tangential proper part of y, z lies entirely within the interior of y; its closure does not reach y’s boundary.

Therefore, any point in z (or even on its boundary) lies in the interior of y, which is separated from the boundary of y – the only place where x “meets” y. Consequently, x cannot share any boundary or interior points with z.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is that they are disconnected (DC).
