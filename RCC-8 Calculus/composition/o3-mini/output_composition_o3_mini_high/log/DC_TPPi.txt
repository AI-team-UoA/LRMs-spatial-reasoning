PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that DC(x,y) holds, which means that x and y have no parts in common at all. Also, we are told that TPPi(y,z) holds. By the definition given, TPPi(a,b) is the same as TPP(b,a), so TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y). And TPP(z,y) means that z is a tangential proper part of y; that is, z is contained in y (z ⊆ y) and its boundary touches y’s boundary.

Now, since z is entirely contained within y and x and y have no overlap (they are disconnected), it follows that x cannot overlap or even touch z. (Any common point between x and z would automatically be a point of y because z ⊆ y, contradicting that x and y are disconnected.)

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is DC.
