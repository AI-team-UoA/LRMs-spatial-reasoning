PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start by noting the definitions:

• TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and x’s boundary touches y’s boundary.
• PO(y,z) means that y and z share some part of their interiors, yet neither is a proper subset of the other.

Since x is a proper part of y, and y overlaps z only partially, there are several ways x can be arranged relative to z. In particular, consider these three schematic cases:

1. x lies entirely in the part of y that is outside z. Then x and z do not share any points. Depending on how the boundaries are arranged, x and z may either be completely disconnected (DC) or they may touch at a boundary (EC).

2. x lies entirely in the part of y that is inside z (so that x ⊆ z). In this situation, x becomes a proper part of z. Depending on whether x touches z’s boundary or lies completely inside z’s interior, the relation will be either TPP (if x touches z’s boundary) or NTPP (if x is entirely interior to z).

3. x overlaps the boundary between the y‑portion that lies in z and that which lies outside z. In this case, x and z share some but not all parts of x—that is, x is partially inside and partially outside z. Here the relation between x and z is PO.

Thus, the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:
  DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.
