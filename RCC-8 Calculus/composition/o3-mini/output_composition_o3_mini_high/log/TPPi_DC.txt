PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two given conditions:

 • TPPi(x,y) (by definition, this is equivalent to TPP(y,x)) says that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained in x (y ⊂ x) and at least one point of y’s boundary is also a boundary point of x.

 • DC(y,z) tells us that y and z are disconnected (they share no points at all, not even a boundary point).

Now, because y ⊆ x, the fact that y is disjoint from z gives us only a restriction on the part of x “occupied” by y; it does not force any fixed relation between x and z. In fact, z may be arranged relative to x in several ways that still keep it disjoint from y. For example, one may have:

1. x and z are entirely separate (DC): x and z do not meet at all. Since y ⊆ x, it is clear that y cannot touch z.
2. x and z meet only at a boundary (EC): here, x and z share some boundary points. It is then possible for y (which touches the boundary of x) to be placed on a different portion of the x‐boundary so that y and z remain separated.
3. x and z share an overlapping region (PO): x and z may have intersecting interiors, while y (a part of x) happens to lie in a region of x that z does not touch.
4. z may lie entirely inside x. In such a case, from the perspective of x and z one of the following proper‐part relations holds:
  a. TPPi(x,z): meaning that z is a tangential proper part of x (z ⊆ x and z touches x’s boundary),
  b. NTPPi(x,z): meaning that z is a non–tangential proper part of x (z ⊆ x but does not touch x’s boundary).

Note that if instead x were a proper part of z, then we would have y ⊆ x ⊆ z and so y and z would not be disconnected. Similarly, x cannot equal z.

Thus, the only possibilities for the relationship between x and z (from the eight RCC-8 relations) are:

 DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z)
