PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the definitions:

• EC(x, y) means x and y touch at a boundary point but their interiors do not intersect.
• TPP(x, y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary.
• TPPi(x, y) is simply the inverse of TPP, so TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y) – that is, z is a tangential proper part of y.

Thus, TPPi(y, z) tells us that z is contained in y (z ⊆ y), is not equal to y, and touches the boundary of y.

Now, because x is externally connected to y (EC(x, y)), x lies outside y except that it touches y’s boundary at one or more points. Meanwhile, since z ⊆ y, its interior lies within the interior of y. In standard well‐behaved regions (as assumed in RCC-8), if x were to share an interior point with z then x’s interior would lie in y, contradicting x EC y. Hence, x and z cannot have any overlapping interior parts.

Now consider the possibilities:
1. If the point (or points) at which x touches y happens not to be where z touches y, then x and z are completely separate—i.e. they are disconnected (DC(x, z)).
2. On the other hand, if that same part of y’s boundary (where x touches y) is also the part where z touches y, then x and z will also touch but not overlap in their interiors. In this case the relationship is EC(x, z).

Since these are the only possibilities, the answer is that x and z are either disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC).

### Answer: DC(x, z) and EC(x, z)
