PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)) and y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)). In RCC‐8 the relation DC means that two regions share no point (no common boundary or interior), but note that these constraints only tell us about how x relates to y and how y relates to z—they do not constrain the direct relationship between x and z at all. 

In fact, one can easily imagine examples where x and z are:

• Clearly separated (DC),
• Just touching (EC),
• Overlapping (PO),
• In a proper part relationship in either order (TPP or its inverse TPPi, or the non‐tangential versions NTPP or NTPPi),
• Even identical (EQ).

Thus, from DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) nothing is forced about the relation between x and z. Any of the eight RCC‐8 relations is possible.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.
