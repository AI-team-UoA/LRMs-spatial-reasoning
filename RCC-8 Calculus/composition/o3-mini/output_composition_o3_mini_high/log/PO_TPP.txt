PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that x partially overlaps y, written as PO(x,y), and that y is a tangential proper part of z, written as TPP(y,z). Recall the key points for these relations:

• PO(x,y) means that x and y share some interior but neither is completely contained in the other.
• TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z (so y ⊆ z) and y touches z’s boundary.

Now, because y ⊆ z, any point in x that lies in y is inside z. However, x may not be entirely inside z; it may “spill out” of z or it may lie completely within z.

There are two cases:

1. If all of x is inside z (i.e. x ⊆ z), then x is a proper part of z. In RCC‑8 there are two possibilities:
  • x may touch the boundary of z, giving TPP(x,z)
  • x may not touch the boundary of z, giving NTPP(x,z)

2. If x is not entirely contained in z (so part of x lies outside z), then while x and z do intersect (because x meets y ⊆ z), x is not a subset of z. In this case, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

Thus, depending on the exact placement of x relative to z, x and z can be in one of the following RCC‑8 relations: PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: PO, TPP, and NTPP
