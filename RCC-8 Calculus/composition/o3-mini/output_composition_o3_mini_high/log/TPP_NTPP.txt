PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that x TPP y we know that x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary. Also, y NTPP z tells us that y is a proper part of z and, crucially, y does not touch z’s boundary (i.e. y is entirely contained within the interior of z).

Because x is a subset of y and y lies completely in the interior of z, every point of x (and even its boundary) must also lie in the interior of z. That is, x cannot be "touching" the boundary of z. In RCC‑8 terms, this means that x is a non‐tangential proper part of z, written as NTPP(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z in this scenario is:

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
