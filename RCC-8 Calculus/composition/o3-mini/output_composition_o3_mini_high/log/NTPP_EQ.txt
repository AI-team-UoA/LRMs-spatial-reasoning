PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical, we can substitute z for y in the relation NTPP(x,y). Therefore, NTPP(x,y) implies NTPP(x,z).

In other words, x is a non-tangential proper part of y. Since y equals z, x is also a non-tangential proper part of z. There is no other possibility.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
