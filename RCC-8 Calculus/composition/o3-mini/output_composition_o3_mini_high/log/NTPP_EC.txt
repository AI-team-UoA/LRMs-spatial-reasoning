PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the assumptions:

1. NTPP(x, y): x is a non‐tangential proper part of y. This means that x is entirely contained in y and, more importantly, x does not touch y’s boundary (i.e. the closure of x is wholly contained in the interior of y).

2. EC(y, z): y is externally connected to z. This means that y and z “touch” each other at their boundaries, but their interiors do not overlap.

Now, because x is a non‐tangential proper part of y, every point of x (and even points in its closure) is in the interior of y. Since y’s interior is disjoint from z’s interior (by the definition of EC), there is no way for x, which lies inside y away from its boundary, to have any contact with z. Thus, x and z do not share any points (not even at a boundary).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is that they are disconnected: DC(x, z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
