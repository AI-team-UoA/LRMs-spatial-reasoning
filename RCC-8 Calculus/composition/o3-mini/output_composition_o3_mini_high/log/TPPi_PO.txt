PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two facts:

1. TPPi(x,y) is by definition the same as TPP(y,x). So TPPi(x,y) tells us that y is a tangential proper part of x—that is, y is entirely contained inside x (y ⊆ x) and at least one point of y’s boundary coincides with a point on x’s boundary.

2. PO(y,z) means that y and z have a non‐empty overlapping interior but neither is contained in the other.

Now, since y ⊆ x, any intersection between y and z ensures that x and z must overlap (so x and z cannot be disconnected (DC) or merely externally connected (EC)). However, the placement of z relative to x can happen in one of two general ways:

A. z is entirely contained in x. In this case x and z are in a containment relationship. But because PO(y,z) holds (so neither y ⊆ z nor z ⊆ y), z must not coincide exactly with y. Also, since we have no information about whether z touches the boundary of x, two sub‐cases arise:
  • If z touches the boundary of x then y ⊆ z ⊆ x and x and z stand in the tangential proper part relation (in the converse direction, we write this as TPPi(x,z)).
  • If z does not touch the boundary of x (i.e. it lies entirely in the interior of x) then the relation is the non‐tangential proper part converse, NTPPi(x,z).

B. z is not completely contained in x. In this case, z overlaps with x (since y ⊆ x ⊆ x ∩ z, and y ∩ z≠∅) but also has parts outside x, so neither x ⊆ z nor z ⊆ x holds. This is exactly the PO relation between x and z.

Thus, depending on how z is positioned relative to x, the possible RCC–8 relations between x and z are either:

– PO(x,z) (if z is not a subset of x), or
– TPPi(x,z) (if z ⊆ x and touches x’s boundary), or
– NTPPi(x,z) (if z ⊆ x but does not touch x’s boundary).

### Answer: PO, TPPi, and NTPPi
