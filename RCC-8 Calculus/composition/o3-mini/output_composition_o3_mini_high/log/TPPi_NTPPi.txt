PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given facts written in “inverse‐notation”:

 • TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): that is, y is a tangential proper part of x (y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of x).  
 • NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y): that is, z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (z ⊂ y and the closure of z is contained in the interior of y).

Since z ⊂ y and y ⊂ x, by transitivity we have z ⊂ x. The key point now is whether z touches x’s boundary or not.

Because z is a non‐tangential proper part of y, the closure of z lies entirely in the interior of y. But remember that although y itself touches x’s boundary (since y TPP x), every point in the interior of y has a small open neighborhood completely inside y (and hence inside x). In other words, the fact that y touches x’s boundary does not “force” z (which is well inside y) to reach the boundary of x. In fact, one can show that the interior of y is contained in the interior of x. (Any point p in the interior of y has an open ball B(p,ε) ⊆ y, and since y ⊆ x, B(p,ε) ⊆ x; so p cannot lie on the boundary of x.) 

Thus the closure of z (being contained in the interior of y) is also contained in the interior of x. This tells us that z does not touch x’s boundary. In RCC‐8 terms, this means that, although z is a proper part of x, it is “well inside” x; that is, z is a non–tangential proper part of x.

Using the inverse‐notation (which places the container first) we express “z is a non–tangential proper part of x” as

  NTPPi(x,z).

So the only possible relation between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), is

  NTPPi(x,z).

That is, x “contains” z non–tangentially (or equivalently, z is a non–tangential proper part of x).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
