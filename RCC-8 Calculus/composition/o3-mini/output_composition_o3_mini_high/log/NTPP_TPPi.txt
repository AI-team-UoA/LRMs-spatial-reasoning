PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the information that

  • NTPP(x,y) means “x is a non‐tangential proper part of y” (so x is contained well “inside” y, not touching y’s boundary), and

  • TPPi(y,z) means “TPP(z,y)” (by the definition that TPPi is just the converse of TPP). In other words, z is a tangential proper part of y (so z is contained in y but does touch y’s boundary).

Thus both x and z lie inside y. Moreover, x is “safely inside” (its closure lies in the interior of y) while z “reaches out” to y’s boundary.

Now consider what may happen to the relative position of x and z. Since they are both inside y there is no further “external” connection with y to force a unique relationship; rather, the geometric placement of x within the interior of y and of z (which extends to y’s boundary) may allow several possibilities. For example, one may have:

1. x is entirely inside z (that is, x ⊆ z). But even in that case the way x meets the boundary of z is not fixed: x might lie completely in the interior of z (so that x is a non‐tangential proper part of z, NTPP(x,z)) or it might “touch” the part of z’s boundary (so that x is a tangential proper part of z, TPP(x,z)).

2. x and z may overlap partly without one including the other (that is, they share some common part, but neither is a subset of the other). In RCC‐8 this is the PO (“partial overlap”) relation.

3. It is also possible that x and z are arranged in different regions of y so that they do not meet at all, i.e. they are disconnected (DC).

4. Or they may “just touch” along a boundary (that is, their interiors are disjoint but their boundaries meet), which is the EC relation.

Note that the other RCC‐8 relations (EQ, TPPi (which is just TPP in the converse order), and NTPPi) cannot occur because:
  – EQ would require x and z to be identical (which cannot be, since x lies entirely in the interior of y while z “reaches” y’s boundary), and
  – z cannot be a proper part of x (which would violate the “margin” of x inside y).

Thus the only possibilities for the relation between x and z are:
  • DC (disconnected),
  • EC (externally connected),
  • PO (partial overlap),
  • TPP (x is a tangential proper part of z), or
  • NTPP (x is a non‐tangential proper part of z).

Expressing the final answer in the required format:

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.
