PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the definitions:

• EC(x,y): x and y share a boundary but no interior.  
• PO(y,z): y and z share some interior but neither is a subset of the other.

Now, imagine you have three regions x, y, and z with the following constraints:
– x touches y at its boundary (EC).  
– y and z overlap (PO), so part of y’s interior is in z and vice‐versa.

Because y overlaps z, z must extend partly outside y. Since x merely “kisses” y, the way z is placed relative to x can vary. For example:
• If the portion of z that lies outside y is far away from x, then x and z have no contact (DC).  
• If that portion just reaches x, then x and z may touch at a boundary (EC).  
• They can also be arranged so that z “cuts into” x’s area, producing a partial overlap (PO).  
• Moreover, it is possible to have x completely inside z. In that case x is a proper part of z; depending on whether x touches z’s boundary or not, the relation is TPP (touching) or NTPP (non‐touching).

One cannot have z ⊆ x (the converse proper‐part relation) because then the interior of z would lie inside x and x (being EC with y) does not have interior in common with y—this would contradict y PO z.

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
