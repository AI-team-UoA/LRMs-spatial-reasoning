PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given facts:

1. PO(x,y) means that x and y share some (but not all) interior, so neither is a proper part of the other.
2. TPPi(y,z), by definition, is equivalent to TPP(z,y). This tells us that z is a tangential proper part of y—that is, z is entirely contained in y and touches y’s boundary.

Now, since z ⊆ y and x overlaps y (but x is not contained in y), the way x and z can relate depends on how x “interacts” with the part of y that contains z. Let’s examine the various possible spatial placements:

• Case 1: x’s overlap with y does not “reach” z at all. Then x and z may be completely separated (DC) or they might just touch at their boundaries (EC).

• Case 2: x and z have an intersection but neither contains the other. Then x and z partially overlap (PO).

• Case 3: The portion of x that lies inside y happens to completely cover z. In that case z is a proper part of x. However, note that since x extends beyond y, x cannot be a subset of y (which is why x and y are PO). In the relation between x and z, since z is properly contained in x and may either touch x’s boundary or not, the possible relations are the proper‐containment ones—namely, TPPi (if z touches the boundary of x) or NTPPi (if it does not).

There is no possibility for EQ (equality) nor for x to be a proper part of z because of the way these regions are arranged.

Thus, the possible RCC‑8 relations between x and z are:
 DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z)
