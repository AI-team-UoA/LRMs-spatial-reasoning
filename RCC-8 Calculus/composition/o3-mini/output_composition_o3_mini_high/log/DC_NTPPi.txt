PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the definitions:

• DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected (i.e. they share no point – not even on their boundaries).  
• NTPPi(y,z) is defined as “NTPP(z,y)” (it is the inverse of NTPP), meaning that z is a non‐tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is entirely inside y (its closure is a subset of the interior of y, so z does not reach y’s boundary).

Now, assume:
  1. x and y are disconnected, so no point of x lies in y.  
  2. z is completely contained inside y (and “well inside” it, since it does not touch y’s boundary).

Because every point of z lies inside y, if x were to have any kind of contact (or overlap) with z the same point of contact would lie inside y. That would force x to contact y, contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus there is no possibility for x and z to be touching (EC) or overlapping (PO) or one being a proper part of the other (TPP, NTPP, etc.). The only available relation is that x and z are also disconnected (DC).
