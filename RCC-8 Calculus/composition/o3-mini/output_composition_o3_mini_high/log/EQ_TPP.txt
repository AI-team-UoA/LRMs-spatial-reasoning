PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical, the relation TPP(y,z) (y is a tangential proper part of z) directly transfers to x. That is, x is the same as y and thus x is a tangential proper part of z. 

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
