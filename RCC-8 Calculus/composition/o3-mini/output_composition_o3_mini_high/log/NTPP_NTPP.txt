PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y’s boundary, and NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and does not touch z’s boundary, we can argue as follows:

1. Since x is non‐tangentially contained in y, x lies entirely within the interior of y.
2. Similarly, y lies entirely within the interior of z.
3. Therefore, x, being completely inside the interior of y, must also lie entirely inside the interior of z.
4. This shows that x is a proper part of z and its boundary does not touch the boundary of z.

In other words, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
