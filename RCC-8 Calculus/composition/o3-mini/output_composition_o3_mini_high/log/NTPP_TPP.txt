PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that x NTPP y (x is a non‐tangential proper part of y, meaning x is inside the interior of y) and y TPP z (y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is inside z but touches z’s boundary), we know that x is a proper part of z. However, because y touches the boundary of z, the embedded region x (which lies in the interior of y) may or may not also reach z’s boundary.

Specifically, there are two cases:
1. If x is chosen so that it stays well away from the part of y that touches z’s boundary, then x will lie entirely within the interior of z. In this case, x is a non‐tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).
2. If x is chosen so that it is very near the part of y that touches z’s boundary, then x may come into contact with the boundary of z. In that situation, x is only a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z)
