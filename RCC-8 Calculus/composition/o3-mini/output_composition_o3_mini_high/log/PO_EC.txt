PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with

 • PO(x,y): x and y overlap (their interiors intersect), yet neither is a subset of the other

 • EC(y,z): y and z “touch” (their boundaries meet) but their interiors do not intersect

Now, let us ask what kinds of spatial relationships may occur between x and z. Intuitively, one may imagine situations such as the following:

1. x meets y “far away” from the part where y touches z. In that case, x might have no contact with z at all – so x and z are Disconnected (DC).

2. x might “reach out” (via its part that overlaps y) to the border of y where z is attached. Then x and z simply touch (share a common boundary but no interior) – making them Externally Connected (EC).

3. Alternatively, x might extend far enough so that some of its interior “invades” into z’s interior. Then x and z will share an interior portion and are said to Partially Overlap (PO).

4. There is also the possibility that x is “big” and, besides overlapping y, actually contains z. (Note that it cannot be that x is itself contained in z because then the x–y overlap would lie on the mere boundary of y, contradicting PO(x,y).) Thus one may have z ⊆ x. In the RCC‐8 repertoire this containment can occur in two flavors:
  a. If z touches the boundary of x then the relation is the “converse” of TPP, usually written TPPi.
  b. If z lies entirely in the interior of x then x and z are in the NTPPi relation.

So, all together, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) the RCC‑8 relation between x and z may be any one of:

 • DC, • EC, • PO, • TPPi, or • NTPPi.

Thus, the final answer is as follows:

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
