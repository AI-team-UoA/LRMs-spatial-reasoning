PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given facts:

  EC(x,y) means that x touches y (they have a boundary in common, but do not share interior points), and  
  DC(y,z) means that y and z do not touch at all (they are separated).

Now, consider what might happen with x and z. Even though x touches y, nothing forces x to lie entirely near y. In fact, x might extend well away from y so that its “other parts” may be quite remote or even overlapping with z. We can imagine three prototypical cases:

1. x is situated so that its part that touches y is the only near part, and the remainder of x is far from z. In that case x and z will be completely separated – that is, DC(x,z).

2. x is shaped so that while it touches y, another part of x reaches far enough to “just touch” z (without overlapping interiors). Then x and z are externally connected – EC(x,z).

3. x might extend in such a way that although it touches y along one edge, it also has a large portion overlapping with z. Then x and z share a spatial part (but neither is contained in the other), which is exactly the PO relation.

Note that containment relations (TPP, NTPP, etc.) or equality (EQ) are ruled out by the constraints: if x were entirely inside or equal to z, then the fact that x touches y (and y is separated from z) would lead to a contradiction.

Thus, the only possible spatial relations between x and z (given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z)) are:

  DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and PO(x,z).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO
