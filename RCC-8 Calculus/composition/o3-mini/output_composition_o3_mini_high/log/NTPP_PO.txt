PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the following assumptions:

• NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and lies completely in the interior of y (so x does not touch y’s boundary).

• PO(y,z) means that y and z have overlapping interiors but neither is contained in the other; that is, y has some parts inside z and some parts outside z.

Since x is (non‐tangentially) inside y, the relation between x and z depends on where within y the region x lies relative to the overlap of y and z. There are several possibilities:

1. x may lie entirely in the portion of y that falls outside of z. In that case x and z have no points in common. Depending on whether x actually touches the boundary of z or not, the relation can be either
  • DC(x,z) (if there is a gap) or
  • EC(x,z) (if x touches z at its boundary even though x is not inside z).

2. x may lie partly in the part of y that overlaps with z and partly in the part that does not. Then x has some interior in z and some outside z so that neither x ⊆ z nor x ∩ z = ∅ holds. In this case the relation is PO(x,z).

3. x may lie entirely in the overlapping part of y that is also inside z. Then x is a proper part of z. In that case the relation will be one of the two proper‐part relations:
  • NTPP(x,z) if x does not touch z’s boundary, or 
  • TPP(x,z) if x does touch z’s boundary.

Thus, depending on exactly where x is placed within y, the possible RCC‐8 relations between x and z are:

  DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.
