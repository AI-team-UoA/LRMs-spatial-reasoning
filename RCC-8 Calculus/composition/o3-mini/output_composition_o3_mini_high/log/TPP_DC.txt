PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y (and importantly, it touches y’s boundary) and DC(y,z) means y and z share no parts—not even boundaries—we can reason as follows:

• Since x is entirely contained in y (by TPP), every point of x is also a point of y.

• Because y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), no point of y (whether an interior or a boundary point) overlaps or touches any point of z.

• Therefore, there is no possibility for any point of x to be in contact with any point of z. Even though x touches the boundary of y, that boundary (being part of y) does not touch z because of the DC(y,z) condition.

Thus, the only possible spatial relation between x and z is that x and z are disconnected.
