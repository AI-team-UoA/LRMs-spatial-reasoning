PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We begin with the definitions. In RCC‑8 the relation

  NTPP(x,y)

means that x is a non‐tangential proper part of y—that is, x is entirely contained in y and does not “touch” y’s boundary. To ensure that the proper‐part always comes first in the notation, we also have defined

  NTPPi(x,y) ≡ NTPP(y,x).

Thus, when we are given

  NTPPi(y,z)

we are really saying that y is a non‐tangential proper part of z (since NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), i.e. the proper‐part appears first when read in the “forward” direction: y is the (non‐tangential) part of z).

So the two assumptions can be re‐phrased as:
  1. NTPP(x,y): x ⊂ y and x does not touch y’s boundary.
  2. y NTPP z: y ⊂ z and y does not touch z’s boundary.

Since the “non‐tangential proper part” relation (NTPP) is transitive for “well‐behaved” regions, from x ⊂ y and y ⊂ z it follows that x ⊂ z. Moreover, because x is in the interior of y and y is in the interior of z, we have that x lies in the interior of z. Thus the relation between x and z is also non‐tangential:

  NTPP(x,z).

In other words, under the given assumptions the only possible RCC‑8 relation between x and z is that x is a non‐tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
