PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the following definitions:

• TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary.
• EC(y,z) means that y and z share a boundary point but their interiors do not overlap.

Since TPP(x,y) gives x ⊆ y (with x touching y’s boundary) and EC(y,z) means that the interiors of y and z are disjoint though their closures overlap, we examine what can happen between x and z.

Any interior point of x lies in the interior of y, and since y and z have disjoint interiors, x cannot have any interior points in common with z. Thus, if x and z share any points, it can only be on their boundaries.

There are two geometrically possible cases:

1. x touches that particular portion of y’s boundary which is also in contact with z. In this case, x and z share a common boundary point, making them externally connected (EC).

2. Alternatively, x might touch y’s boundary at a part that does not coincide with the touchpoint between y and z. Then x and z have no points in common, so they are disconnected (DC).

Thus, depending on the precise placement of x within y relative to the y–z contact region, the relationship between x and z can be either DC or EC.
