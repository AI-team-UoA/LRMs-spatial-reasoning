PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since TPP(x, y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary, and EQ(y, z) means that y and z are spatially identical, we can substitute z for y. Therefore, x is a proper part of z and touches zâ€™s boundary, which is exactly the definition of TPP(x, z).

### Answer: TPP(x, z)
