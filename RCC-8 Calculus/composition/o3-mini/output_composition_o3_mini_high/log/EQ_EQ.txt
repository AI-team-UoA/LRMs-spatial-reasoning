PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(x, y) indicates that x and y are spatially identical (coincident), and EQ(y, z) similarly indicates that y and z are identical, by transitivity x must be identical to z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x, z).

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
