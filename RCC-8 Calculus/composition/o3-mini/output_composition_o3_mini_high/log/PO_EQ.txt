PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

PO(x, y) means that x and y share some spatial part but neither is a subset (or a part) of the other. EQ(y, z) means that y and z are exactly the same region. Therefore, replacing y with z in the relation PO(x, y) directly gives PO(x, z).
