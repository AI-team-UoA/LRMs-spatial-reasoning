PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start by noting the definitions:
• NTPPi(x, y) is defined as being equivalent to NTPP(y, x), which means that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x.
• EQ(y, z) means that y and z are identical (coincident).

Since y equals z, we can substitute z for y in the relation NTPPi(x, y). That is, from NTPP(y, x) we immediately have NTPP(z, x). By the definition of the inverse, NTPP(z, x) is exactly equivalent to NTPPi(x, z).

Hence, the only possible relationship between x and z is that x and z are related by NTPPi.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
