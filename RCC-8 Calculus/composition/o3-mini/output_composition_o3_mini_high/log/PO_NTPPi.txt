PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given facts:

1. PO(x,y): x and y overlap. That is, x and y share some interior part but neither is a subset of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z): By definition, NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y). Thus z is a non‐tangential proper part of y—that is, z is entirely inside y and its boundary does not touch y’s boundary.

Since z is entirely inside y, imagine y as a “big” region with z safely in the “middle.” On the other hand, x overlaps y (i.e. x ∩ y ≠ ∅) but x is not contained in y (since PO means neither is a subset of the other). Thus x must have a portion that lies outside y. With this picture in mind, the (unknown) spatial relationship between x and z (a subregion of y) can vary. For example:

• It is possible that the part of x inside y does not “reach” z at all. Then x and z are disjoint (DC).

• The part of x inside y may “just touch” z along its boundary, while not overlapping its interior. In that case x and z are externally connected (EC).

• The part of x inside y may overlap z (i.e. have a non‐empty interior intersection) without either being included in the other. Then x and z are in partial overlap (PO).

• Alternatively, the portion of x inside y might entirely cover z. Since x is not contained in y (because some of x lies outside y) it is perfectly possible that the intersection of x and y is large enough to contain z completely. In that case z is a proper part of x. Now, depending on whether the boundary of z touches the boundary of x or not, the proper‐part relation could be either tangential or non‐tangential. In RCC–8 we express the “inverse” proper‐part relations as:
  – TPPi(x,z) (which means z is a tangential proper part of x) or
  – NTPPi(x,z) (which means z is a non‐tangential proper part of x).

Notice that x cannot be a proper part of z (i.e. we cannot have TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)) because if x were completely inside z then x would be inside y (since z ⊆ y), contradicting PO(x,y).

Thus, the possible RCC–8 relations between x and z are:
  DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
