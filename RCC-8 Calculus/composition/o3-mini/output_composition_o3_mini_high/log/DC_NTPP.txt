PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Consider three regions x, y, and z with the following constraints:

• DC(x,y): x and y are completely disconnected (no common parts, not even at the boundary).

• NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z’s boundary (that is, y lies entirely in the interior of z).

Given these, let’s analyze the possibles for the relation between x and z.

1. x and z might be completely separated (DC). For example, if x is located far from z (and hence far from y as well), then clearly x and z share no common points.

2. x and z might touch at the boundary (EC). For example, x may lie immediately outside z but just contact z’s boundary—even though y lies well inside z, x remains DC from y.

3. x and z might partially overlap (PO). This can occur if x “straddles” the boundary of z; that is, part of x is outside z and part is inside. Since y is entirely inside z and x is externally separated from y (DC(x,y)), the overlap between x and z must avoid y.

4. x might be completely contained in z. In that case there are two subcases:
 • x may touch z’s boundary, giving TPP(x,z) (“tangential proper part”).
 • x may lie completely inside z without reaching its boundary, giving NTPP(x,z) (“non‐tangential proper part”).

Notice that x cannot equal z, nor can x contain z, because that would force y—which is inside z—to have a non‐empty intersection with x.

So, the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
 DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
