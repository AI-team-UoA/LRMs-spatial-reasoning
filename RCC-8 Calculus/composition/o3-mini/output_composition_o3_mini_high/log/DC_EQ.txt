PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(y, z) means that y and z are identical (coincident), replacing y with z in the relation DC(x, y) gives us DC(x, z). In other words, if x is disconnected from y and y equals z, then x must be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
