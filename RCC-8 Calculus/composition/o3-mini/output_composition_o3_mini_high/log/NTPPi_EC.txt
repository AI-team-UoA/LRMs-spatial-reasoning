PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We know that NTPPi(x,y) is defined to be equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e. y ⊆ x and y does not touch the boundary of x). Also, EC(y,z) means that y and z “touch” at their boundaries but have no overlapping interiors.

Because y lies deep inside x (since NTPP means there is a “buffer” between y and x’s boundary) and yet y touches z, the way in which z can relate to x is rather restricted. In any configuration satisfying

  (1) y ⊆ int(x)    (by NTPP(y,x))
  (2) y touches z at y’s boundary   (by EC(y,z))

one finds that z cannot be completely “outside” of x (i.e. x and z cannot be disconnected or externally connected) and x cannot be contained in z (for then y would lie entirely in the interior of z, contradicting EC(y,z)). Instead, there are two possibilities:

• First, it may be that z extends partly outside x. In this case,
  x and z have an overlapping part but neither contains the other, i.e. x PO z.

• Second, it may happen that z lies entirely inside x. Then z is a proper part of x. But whether z touches the boundary of x or not is not determined by the given information. Thus in this case either
  z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e. TPP(z,x), which by our notation is written as TPPi(x,z)) or
  z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e. NTPP(z,x), written as NTPPi(x,z)).

In summary, under the conditions NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) the possible RCC‑8 relations between x and z are:
  • PO(x,z)  or  • TPPi(x,z)  or  • NTPPi(x,z)

### Answer: PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
