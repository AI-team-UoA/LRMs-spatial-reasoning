PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with x DC y (x is disconnected from y) and y PO z (y partially overlaps z). Since x and y have no contact at all, but y and z overlap, z must “bring along” some parts that may be near or far from x. In a suitable configuration, one can have:

 • x DC z – if the portion of z that overlaps y lies far from x,
 • x EC z – if z “reaches” all the way so that it touches x’s boundary,
 • x PO z – if x and z share some interior parts (but neither is contained in the other), or
 • x TPP z or x NTPP z – if x happens to lie completely inside z (with the difference between TPP and NTPP being whether x touches z’s boundary or not).

Notice that x cannot contain z (i.e. be the inverse proper part TPPi/NTPPi) nor be identical to z (EQ) because that would force some connection between x and y via z. Thus, the only possibilities allowed by these constraints are:

 DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
