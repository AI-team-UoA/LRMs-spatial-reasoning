PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given relations:

• NTPPi(x, y), which by definition is equivalent to NTPP(y, x). That means y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (y is entirely inside x and does not touch x’s boundary).

• Similarly, NTPPi(y, z) means NTPP(z, y), so z is a non‐tangential proper part of y.

Now, since y is entirely inside x (and away from x’s boundary) and z is entirely inside y (and away from y’s boundary), it follows by transitivity that z is entirely inside x and also does not touch x’s boundary. In other words, NTPP(z, x) holds. Converting this back to the inverse relation we were using, we have:

  NTPP(z, x) ⇔ NTPPi(x, z).

Thus, the only possible RCC‑8 relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x, z)
