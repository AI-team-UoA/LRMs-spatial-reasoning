PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that x and y are disconnected, so x and y share no points, while y is a tangential proper part of z (y ⊂ z and y touches z’s boundary). Think of z as a larger region that contains y (touching its own boundary) and x as some other region that does not meet y. Then, the relation between x and z depends on where x is placed relative to z. In particular:

• x can lie completely outside z, so that x and z are disconnected (DC).

• x can be arranged so that it touches z’s boundary without overlapping its interior—making x and z externally connected (EC).

• x might also partly overlap z (entering z through some “window” in the boundary) while not being completely inside z, which is the partially overlapping case (PO).

• Alternatively, x can lie entirely inside z. In that case x is a proper part of z. Depending on whether it touches z’s boundary or not, x and z can be either tangential proper parts (TPP) or non‐tangential proper parts (NTPP).

Notice that x cannot be identical to z (EQ) nor can z be a proper part of x (which would be TPPi or NTPPi) because that would force an overlap with y (since y ⊆ z).

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z (consistent with the premises DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z)) are:

DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z)
