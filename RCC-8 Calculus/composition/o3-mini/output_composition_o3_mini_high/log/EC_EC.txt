PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EC(x, y) means that x and y touch at a boundary (with no interior overlap) and similarly EC(y, z) means that y and z share a boundary, the standard RCC‑8 composition table tells us that the relation between x and z can only be one of the following:

• DC(x, z) – disconnected  
• EC(x, z) – externally connected  
• PO(x, z) – partially overlapping

Thus, if EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, or PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO
