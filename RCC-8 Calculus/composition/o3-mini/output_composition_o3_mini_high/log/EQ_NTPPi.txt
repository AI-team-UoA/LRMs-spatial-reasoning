PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), we have x identical to y. Thus we can substitute x for y in the other relation. We are given NTPPi(y,z), and by definition NTPPi(x,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,x). (Recall that NTPPi(a,b) is just the inverse of NTPP(b,a).) In other words, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), and since y = x we have NTPP(z,x), which in turn is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is:

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
