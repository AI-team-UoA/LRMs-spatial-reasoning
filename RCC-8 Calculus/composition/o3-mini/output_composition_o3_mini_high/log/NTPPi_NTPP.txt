PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Recall that NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), i.e. y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (so y is entirely inside the interior of x), and NTPP(y,z) tells us that y is entirely inside z. Thus, y is a “core” region that lies in the interior of both x and z. This already implies that x and z must have overlapping interiors (they share at least y) so the only RCC–8 relations they can have are those in which the regions overlap; they cannot be disconnected (DC) or merely externally connected (EC).

There are several ways x and z might be arranged consistently with y ⊆ int(x) and y ⊆ int(z):

1. It may be that x and z are exactly the same region (x = z), so EQ(x,z).

2. One might contain the other. For example,
  • x ⊆ z. Then, depending on whether x touches the boundary of z or is entirely in its interior, one has either TPP(x,z) (if x touches z’s boundary) or NTPP(x,z) (if x is fully in the interior of z).
  • Or, z ⊆ x. In that case, the relation (viewing it from x to z) is either TPPi(x,z) (if z touches x’s boundary) or NTPPi(x,z) (if z is entirely in the interior of x).

3. It is also possible that neither is contained in the other, but they still “overlap” (i.e. have a nonempty intersection containing y) without one being a proper part of the other. In that case the relation is PO(x,z).

Thus, the possible RCC–8 relations between x and z are exactly those in which they overlap: they can be equal (EQ), one might be a proper part of the other (TPP, NTPP, or their inverses TPPi, NTPPi), or they may partially overlap (PO).

### Answer: EQ, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, or NTPPi.
