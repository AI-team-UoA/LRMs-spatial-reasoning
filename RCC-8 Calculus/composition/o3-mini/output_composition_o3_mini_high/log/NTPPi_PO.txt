PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (i.e. y is completely inside x, not touching its boundary). Also, PO(y,z) tells us that y and z share some interior but neither is contained in the other.

Since y lies entirely in the interior of x and yet overlaps z, there are two basic possibilities for z with respect to x:

1. z is not completely contained in x. In that case, z has parts both inside and outside x. Since y ⊆ x ∩ z (because y is inside x and overlaps z) the intersection of x and z is non‐empty, but neither contains the other. This is exactly the PO relation between x and z.

2. z is entirely contained in x. In this situation, the relation between x and z is one of proper parthood. However, whether z touches x’s boundary or not is not determined:
  • If z touches the boundary of x then z is a tangential proper part of x – which, written in the inverse form, is TPPi(x,z).
  • If z does not touch the boundary of x then it is a non‐tangential proper part of x – that is, NTPPi(x,z).

There is no possibility for x to be contained in z or for x and z to be equal, since that would force y (which is inside x) to be contained in z, contradicting PO(y,z).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are either PO, or (if z lies wholly inside x) either TPPi or NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
