PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(x, y) means x and y are identical, any relation that holds between y and z will also hold between x and z. Given that DC(y, z) tells us that y and z are disconnected (i.e., they share neither interior nor boundary points), it follows directly that x and z must also be disconnected.

### Answer: DC(x, z)
