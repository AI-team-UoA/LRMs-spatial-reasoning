PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Recall that EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical. Given TPPi(y,z), by definition we have TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y), which says that z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e. z is contained in y and touches yâ€™s boundary). Since x equals y, we substitute to obtain TPP(z,x). Now, by the definition provided, TPP(z,x) is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
