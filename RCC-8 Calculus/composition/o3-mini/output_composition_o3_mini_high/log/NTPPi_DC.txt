PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two hypotheses:

 • NTPPi(x,y) by definition means NTPP(y,x) – that is, y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (y is “deeply inside” x, so that none of y’s boundary touches x’s boundary).

 • DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected (they do not share any point, not even on a boundary).

Now, since y lies entirely (and “safely”) inside x, the fact that y is disjoint from z only tells us that whatever z is, it does not “invade” the deep interior of x (at least not the part occupied by y). However, many different global arrangements of x and z are possible. In particular, one may have:

 1. DC(x,z): x and z are entirely separated.
 2. EC(x,z): x and z touch (their boundaries meet) but do not overlap in their interiors.
 3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (share some interior part) while neither contains the other.
 4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (that is, z ⊆ x and z touches x’s boundary) – here y lies in the interior of x and can be kept separated from z.
 5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (z is completely inside x with its closure wholly in the interior of x) and is located away from y (so that y and z are DC).

Any other RCC-8 relation between x and z is ruled out. For example, if x were a proper part of z then y ⊆ x ⊆ z which would force y to have some connection with z, contradicting DC(y,z). EQ is clearly not possible either.

Thus, given NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) the possible RCC–8 relations between x and z are:

 DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).
