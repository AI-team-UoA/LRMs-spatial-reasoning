PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two given facts:

1. PO(x,y): x and y share some region, yet neither is completely contained in the other. In other words, x ∩ y ≠ Ø, x is not a subset of y, and y is not a subset of x.

2. NTPP(y,z): y is a (non‐tangential) proper part of z. That is, y ⊆ z and y lies entirely in the interior of z (so y does not touch z’s boundary).

Now, let’s consider what must be true about the relation between x and z.

Because y is a proper part of z and lies strictly in its interior, any point in the nonempty x ∩ y will lie inside z. Hence, x and z must have some overlap; they cannot be disconnected (DC) or merely externally connected (EC).

There are two main cases to consider for x relative to z:

Case 1. x is entirely contained in z (i.e. x ⊆ z).
 • Since x ∩ y ≠ Ø (with y ⊆ interior(z)), x is certainly inside z.
 • However, x is not “nested” in y because of PO(x,y), so x contains parts outside of y.
 • If x ⊆ z then there are two possibilities:
  – If x touches z’s boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).
  – If x lies entirely in the interior of z, then x is a non‐tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

Case 2. x is not entirely contained in z (i.e. x ⊈ z).
 • In this situation, even though some part of x (namely, the part overlapping y) is inside z, there is also some part of x that lies outside z.
 • This situation is exactly what the PO relation describes: the two regions share a part but neither is a subset of the other.
 • Hence, in this case, x and z are in the PO relation.

So, depending on whether x is wholly contained in z or not, the possible relationships between x and z (given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)) are:

• PO(x,z)
• TPP(x,z)
• NTPP(x,z)

Thus, the final answer is:

### Answer: PO, TPP, and NTPP.
