PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical, replacing y with z in the relation EC(x,y) immediately gives EC(x,z). Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is that they are externally connected.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
