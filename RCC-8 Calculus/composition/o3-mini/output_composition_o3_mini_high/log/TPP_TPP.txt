PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then x is necessarily a proper part of z. However, whether x touches z’s boundary depends on the specifics of how x touches y and how y touches z. There are two cases:

1. x touches z’s boundary – In this case, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).
2. x does not touch z’s boundary (i.e. it is strictly inside z’s interior) – In this case, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z)
