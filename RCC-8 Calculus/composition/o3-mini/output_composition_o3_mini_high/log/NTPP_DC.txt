PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x, y) means x is a non‐tangential proper part of y (so x is completely inside y and does not touch y’s boundary) and DC(y, z) means y and z are disconnected (they share no points, not even on their boundaries), it follows that x, being entirely inside y, cannot have any contact or overlap with z. Thus x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
