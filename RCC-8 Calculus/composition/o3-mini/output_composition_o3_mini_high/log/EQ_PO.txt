PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x, y) means x and y are identical, wherever y stands in relation to any object, x will have the same relation. Since PO(y, z) indicates that y and z share some, but not all, parts (and neither is fully contained in the other), it follows that replacing y by x (because x is identical to y) yields PO(x, z).

### Answer: PO
