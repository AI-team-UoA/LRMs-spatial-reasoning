PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical, any relation that y has with z will also hold between x and z. Given that EC(y,z) indicates that y and z are externally connected (they share a boundary without overlapping in their interiors), it follows directly that x and z must also be externally connected.
