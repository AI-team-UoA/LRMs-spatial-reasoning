PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start by writing the assumptions in an equivalent form. We are given

  TPP(x, y)  and  NTPPi(y, z).

Recall that NTPPi(y, z) is defined as being equivalent to NTPP(z, y). Thus, we have

  TPP(x, y)  and  NTPP(z, y).

That is, both x and z are proper parts of y. Moreover,
 • x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP) – meaning x is contained in y and its boundary meets the boundary of y.
 • z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (NTPP) – meaning z is contained in y but its closure lies completely in the interior of y (i.e. z does not “touch” y’s boundary).

Because x touches y’s boundary while z is strictly interior to y, we know immediately that x cannot be a proper part of z (since then x would inherit the “non‐tangential” behavior from z). In other words, x ⊆ z is ruled out.

Now, consider what may happen inside y. Both x and z lie within y, so there are several ways in which they might be arranged:

1. They may be spatially far apart so that they do not share any points (their closures do not meet)—this is the DC (Disconnected) case.
2. They may “just touch” each other (their boundaries meet but their interiors do not overlap) yielding the EC (Externally Connected) relation.
3. Their interiors may intersect but neither is contained in the other. In RCC‐8 this is the PO (Partially Overlapping) situation.
4. It is also possible that one of them is contained in the other. As argued above x cannot be contained in z, but it is possible that z is entirely contained in x. In that case, from the point of view of x and z the proper‐part relation (the container–containee relationship) applies. And there are two variants:
  a. z may be “tangent” to x’s boundary (i.e. z touches x’s boundary) which is expressed as TPPi(x, z) (recalling that TPPi(x, z) ≡ TPP(z, x)).
  b. Or z may lie entirely in the interior of x (i.e. z does not reach x’s boundary) which is expressed as NTPPi(x, z) (since NTPPi(x, z) means NTPP(z, x)).

Thus, the only possibilities for the relation between x and z (remember, they cannot be equal and x cannot be a proper part of z) are the following five RCC‑8 relations:

• DC (Disconnected)
• EC (Externally Connected)
• PO (Partial Overlap)
• TPPi (the inverse of TPP, meaning that z is a tangential proper part of x)
• NTPPi (the inverse of NTPP, meaning that z is a non‐tangential proper part of x)

Consequently, the final answer is:

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.
