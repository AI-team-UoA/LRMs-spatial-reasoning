PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary, and TPPi(y,z) (by definition the same as TPP(z,y)) means that y is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary, we know that x ⊆ y and y ⊆ z. By transitivity of the part‐of relation, we have x ⊆ z. Since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, x is strictly contained in z (x ≠ z).

Now, in RCC-8 the only two relations that capture a “proper part” relationship between x and z are:
• TPP(x,z) – where x is a tangential proper part of z (i.e. x touches the boundary of z)
• NTPP(x,z) – where x is a non-tangential proper part of z (i.e. x does not touch the boundary of z)

Which of these holds depends on the particular positions of x and y inside z. For example, if the part of y that x touches is exactly at the location where y meets z’s boundary, then x will also touch z’s boundary (yielding TPP(x,z)). Otherwise, if the point of contact between x and y is not aligned with y’s contact with z, then x will lie entirely within the interior of z (yielding NTPP(x,z)).

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z are:

### Answer: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
