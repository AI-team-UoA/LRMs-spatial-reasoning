PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the definitions:

 • NTPP(x,y) means “x is a proper part of y and does not touch y’s boundary.”

 • Its converse NTPPi(x,y) is defined as NTPP(y,x) (i.e. “y is a non‐tangential proper part of x”).

 • TPP(x,y) means “x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary.”

 • Its converse TPPi(x,y) is defined as TPP(y,x) (i.e. “y is a tangential proper part of x”).

Now, the assumptions are:

 (1) NTPPi(x,y), which is the same as saying NTPP(y,x). This tells us that y is strictly inside x (its closure lies in the interior of x, so y does not reach x’s boundary).

 (2) TPPi(y,z), which is the same as saying TPP(z,y). This tells us that z is a proper part of y and z touches y’s boundary.

Since z ⊆ y and y ⊆ int(x), it follows that z ⊆ int(x) as well. In other words, even though z touches the boundary of y, it is still “buffered” away from x’s boundary. This means that in the relationship between x and z the contained region z does not touch x’s boundary.

But when one region (z) is a proper part of another (x) and does not touch the boundary of its container, the relation is by definition non‐tangential proper part. In the RCC‑8 notation this is written as NTPP(z,x). Equivalently, using the inverse notation (where the first argument is the container) we can write NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible RCC‑8 relation between x and z is that z is a non‐tangential proper part of x.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
