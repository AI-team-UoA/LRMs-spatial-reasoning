PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given relations:

• EC(x,y): x is externally connected to y (they touch at the boundary but share no interior).

• NTPP(y,z): y is a non‐tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z, and y’s contact with z’s boundary is avoided).

Now, since y is non‐tangentially contained in z, y lies strictly in the interior of z (its closure does not meet z’s boundary). Meanwhile, x is externally connected to y, so x touches y along its boundary. Because y’s boundary is inside z, x must also reach into the interior of z. However, x may or may not be completely contained in z. This leads to two general situations:

1. x is entirely inside z. In that case, x is a proper part of z. Depending on whether x touches z’s boundary or not, it could be:
  • TPP(x,z) if x touches z’s boundary, or
  • NTPP(x,z) if x does not touch z’s boundary.

2. x is not wholly contained in z (i.e. part of x lies outside z) while still intersecting z. Then x and z share some but not all parts, which is the PO (partial overlap) relation.

Thus, the only possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:

  PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z)
