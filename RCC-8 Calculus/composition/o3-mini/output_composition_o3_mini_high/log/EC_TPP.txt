PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the facts:

• EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior points.

• TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary (so y ⊆ z, y ≠ z, and some part of y’s boundary is on z’s boundary).

Now, because y is contained in z, any contact that x has with y must occur “inside” z or right at z’s boundary. But x itself is free to lie in different positions relative to z. In fact, there are several qualitatively different ways in which x may be arranged with respect to z while still having x EC y and y TPP z. We now describe four general cases:

1. x is completely inside z. In this case x ⊆ z. There are two subcases:
 a. x touches the boundary of z. Then by definition x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e. TPP(x,z).
 b. x does not touch z’s boundary (its entire interior is in the interior of z). Then x is a non‐tangential proper part of z, i.e. NTPP(x,z).

2. x overlaps z without being contained in it. This happens if part of x lies inside z and part lies outside. Then x and z share interior points, but neither is contained within the other – that is the PO relation.

3. x is entirely outside z. In this scenario, x can still touch y (since y ⊆ z) if the touching occurs at a point of y that also lies on z’s boundary. Then x and z have no common interior points but do share a boundary point. In RCC‑8 terminology, this means EC(x,z).

To summarize, from the constraints EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) the relationship between x and z may be any one of the following:

• TPP(x,z)
• NTPP(x,z)
• PO(x,z)
• EC(x,z)

Thus, the final answer is:

### Answer: TPP, NTPP, PO, and EC.
