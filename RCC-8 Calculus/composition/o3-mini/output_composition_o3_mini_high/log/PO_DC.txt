PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the following facts:

• PO(x, y) means x and y overlap (they share some interior but neither is contained in the other). In particular, x ∩ y ≠ ∅, and both x\y and y\x are non‐empty.

• DC(y, z) means y and z are disconnected. In other words, y and z share no points (neither interior nor boundary).

Because y is completely disjoint from z, any point of x that lies in y cannot be in z. Thus, if x and z have any common points, these must come from the portion of x that is outside y.

Now consider what spatial configurations for x and z are possible without causing conflict with DC(y, z):

1. It is possible that the part of x outside y is positioned so that x and z have no touch whatsoever. Then x and z are disconnected (DC).

2. It is also possible that although x and z do not overlap (in the sense of interior intersection), some point of x (coming from the part outside y) touches the boundary of z. In that case x and z are externally connected (EC).

3. Another possibility is that the part of x outside y partly overlaps with z (i.e. they share some interior). In that situation x and z are in the PO (partial overlap) relation.

4. Finally, the part of x outside y may completely contain z. (Notice that x cannot be contained in z—if x were entirely inside z then x ∩ y ⊆ y ∩ z, contradicting that y and z are DC.) So, it is possible that z is a proper part of x. Then the relation between x and z is one of the two “inverse proper‐part” relations: either TPPi (if z touches the boundary of x) or NTPPi (if z is strictly inside x, not in contact with the boundary).

Any other relationship (such as EQ or TPP/NTPP with x as the proper part) would force x and z to share parts coming from y, contradicting DC(y, z).

Thus, given PO(x, y) and DC(y, z), the only consistent RCC‑8 relations that x and z may have are:

  DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
