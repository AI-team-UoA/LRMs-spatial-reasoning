{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical, we can substitute z for y in the relation NTPP(x,y). Therefore, NTPP(x,y) implies NTPP(x,z).\n\nIn other words, x is a non-tangential proper part of y. Since y equals z, x is also a non-tangential proper part of z. There is no other possibility.\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 17.74510145187378, "reasoning-tokens": 1472, "completion-tokens": 1612}
