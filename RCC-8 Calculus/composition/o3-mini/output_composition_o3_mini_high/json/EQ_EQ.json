{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(x, y) indicates that x and y are spatially identical (coincident), and EQ(y, z) similarly indicates that y and z are identical, by transitivity x must be identical to z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x, z).\n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 6.344338417053223, "reasoning-tokens": 576, "completion-tokens": 680}
