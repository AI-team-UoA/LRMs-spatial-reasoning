{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Recall that by definition TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x) \u2013 that is, y is a tangential proper part of x (y \u228a x and y \u201ctouches\u201d x\u2019s boundary) \u2013 and TPP(y,z) says that y is a tangential proper part of z.\n\nThus we know that y is (a proper, touching) part of both x and z. In any configuration of connected regions, this forces x and z to have non\u2010empty intersection (they at least share y) and in fact they must \u201cagree\u201d near the point where y touches the boundary of z (and also of x). One may then show that there are only three general cases for the relation between x and z:\n\n1. x and z are identical (EQ). (This can happen if the two \u201ccontainer\u201d regions turn out to be the same overall region.)\n\n2. One region is (tangentially) a proper part of the other. For example, if x \u228a z then because y \u2286 x and since y touches the boundary of z it follows that x must also come into contact with the boundary of z. In other words, x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)). Similarly, if z \u228a x then we have TPP(z,x), i.e. TPPi(x,z).\n\n3. Neither of the two regions is contained in the other; they \u201coverlap\u201d (PO). In this case x and z share y (hence a non\u2010empty region) but each also has parts that the other does not contain.\n\nIt is important to note that although in RCC-8 there are also the nontangential proper part relations (NTPP and NTPPi), these cannot occur here. To explain briefly: if, say, x \u2286 z were to hold in a nontangential way (NTPP(x,z)), then x would be entirely \u201cinside\u201d z (with its entire interior in the interior of z). But since y (which is a subset of x) touches z\u2019s boundary (by TPP(y,z)), some point of x would have to lie on z\u2019s boundary \u2013 contradicting the non\u2010tangential condition.\n\nThus, the only possibilities for the relation between x and z are exactly the following (all in the standard RCC\u20108 vocabulary):\n\n\u2022 EQ(x,z)\n\u2022 TPP(x,z) or, symmetrically, TPPi(x,z)\n\u2022 PO(x,z)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003### Answer: EQ, TPP (or its inverse TPPi), or PO.
