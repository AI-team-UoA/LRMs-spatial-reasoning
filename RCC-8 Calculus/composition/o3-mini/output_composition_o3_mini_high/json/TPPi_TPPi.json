{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Recall that TPPi(x,y) is defined as TPP(y,x); that is, y is a tangential proper part of x (y \u2282 x and y touches x\u2019s boundary). Thus, TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x that touches x\u2019s boundary, and similarly TPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y that touches y\u2019s boundary. This gives us the chain:\n\n\u2003\u2003z \u2282 y \u2282 x.\n\nBecause the proper\u2010part relation is transitive, z is a proper part of x. What remains is the question of the \u201ctouching\u201d condition between z and x. There are two possibilities:\n\n1. It may happen that the point(s) where z touches y include the point(s) via which y touches x. Then z will also touch the boundary of x. In this case, we say z is a tangential proper part of x, which is represented (in the conventional order where the proper part is written first) as TPP(z,x) or, equivalently, TPPi(x,z).\n\n2. On the other hand, it may be that z does not \u201cinherit\u201d the tangency with x (i.e. z lies entirely in the interior of y away from that particular part of y\u2019s boundary that touches x). Then z is a non\u2010tangential proper part of x, written as NTPP(z,x) or, equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).\n\nThus, the possible relationships between x and z (expressed with x as the first argument, following the pattern of TPPi) are:\n\n\u2003\u2003Either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).\n\n### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 35.53401803970337, "reasoning-tokens": 4352, "completion-tokens": 4788}
