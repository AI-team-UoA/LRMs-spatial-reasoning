{"prompt": "If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(y, z) means that y and z are identical (coincident), replacing y with z in the relation DC(x, y) gives us DC(x, z). In other words, if x is disconnected from y and y equals z, then x must be disconnected from z.\n\n### Answer: DC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 8.044606924057007, "reasoning-tokens": 896, "completion-tokens": 997}
