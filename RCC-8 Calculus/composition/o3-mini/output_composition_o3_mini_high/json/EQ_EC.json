{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical, any relation that y has with z will also hold between x and z. Given that EC(y,z) indicates that y and z are externally connected (they share a boundary without overlapping in their interiors), it follows directly that x and z must also be externally connected.\n\n### Answer: EC", "elapsed-time": 6.717021226882935, "reasoning-tokens": 576, "completion-tokens": 683}
