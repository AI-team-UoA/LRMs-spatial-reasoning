{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "From the definition, TPPi(x,y) means exactly that TPP(y,x) holds (i.e. y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is contained in x and touches its boundary).\n\nNow, given EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are identical.\n\nThus, replacing y by z, we have TPP(z,x). This is equivalent (by definition) to TPPi(x,z).\n\nSo the only possible relationship between x and z is that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e. TPPi(x,z).\n\n### Answer: TPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 27.627163648605347, "reasoning-tokens": 2240, "completion-tokens": 2431}
