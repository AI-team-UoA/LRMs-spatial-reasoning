{"prompt": "If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "We will show that having x partially\u2010overlap y and y partially\u2010overlap z (written PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)) does not force a unique RCC\u20118 relation between x and z. In fact, one may construct examples in which the relation between x and z is any one of the following base relations:\n\n\u2022 DC (Disconnected)  \n\u2022 EC (Externally Connected)  \n\u2022 PO (Partially Overlapping)  \n\u2022 TPP (Tangential Proper Part)  \n\u2022 TPPi (the converse of TPP, i.e. x is a proper part of z or vice\u2010versa)\n\nA short explanation follows.\n\nRecall that PO(x,y) means that x and y share some interior but neither is contained in the other. Thus, there is \u201croom\u201d for variation: even though x and y overlap, x might lie at one end of y while some other part of y overlaps with z. For example, if y \u201cbridges\u201d two regions then it is quite possible that the piece of y that meets x is separated (or only barely in contact) with the part of y that meets z \u2013 so that x and z are even disconnected (DC) or merely touching (EC). Alternatively, the overlaps may \u201cline\u2010up\u201d so that x and z themselves have a nonempty interior intersection (PO). Finally, one may arrange that x (or z) is entirely contained in z (or x) \u2014 though, by the definition of PO, neither x is contained in y nor y in x, and similarly for y and z. In such cases one may have x \u2286 z (or z \u2286 x) but still have x PO y and y PO z. In RCC\u20118 such a containment (with x \u2260 z) is described by TPP (or its converse TPPi). (In many presentations the further distinction between \u201ctangential\u201d and \u201cnon\u2010tangential\u201d proper part is made; however, the information in PO is not sufficient to decide this detail so that the proper\u2010part possibilities are usually given only as TPP/TPPi.)\n\nThus, the composition of two PO relations leads to an \u201cuncertainty\u201d result:\n\u2003\u2003PO \u2218 PO \u2286 {DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi}.\n\n(Notice that although one may have the degenerate case x = z \u2013 which is written EQ \u2013 the usual composition table for PO does not list EQ. In many applications one assumes that the objects are distinct so that EQ is ruled out.)\n\n### Answer: \nThe possible RCC\u20118 relations between x and z (given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)) are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and TPPi.", "elapsed-time": 77.41135716438293, "reasoning-tokens": 12608, "completion-tokens": 13243}
