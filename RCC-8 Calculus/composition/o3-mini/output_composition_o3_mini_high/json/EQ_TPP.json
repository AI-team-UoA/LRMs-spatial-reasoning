{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical, the relation TPP(y,z) (y is a tangential proper part of z) directly transfers to x. That is, x is the same as y and thus x is a tangential proper part of z. \n\n### Answer: TPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 15.76946210861206, "reasoning-tokens": 1280, "completion-tokens": 1392}
