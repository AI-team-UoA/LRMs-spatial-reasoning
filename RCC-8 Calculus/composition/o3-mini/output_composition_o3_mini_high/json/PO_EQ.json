{"prompt": "If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "PO(x, y) means that x and y share some spatial part but neither is a subset (or a part) of the other. EQ(y, z) means that y and z are exactly the same region. Therefore, replacing y with z in the relation PO(x, y) directly gives PO(x, z).\n\n### Answer: PO", "elapsed-time": 10.538858652114868, "reasoning-tokens": 1280, "completion-tokens": 1390}
