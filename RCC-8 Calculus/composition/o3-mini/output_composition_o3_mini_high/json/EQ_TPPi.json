{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Recall that EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical. Given TPPi(y,z), by definition we have TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y), which says that z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e. z is contained in y and touches y\u2019s boundary). Since x equals y, we substitute to obtain TPP(z,x). Now, by the definition provided, TPP(z,x) is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).\n\nThus, the only possible relationship between x and z is:\n\n### Answer: TPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 37.816115856170654, "reasoning-tokens": 4352, "completion-tokens": 4530}
