{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since TPP(x, y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary, and EQ(y, z) means that y and z are spatially identical, we can substitute z for y. Therefore, x is a proper part of z and touches z\u2019s boundary, which is exactly the definition of TPP(x, z).\n\n### Answer: TPP(x, z)", "elapsed-time": 10.851431846618652, "reasoning-tokens": 1408, "completion-tokens": 1526}
