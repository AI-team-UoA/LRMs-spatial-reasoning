{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "We begin with the definitions. In RCC\u20118 the relation\n\n\u2003\u2003NTPP(x,y)\n\nmeans that x is a non\u2010tangential proper part of y\u2014that is, x is entirely contained in y and does not \u201ctouch\u201d y\u2019s boundary. To ensure that the proper\u2010part always comes first in the notation, we also have defined\n\n\u2003\u2003NTPPi(x,y) \u2261 NTPP(y,x).\n\nThus, when we are given\n\n\u2003\u2003NTPPi(y,z)\n\nwe are really saying that y is a non\u2010tangential proper part of z (since NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), i.e. the proper\u2010part appears first when read in the \u201cforward\u201d direction: y is the (non\u2010tangential) part of z).\n\nSo the two assumptions can be re\u2010phrased as:\n\u2003\u20031. NTPP(x,y): x \u2282 y and x does not touch y\u2019s boundary.\n\u2003\u20032. y NTPP z: y \u2282 z and y does not touch z\u2019s boundary.\n\nSince the \u201cnon\u2010tangential proper part\u201d relation (NTPP) is transitive for \u201cwell\u2010behaved\u201d regions, from x \u2282 y and y \u2282 z it follows that x \u2282 z. Moreover, because x is in the interior of y and y is in the interior of z, we have that x lies in the interior of z. Thus the relation between x and z is also non\u2010tangential:\n\n\u2003\u2003NTPP(x,z).\n\nIn other words, under the given assumptions the only possible RCC\u20118 relation between x and z is that x is a non\u2010tangential proper part of z.\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 71.24750900268555, "reasoning-tokens": 10496, "completion-tokens": 10929}
