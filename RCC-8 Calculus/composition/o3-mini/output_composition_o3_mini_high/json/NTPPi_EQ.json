{"prompt": "If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "We start by noting the definitions:\n\u2022 NTPPi(x, y) is defined as being equivalent to NTPP(y, x), which means that y is a non\u2010tangential proper part of x.\n\u2022 EQ(y, z) means that y and z are identical (coincident).\n\nSince y equals z, we can substitute z for y in the relation NTPPi(x, y). That is, from NTPP(y, x) we immediately have NTPP(z, x). By the definition of the inverse, NTPP(z, x) is exactly equivalent to NTPPi(x, z).\n\nHence, the only possible relationship between x and z is that x and z are related by NTPPi.\n\n### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 31.888486623764038, "reasoning-tokens": 3648, "completion-tokens": 3869}
