{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical, replacing y with z in the relation EC(x,y) immediately gives EC(x,z). Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is that they are externally connected.\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 10.279188871383667, "reasoning-tokens": 1088, "completion-tokens": 1185}
