{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that NTPP(x, y) means that x is a non\u2010tangential proper part of y (i.e. x is contained in y but does not reach y\u2019s boundary), and EQ(y, z) means that y and z are exactly the same region, we can substitute z for y in the first relation. This directly leads us to conclude that x is a non\u2010tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x, z).\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x, z)", "elapsed-time": 4.710206508636475, "reasoning-tokens": 192, "completion-tokens": 311}
