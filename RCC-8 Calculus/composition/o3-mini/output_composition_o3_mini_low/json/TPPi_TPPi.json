{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "We start with the two premises. Recall that by definition:\n\n\u2022\u2003TPP(x,y) means \u201cx is a proper part of y and touches y\u2019s boundary.\u201d\n\u2022\u2003TPPi(x,y) is defined to be equivalent to TPP(y,x) \u2013 that is, y is a proper part of x and touches x\u2019s boundary.\n\nThus, stating TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e. y \u2282 x and y touches x\u2019s boundary). Similarly, TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y.\n\nNow we can \u201cchain\u201d the information:\n\n1. From TPPi(x,y): y is properly contained in x and meets the boundary of x.\n2. From TPPi(y,z): z is properly contained in y and meets the boundary of y.\n\nSince z \u2282 y and y \u2282 x, transitivity of \u201cpart\u2010of\u201d tells us that z is a proper part of x. However, regarding whether z touches the boundary of x or not, we have two possibilities. Depending on the exact spatial configuration, the following cases may occur:\n\nA. z touches the boundary of x. In that case, when we express the relation using the inverse of TPP we say TPPi(x,z) (i.e. z is a tangential proper part of x).\n\nB. z does not touch the boundary of x (despite touching the boundary of y). Then, z is a non\u2010tangential proper part of x, written as NTPPi(x,z) (which means NTPP(x,z), i.e. z is a non\u2010tangential proper part of x).\n\nThus, the possible relationships between x and z are that z is either a tangential proper part of x or a non\u2010tangential proper part of x.\n\n### Answer: TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 8.362292528152466, "reasoning-tokens": 768, "completion-tokens": 1221}
