{"prompt": "If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "We will show that when we assume that\n\n\u2003\u2003(1) x partially overlaps y (written PO(x,y)) and  \n\u2003\u2003(2) y is \u201cin\u2010a TPPi\u2013relation\u201d with z (written TPPi(y,z))\u2014\n\nthen, keeping in mind that TPPi is defined as the converse of TPP, the relationship TPPi(y,z) means that\n\n\u2003\u2003TPPi(y,z) \u21d4 TPP(z,y).\n\nIn words TPP(z,y) tells us \u201cz is a proper part of y that touches y\u2019s boundary.\u201d (That is, z is \u201cjust inside\u201d y; it is contained in y but \u201ccomes right to the edge\u201d of y.)\n\nLet us now explain the setup and then justify what may happen between x and z.\n\n1. Because PO(x,y) holds, x and y have a non\u2010empty overlap (their interiors have nonempty intersection) but neither is a part of the other. In other words, x \u201csticks partly into\u201d y, and also leaves some of its mass outside y.\n\n2. Since TPP(z,y) holds, we have that z \u2282 y (with z \u201ctouching\u201d the boundary of y) but z is certainly \u201cinside\u201d y.\n\nThus, the overlap between x and y (which we call I = x \u2229 y) may \u201ccover\u201d z completely, partially, or miss z entirely. In other words, since x enters y in some \u201cwindow,\u201d we can imagine three (broad) families of possibilities as to what the spatial relation between x and z may be.\n\n(a) In one case x\u2019s \u201cintrusion\u201d into y might be placed so that it does not hit z at all. (For example, imagine that y is a disk, z a circular \u201chole\u201d somewhere inside y near its boundary, and x a region that touches y but \u201centers\u201d y at a different part.) In that situation x and z do not share any part. They might be simply disconnected (DC) or \u2013 if their boundaries happen to meet \u2013 externally connected (EC).\n\n(b) In another case the part of x that lies inside y might meet z in a \u201cpartial\u2010overlap\u201d way. (Imagine now that x \u201cpokes in\u201d so that it overlaps partially with z but does not cover it entirely, nor is z contained in x.) In that situation the most natural conclusion is that the relation between x and z is PO.\n\n(c) In a third case the manner in which x \u201cintrudes\u201d into y might be such that it \u201ccovers\u201d z entirely, that is, z is completely inside x. (Here x \u201creaches in\u201d far enough to swallow all of z even though x as a whole is not contained in y, for it extends outside.) Now one must decide whether x \u201cjust barely\u201d covers z (touching its boundary) \u2013 which is expressed by saying \u201cz is a TPP of x\u201d (i.e. TPP(x,z) holds) \u2013 or whether z is \u201cdeeply inside\u201d x (so that the boundary of z is not even touched by x\u2019s interior). In the language of RCC\u20108 one would express these as either TPP or NTPP (with the inverses TPPi or NTPPi occurring when we consider the converse relation).\n\nThus, between x and z we cannot rule out the possibility that:\n\u2003\u2022 they are separated (with no shared interior) -- either DC or EC,\n\u2003\u2022 they partially overlap (PO), or\n\u2003\u2022 one is a proper part of the other (in one of two ways\u2014\u201ctouching\u201d or \u201cnon\u2010touching\u201d)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 i.e. either TPP or NTPP in one direction (or, equivalently, TPPi or NTPPi in the opposite direction).\n\nIt is impossible for x and z to be equal (EQ) because z is properly contained in y while x only partly overlaps y.\n\nBecause we are not given any additional metric or topological detail, all of these alternatives are really \u201cin principle\u201d possible given only the two facts PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).\n\nFinal answer in the requested form:\n\n\u2003\u2003### Answer: The possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP (or its converse TPPi), NTPP (or its converse NTPPi).", "elapsed-time": 16.867700815200806, "reasoning-tokens": 1472, "completion-tokens": 2389}
