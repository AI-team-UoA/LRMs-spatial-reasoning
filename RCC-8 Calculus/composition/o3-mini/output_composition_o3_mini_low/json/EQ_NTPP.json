{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical, we can substitute x for y. Therefore, if NTPP(y,z) holds (i.e. y is a non\u2010tangential proper part of z), then replacing y with x immediately gives NTPP(x,z).\n\nThus, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).\n\n### Answer: NTPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 4.635938882827759, "reasoning-tokens": 448, "completion-tokens": 546}
