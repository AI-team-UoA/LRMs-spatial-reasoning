{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical, any spatial relationship that holds between y and z will equally hold between x and z. Therefore, if EC(y,z) then we must have EC(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 3.0834243297576904, "reasoning-tokens": 128, "completion-tokens": 190}
