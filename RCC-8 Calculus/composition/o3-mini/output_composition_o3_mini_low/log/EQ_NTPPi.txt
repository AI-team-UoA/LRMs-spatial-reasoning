PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), we know that x and y are identical, meaning that any spatial relationship involving y can be substituted by x. The relation NTPPi(y,z) is defined as being equivalent to NTPP(z,y), which states that z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (i.e. z is strictly inside y without touching its boundary). Because x equals y, we can rewrite NTPP(z,y) as NTPP(z,x). By the definition of NTPPi, NTPP(z,x) is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z under these conditions is that z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (or equivalently, x is in the NTPPi relation with z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
