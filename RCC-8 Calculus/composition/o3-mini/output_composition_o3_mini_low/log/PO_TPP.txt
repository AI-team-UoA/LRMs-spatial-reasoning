PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We begin with the following assumptions about our regions:
 • PO(x,y) means that x and y share some (but not all) interior, and neither is contained in the other.
 • TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary.

Because y ⊆ z (since TPP(y,z) holds), any overlap between x and y ensures that at least part of x lies inside z. But x might also extend partly outside z. In fact, two main cases arise:

1. x is not entirely inside z. Then part of x lies in z (since it must overlap y) and part lies outside z. In this case, x and z share some interior but x is not a subset of z – they overlap. By definition this is the PO (partial overlap) relation.

2. x is entirely inside z. Then x ⊆ z. But then there is still a “partial overlap” with y because x is not fully included in y (since PO(x,y) tells us that x ⊄ y). In this situation x is a proper part of z. However, depending on whether x touches the boundary of z or not the relation could be:
 – TPP(x,z) if x touches z’s boundary, or 
 – NTPP(x,z) if x is strictly inside z (that is, x does not hit z’s boundary).

Thus, given the two cases there are three possibilities for the relationship between x and z: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z)
