PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the assumptions:
 • x NTPP y, which means that x is a proper part of y and even its boundary is in the interior of y.
 • y PO z, meaning that y and z have some overlap (their interiors intersect) but neither is a subset of the other.

Because x is entirely inside y (and “well away” from y’s boundary), the way x relates to z depends on where within y it is located relative to the part of y that overlaps with z. In particular, one may have three different scenarios:

1. x lies entirely in that part of y that is also in z. Then x is completely inside z. Moreover, since x does not touch the boundary of y (and by suitable choice also does not touch the “internal” boundary of z) we get x NTPP z.

2. x lies entirely in the part of y that is outside of z. In that case x does not meet z at all. Hence x and z are disconnected (DC).

3. x straddles the boundary between y ∩ z and y – z. Since x is connected it cannot “split” arbitrarily; however, it is possible for x (as a whole connected region) to meet z on one part while its remainder lies outside z. In that situation the interiors of x and z overlap (so they are not DC and not in a containment relation) yet neither is a subset of the other. Thus the relation between x and z is PO.

There is no other possibility. (Note that relations such as TPP or EC would require x to touch the boundary of the containing region, but x is assumed to be non‐tangential relative to y; and here we get no reason to single out z’s boundary unless it happens “by accident” to give the PO scenario.)

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, PO, or NTPP.

### Answer: DC, PO, or NTPP.
