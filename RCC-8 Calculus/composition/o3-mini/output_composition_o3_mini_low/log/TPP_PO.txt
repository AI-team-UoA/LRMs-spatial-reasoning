PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two assumptions:

 • TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary.
 • PO(y,z): y partially overlaps z (so y and z have some – but not full – overlap).

Now, for the relation between x and z, note that x lies entirely inside y. But since y overlaps z, there are several possibilities for where x might lie relative to z. For example, since y has some parts outside z there is the possibility that x might be chosen so that it lies entirely in the portion of y that does not intersect z (or at least is “away” from z), in which case x and z will be disjoint (DC). Alternatively, x might be partly inside the z–part of y and partly outside, yielding a partial overlap (PO); and yet again it is possible that x lies entirely within the part of y that is shared with z. In that case, x is completely contained in z. But even then there are two further possibilities: it could be that x touches the boundary of z (we would then say TPP(x,z)), or it might lie strictly in the interior of z (NTPP(x,z)).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: 
  • DC (disconnected)
  • PO (partial overlap)
  • TPP (x is a proper part of z and touches its boundary)
  • NTPP (x is a proper part of z, not touching the boundary)

It is also possible in borderline configurations that the contact between x and z is “just” at a boundary (which is already captured by TPP) or that x’s only relation with z is by a shared boundary. (Note that the relation EC – externally connected – does not come into play here because x is a proper part of y and so cannot be externally connected with z without sharing some interior with y.) 

Thus one acceptable answer is that, if TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the relation between x and z may be any of DC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: DC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.
