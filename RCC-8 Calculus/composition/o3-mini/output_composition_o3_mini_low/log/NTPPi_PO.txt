PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given:

• NTPPi(x,y) is defined as “NTPP(y,x)” – that is, y is a non‐tangential proper part of x: y is entirely inside x (with a “margin” not touching x’s boundary).

• PO(y,z) means that y and z share some but not all interior parts – neither is a subset of the other.

Since y ⊆ x (in fact, y ⊂ x in the strong sense), every point of y is inside x. Meanwhile, PO(y,z) tells us that z and y overlap but z does not contain y and y does not contain z. (In particular, some part of y lies in z—but there is also some part of y that is outside z.)

Now, because y ⊆ x and y ∩ z ≠ ∅ we know that x and z must overlap (they share at least the part y ∩ z). However, z may lie partly outside x or it may be wholly contained in x. Thus we must consider two cases:

1. z is not entirely inside x.  
 – In this instance z has some parts outside of x as well as some parts within x (since y ⊆ x, the overlap y ∩ z is inside x). In this situation x and z will share some—but not all—of their parts, and neither is a proper part of the other. That is the PO (partial overlap) relation holds between x and z.

2. z is entirely inside x.  
 – Then we have x ⊇ z. However, because y PO z and y is not contained in z, it must be that z is not “big enough” to contain all of x. Thus, z is a proper part of x.  
 – In the RCC‐8 vocabulary there are two ways in which one object can be a proper part of another: either tangentially (TPP) or non-tangentially (NTPP). Since our statements do not specify whether the boundary of x meets the boundary of z or not, both possibilities can occur.  
 – However the proper part relationship here is with z being inside x, so from the point of view of the pair (x,z) we say that z is a proper part of x. (Recall that TPP(y,z) means “y is a proper part of z” with a tangential contact; its “inverse” TPPi(x,y) means “y TPP(x)” i.e. y is a proper part of x.)  
 – Thus when z ⊆ x the relation between x and z will be either TPPi(x,z) (if z touches the boundary of x) or NTPPi(x,z) (if z does not reach the boundary of x).

To sum up, depending on the “size” and location of z relative to x we can have one of three possibilities for the relation between x and z:

• Either x and z partially overlap (PO) if z is not entirely contained in x,  
• Or z is a proper part of x – with the two variants being that z either touches x’s boundary (in which case we have TPPi(x,z)) or it does not (NTPPi(x,z)).

Thus, the final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z)
