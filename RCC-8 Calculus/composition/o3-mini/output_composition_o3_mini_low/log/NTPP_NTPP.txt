PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x, y) means that x is a non‐tangential proper part of y (that is, x is entirely inside y and does not even touch y’s boundary), and likewise y is a non‐tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y, z)), by transitivity we have that x is entirely inside y and y is entirely inside z. In consequence, x is entirely inside z without touching z’s boundary, so x is a non‐tangential proper part of z.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x, z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
