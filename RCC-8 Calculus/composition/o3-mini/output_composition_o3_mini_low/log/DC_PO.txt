PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

If we know that x is disconnected from y and that y partially overlaps z, we need to consider what that implies about the spatial configuration of x and z. When x and y are disconnected (DC), there is a clear gap between x and y. However, z overlaps with y, which means z extends into the region where y is located, yet there is also some part of z not contained in y.

Depending on how z extends relative to the gap between x and y, there are a few possibilities for the relation between x and z:

• It is possible that x remains completely separate from z (DC) if the overlapping part of z with y lies far enough away from x.  
• Alternatively, x could be just externally in contact with z (EC) if the portion of z that lies next to y is sufficiently close to x for their boundaries to touch.  
• Lastly, x might even share a portion of its interior with z (PO) if some of z extends into the vicinity of x such that they share a spatial part, while still not having a containment relationship.

Thus, the possible spatial relationships between x and z are DC, EC, and PO.
