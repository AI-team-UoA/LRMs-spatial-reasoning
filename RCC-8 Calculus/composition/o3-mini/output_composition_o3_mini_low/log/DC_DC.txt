PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The two given relations only tell us that y does not share any point with x (DC(x,y)) and does not share any point with z (DC(y,z)). However, nothing further is specified about how x and z relate. In other words, even though both x and z are disjoint from y, they can be arranged arbitrarily with respect to one another.

Thus, x and z may be:
 • disconnected (DC),
 • externally connected (EC),
 • partially overlapping (PO),
 • one a tangential proper part of the other (TPP or TPPi),
 • one a non‐tangential proper part of the other (NTPP or NTPPi), or
 • even coincident (EQ).

There is no further constraint preventing any one of these eight RCC‐8 relations from holding between x and z.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.
