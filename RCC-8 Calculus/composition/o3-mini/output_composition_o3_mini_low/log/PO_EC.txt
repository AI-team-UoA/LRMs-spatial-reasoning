PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We begin with the following setup. We are given that

  PO(x,y)  and  EC(y,z).

Recall that by definition

 • PO(x,y) means that x and y overlap (i.e. share some “internal” region) but neither region is a proper part of the other.
 • EC(y,z) means that y and z meet at the boundary but do not have any interior in common.

A standard way to “guess” what may happen between x and z is to consider the many ways the overlapping region of x with y might “propagate” its contact via y’s “contact” with z. Informally, depending on the particular configuration of the three regions, one may have that

 – x and z are completely separated (DC),
 – x and z stand in external connection (EC),
 – x and z overlap (PO),
 – x falls entirely within z in such a way that it touches z’s boundary (TPP), or
 – conversely, z falls entirely within x (TPPi).

This kind of reasoning (albeit informal) is completely in keeping with the RCC‐8 approach to qualitative spatial reasoning, and indeed one may consult standard composition tables for RCC‑8 which tell us that when one composes PO with EC the result is in general the union of the following RCC‑8 base relations:

  {DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi}.

Thus, if PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then the relationship between x and z could be any one of DC, EC, PO, TPP, or TPPi.

### Answer: {DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi}
