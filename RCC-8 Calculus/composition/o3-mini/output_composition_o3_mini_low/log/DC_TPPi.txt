PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the facts:

1. DC(x,y) means that x and y are spatially separated (they share no points, not even touching boundaries).
2. TPPi(y,z) is defined as TPP(z,y), which tells us that z is a tangential proper part of y (that is, z is strictly contained in y, and z touches the boundary of y).

Since z is entirely contained in y (TPP(z,y)), every point of z is a point of y. Given that x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), no point of x can be a point of y. Therefore, no point of x can be a point of z. 

Thus, the relationship between x and z must be that x and z are also disconnected.
