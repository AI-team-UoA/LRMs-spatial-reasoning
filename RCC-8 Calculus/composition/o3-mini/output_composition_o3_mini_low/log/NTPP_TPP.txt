PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two given relationships:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and does not touch y’s boundary.
2. TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary.

Since x ⊆ y and y ⊆ z, it follows that x is a proper part of z. However, whether x touches the boundary of z or not depends on how close x gets to the boundary of y (and thus of z) when y is placed in z.

Because x is an interior part of y (NTPP(x,y)) it may be placed in such a way that even though y touches the boundary of z, x remains entirely away from z’s boundary—in which case the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z). On the other hand, it is also possible for x to be located sufficiently near the part of y that contacts z’s boundary so that x too touches the boundary of z. In that situation the relation between x and z would be TPP(x,z).

Thus, given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z)
