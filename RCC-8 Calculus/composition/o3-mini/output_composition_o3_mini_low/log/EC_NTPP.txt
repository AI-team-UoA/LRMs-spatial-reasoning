PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the facts that

 • EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (i.e. they share some boundary but no interior points), and  
 • NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and y does not touch z’s boundary (that is, y lies entirely in the interior of z).

Because y is entirely inside z, its boundary (with which x is in contact) lies in the interior of z. Thus x must have a nonempty intersection with z (since at least it touches y, which is inside z). However, nothing forces x either to lie completely inside z or to share the full boundary structure of z – two general scenarios may occur:

1. x may be completely contained in z. In that case x is a proper part of z. Depending on whether x also touches z’s boundary or not, one obtains either TPP(x,z) (if x touches the boundary of z) or NTPP(x,z) (if x lies entirely in the interior of z).

2. Alternatively, x might not be a subset of z, even though it touches y (which is inside z). In that case x “straddles” the boundary of z so that part of x is in z and part is outside. This is exactly the PO(x,z) case.

Thus the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are PO, TPP, or NTPP.

### Answer: PO, TPP, and NTPP.
