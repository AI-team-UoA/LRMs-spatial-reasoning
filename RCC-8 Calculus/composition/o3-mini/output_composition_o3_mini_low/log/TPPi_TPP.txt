PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We begin with the information that TPPi(x,y) is defined as TPP(y,x). That is:

  TPPi(x,y) means y TPP x     (1)

and we are given

  TPP(y,z)        (2)

Recall that TPP(a,b) means that a is a proper (tangential) part of b (i.e. a ⊊ b, and a touches the boundary of b).

Thus we have y is a tangential proper part of both x and z:
  y ⊂ x  and y touches the boundary of x,
  y ⊂ z  and y touches the boundary of z.

Since y is a (non‐empty) region inside both x and z, it follows that x and z must share some common interior. Therefore, x and z cannot be disconnected (DC) nor externally connected (EC).

Now consider the possibilities for the relation between x and z:

1. It is possible that one of x and z is a proper part of the other. For example, if x is “just big enough” so that not only does it contain y, but x itself is entirely contained in z (with the appropriate boundary contact properties) then we would have TPP(x,z). Alternatively, if z ⊆ x in the same sense, then TPP(z,x) holds; writing this in the terminology of the RCC-8 we call that TPPi(x,z) (since TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x)).

2. It is also possible that x and z have a “mere” overlap: they are not in a proper part relation but nonetheless have a common part (namely y). In this situation the correct RCC-8 relation is PO(x,z) (“partial overlap”).

Thus, the three possibilities for the (RCC-8) relation between x and z are:

  • TPP(x,z)
  • TPPi(x,z)
  • PO(x,z)

We now provide the final combined answer.

### Answer:
TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z) or PO(x,z).
