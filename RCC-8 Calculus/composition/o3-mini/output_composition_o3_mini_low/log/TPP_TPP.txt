PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), we know that:

• x ⊂ y and x touches y’s boundary.
• y ⊂ z and y touches z’s boundary.

Because x is contained in y, and y is contained in z, it follows that x is contained in z. However, regarding the relationship between the boundaries of x and z, there are two possibilities:

1. x might touch the boundary of z. In this case, x would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).
2. Alternatively, x might lie entirely in the interior of z so that it does not contact z’s boundary. Then x would be a non‐tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

Thus, based on the TPP relations between x and y and between y and z, the possible relations between x and z are either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).
