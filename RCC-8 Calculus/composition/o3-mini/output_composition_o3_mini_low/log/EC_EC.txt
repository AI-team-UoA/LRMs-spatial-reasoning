PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We can show that, under the RCC‐8 definitions, if x is externally connected to y and y is externally connected to z, then a number of spatial configurations for x and z are possible. In particular, x and z might not touch at all, they might touch only at their boundaries, or they might even share some interior part. In RCC‐8 terms, these possibilities are captured by the relations DC, EC, and PO.

To explain briefly:
 • DC (Disconnected) is possible when the “chain” of EC contacts does not “propagate” into a contact between x and z.
 • EC (Externally Connected) can occur if the touching boundaries “link up” so that x and z just touch.
 • PO (Partially Overlapping) is possible if the boundary contacts lead to a configuration in which portions of the regions overlap (i.e. they share some parts) even though neither is a proper part of the other.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are given by DC, EC, and PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, and PO.
