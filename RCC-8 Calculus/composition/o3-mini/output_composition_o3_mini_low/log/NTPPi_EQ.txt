PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given relation NTPPi(x, y), which by definition is equivalent to NTPP(y, x) (i.e. y is a non‚Äêtangential proper part of x). We also have EQ(y, z), meaning that y and z are spatially identical. Replacing y with z in the relation NTPP(y, x) gives NTPP(z, x). By the definition of NTPPi, which is the inverse of NTPP, we can say that NTPP(z, x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x, z).

Therefore, if NTPPi(x, y) and EQ(y, z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x, z)
