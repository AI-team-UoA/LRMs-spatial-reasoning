PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that TPPi(x,y) is defined as TPP(y,x), we know that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e. y is contained in x, and y touches x’s boundary). We are also told that DC(y,z), meaning y and z share no common parts (they are disconnected).

We must now determine what spatial relations between x and z are compatible with these two facts.

Let’s examine the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): It is possible that x and z are completely disconnected. In this case, since y ⊆ x, y remains inside x and thus is also separated from z. So x DC z is consistent with DC(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): Suppose x and z touch at a boundary but do not “overlap” in their interiors. In many configurations the portion of x that contains y can avoid the contact zone with z. In other words, even if x and z touch externally, y (which is completely inside x with part of its boundary on x’s boundary) can be positioned wholly away from the contact area so that y and z remain disconnected. Therefore, x EC z is also possible.

3. PO(x,z): In a partial overlap scenario, x and z have some common interior region yet neither completely contains the other. Because y is only one part of x, it is possible to have the overlapping region arranged in such a way that y does not intersect with z. For instance, x might overlap with z in a region that lies apart from where y is located. Thus, x PO z is also compatible with y being disconnected from z.

Other RCC-8 relations that involve containment (like TPP, NTPP, and their converses) or equality are not consistent since they would force either an overlap or inclusion relationship that, given y ⊆ x, would make achieving DC(y,z) problematic.

Thus, the only three relations for x and z that can be consistent with TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:

DC, EC, and PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, and PO.
