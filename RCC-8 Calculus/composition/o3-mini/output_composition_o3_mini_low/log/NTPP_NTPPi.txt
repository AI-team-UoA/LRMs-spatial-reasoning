PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x,y) means “x is a non‐tangential proper part of y” and that NTPPi(y,z) is defined as NTPP(z,y)’s converse – which in effect means “y is a non‐tangential proper part of z” – we have the following chain:
  x NTPP y and y NTPP z.

By the standard composition properties in the RCC-8 calculus, if x is a non‐tangential proper part of y and y is a non‐tangential proper part of z, then x is a non‐tangential proper part of z. That is, the relationship between x and z must be:

  NTPP(x,z).

Thus, there is a unique answer.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
