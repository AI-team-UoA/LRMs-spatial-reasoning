PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two given facts:

 • EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (their boundaries touch but they do not share any interior).
 • PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some interior parts but neither is completely contained in the other).

Our task is to deduce what may be said about the relation between x and z.

A heuristic way to think about the situation is to “chain” the information. x touches y at its boundary and y shares some interior with z; hence, x may have some kind of indirect connection to z, though the exact nature of the connection depends on how the regions are arranged.

Consider the following possibilities:
 1. It is possible that x lies “outside of” z with no contact whatsoever. For example, if the touching part of x with y is on the portion of y that does not overlap with z, then x and z can be completely disconnected (DC).
 2. Alternatively, the part of y that is in contact with x might be “near” the part of y that overlaps with z so that x may end up touching z (but without any interior sharing). In that case x and z could be externally connected (EC).
 3. Finally, if x is arranged so that the part of y that touches x overlaps with z’s interior, then x may “inherit” some of that interior overlap with z. Then x and z would partially overlap (PO).

According to studies of compositions of RCC‐8 relations, the composition of EC (for x with some intermediate y) and PO (for that y with z) indeed yields as possible outcomes the relations DC, EC, and PO.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are:

 DC, EC, and PO.
