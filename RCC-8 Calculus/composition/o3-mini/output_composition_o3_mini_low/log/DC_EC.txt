PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given conditions: DC(x,y) tells us that x and y have no spatial overlap whatsoever, and EC(y,z) tells us that y and z share a boundary point (but no interior points). Under these conditions, when considering the possible spatial relationships between x and z, we have to see how the lack of contact between x and y and the boundary contact between y and z can “propagate” to x and z.

A standard result in RCC‑8 qualitative spatial reasoning is that the composition of DC with EC (i.e. DC ∘ EC) can yield three different kinds of relations between x and z. Concretely, based on the RCC‑8 composition table, if we know DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then the relationship between x and z can be one of:
  • DC(x,z)
  • EC(x,z)
  • PO(x,z)

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, or PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, and PO.
