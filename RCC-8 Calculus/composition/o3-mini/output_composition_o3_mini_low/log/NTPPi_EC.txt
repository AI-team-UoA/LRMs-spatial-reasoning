PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two assertions:
 • NTPPi(x,y) is defined to mean the inverse of NTPP(x,y); that is, it means NTPP(y,x): y is a non‐tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and its boundary does not touch x’s boundary.
 • EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected; they touch at a boundary but do not share any interior.

Now, since y is completely inside x (without touching x’s boundary) and y touches z at its boundary, we have to “propagate” this information to the relationship between x and z. Intuitively, the fact that an “interior bit” of x (namely, y) touches z means that z must either “just meet” x (i.e. be externally connected to it) or “reach into” x so that some of x’s interior is shared with z (yielding a partial overlap). In addition, it is also possible that the only contact between x and z occurs via the region y such that z does not “really” invade x; that is, z might be completely outside x except for “kissing” it at the part near y, in which case x and z are externally connected. If z does “invade” x then x and z share some interior points, giving the PO (partial overlap) relation. Finally, it is also possible that z misses x entirely (although still touching y, since y is properly “inside” x, this forces z eventually to meet x’s boundary – see below).

More carefully, since y is entirely inside x, any contact between y and z forces a contact between x and z (because the contact point on the boundary of y is “deep” inside x – away from x’s own boundary – so if z touches that point then z must bump against x too). However, the way in which z touches that “inner‐cell” of x may be such that z “clips” the boundary of x (yielding EC between x and z) or intrudes in further so that x and z share interior points (which is the PO relation between x and z).

Now, a detailed look at the RCC‑8 composition tables (which have been thoroughly studied in qualitative spatial reasoning) shows that when you “compose” a NTPP (or its inverse NTPPi) with an EC relation the only admissible outcomes for the relation between x and z are
  • DC (disconnected),
  • EC (externally connected), or
  • PO (partial overlap).

Thus, the final answer is that if NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then the possible relationships between x and z are either DC, EC, or PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, or PO.
