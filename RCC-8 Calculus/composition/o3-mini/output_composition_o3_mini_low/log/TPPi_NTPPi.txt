PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start by unpacking the given relations.

1. TPPi(x, y) is defined as TPP(y, x). So we know that y is a tangential proper part of x: y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of x.

2. NTPPi(y, z) is defined as NTPP(z, y). This means that z is a non‐tangential proper part of y: z ⊂ y and, importantly, z does not touch the boundary of y.

Now, since z ⊂ y and y ⊂ x, we certainly have that z ⊂ x (i.e. z is a proper part of x). However, what kind of proper part is z of x?

Because y touches the boundary of x, z might either:
 • lie entirely inside x so that it does not touch x’s boundary, or
 • be “close to” the portion of y that contacts x’s boundary, in which case z could touch the boundary of x.

In the first instance, z would be a non‐tangential proper part of x (NTPP(x, z)). In the second instance, z would be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(x, z)).

Thus, given the stated information, the relationship between x and z can be either TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z).

### Answer: TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z)
