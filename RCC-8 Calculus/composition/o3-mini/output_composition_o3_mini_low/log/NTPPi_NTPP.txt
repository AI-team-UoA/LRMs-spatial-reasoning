PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two facts:

 • NTPPi(x,y) by definition is equivalent to NTPP(y,x) (that is, y is a non‐tangential proper part of x).  
 • NTPP(y,z) (that is, y is a non‐tangential proper part of z).

Recall that “NTPP(a,b)” means that a is a proper part of b in such a way that the boundary of a does not touch the boundary of b.

Thus, we have y ⊂ x (with y placed “well inside” x) and also y ⊂ z (with y placed “well inside” z). Since the region y is a non‐tangential proper part of both x and z it must lie in the interior of both x and z. Consequently, x and z must “overlap” at least on the region that contains y.

What then are the possible spatial relations between x and z? There are three possibilities:

1. x is a non‐tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z));  
2. z is a non‐tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z) – which, by definition, is the same as NTPP(z,x));  
3. x and z overlap so that neither is a proper part of the other (PO(x,z)).

There is no possibility for x and z to be disconnected or merely touching (EC), for example, because they share an “inner” part y. They also cannot be equal because proper‐part relations are strict.

Thus, the final answer is:

### Answer:
The relation between x and z may be NTPP(x,z), or NTPP(z,x) (i.e. NTPPi(x,z)), or PO(x,z).
