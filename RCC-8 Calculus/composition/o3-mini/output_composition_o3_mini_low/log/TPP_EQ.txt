PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x, y) (x is a tangential proper part of y) and EQ(y, z) (y and z are identical), we can substitute y with z and conclude that x is a tangential proper part of z.

Since TPP(x, y) means that x is part of y and touches y’s boundary, when y = z, it directly follows that x is part of z and touches z’s boundary. There is no other relation in RCC-8 that captures this specific scenario.

### Answer: TPP(x, z)
