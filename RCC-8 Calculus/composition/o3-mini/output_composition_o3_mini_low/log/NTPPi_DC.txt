PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given facts:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x); that is, y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (so y is entirely inside x and does not touch x’s boundary).

2. DC(y,z) means y and z are “disconnected” (no points in common).

Now consider x and z. Since y ⊆ interior(x) and yet y ∩ z = ∅, whatever x and z do must “avoid” y. In other words, any intersection between x and z must come from parts of x that lie outside y.

A few scenarios are possible:

• Case 1. x and z do not meet at all. Then clearly x and z are disconnected, i.e. DC(x,z).

• Case 2. x and z meet only on their boundaries. Then x and z are externally connected, i.e. EC(x,z).

• Case 3. x and z share some interior points (that is, they overlap) but not in such a way that one is contained in the other. (Notice that if one were contained in the other then—since y ⊆ x or y ⊆ z—the fact that y and z are disjoint would be violated.) Thus the only possible overlapping relation is PO(x,z).

No other RCC‐8 relation is admissible in this situation because:
– If x were a proper part of z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)) then, since y ⊂ x, we would have y ⊆ z, contradicting DC(y,z).
– Similarly, if z were a proper part of x then again (by similar reasoning) y would have to intersect z.

Thus the possible RCC‐8 relationships between x and z are only DC, EC, and PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, or PO.
