PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We begin with the premises:
 • EC(x, y): x and y “touch” – they share a boundary point but have no common interior.
 • DC(y, z): y and z are completely separated (disconnected), sharing no point or boundary.

Now, consider a potential configuration. Since x is externally connected with y, x “wraps around” y at least partly or “kisses” y at its boundary. Meanwhile, y is entirely apart from z. Depending on how x extends in space, there are two main possibilities regarding the relation between x and z:
 1. x may remain completely separated from z, leading to DC(x, z). This happens when the part of x that touches y does not extend far enough to “reach” z.
 2. Alternatively, x may “stretch” beyond y such that its boundary touches z. In that case, x and z would be externally connected, i.e. EC(x, z).

There is no way given the information for x and z to partially overlap (PO) or for one to be a tangential proper part of the other (TPP or NTPP) because y, which x touches, is already disjoint from z, and no part of x is forced to lie inside z.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x, z) or EC(x, z).

### Answer: DC(x, z) or EC(x, z)
