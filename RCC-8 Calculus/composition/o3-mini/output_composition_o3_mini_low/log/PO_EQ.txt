PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is a spatial part of the other. EQ(y,z) tells us that y and z are exactly the same object. Therefore, substituting z for y in the relation PO(x,y) we obtain PO(x,z).

Since the definitions are precise and there is no additional nuance introduced by having y equal to z, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z)
