PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EC(x, y) means that x and y touch (their boundaries touch, with no overlapping interiors) and EQ(y, z) means that y and z are identical, replacing y by z in the first relation shows that x and z must be externally connected. 

Thus, the possible relationship between x and z is:
