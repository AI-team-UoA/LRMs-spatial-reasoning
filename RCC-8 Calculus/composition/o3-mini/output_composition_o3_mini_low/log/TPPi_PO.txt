PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two given facts:

 • TPPi(x,y) means, by definition, that TPP(y,x). In words, y is a proper part of x (y ⊂ x) and touches x’s boundary.

 • PO(y,z) means y and z “partially overlap” – they share some, but not all, of their interior parts (and neither is a proper part of the other).

Now, because y ⊆ x (with contact at x’s boundary) and y overlaps z, we know that y is a non‐empty “witness” to the intersection of x and z. In particular, x and z must share at least the interior of y.

The key point is that if one of x or z were entirely contained in the other then y—being completely within the container—would be in a proper part relation with that region (TPP or NTPP, possibly with the inverse for the other), and PO (partial overlap) would not hold for y and z. (Recall that PO excludes the possibility that one region is a proper part of the other.)

Thus, neither x ⊆ z (or x being a proper part of z) nor z ⊆ x can occur. Also, since they intersect in a “strong” way (sharing an interior region that is at least y) their relationship cannot be described only as “touching” (EC). They are not identical (EQ) because then y would be a proper part of z, again contradicting the stated PO between y and z.

The only remaining RCC‑8 relation between x and z is PO, meaning that x and z partially overlap.

So, given TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), the only possible relation between x and z is:

  PO(x,z)

### Answer: PO(x,z)
