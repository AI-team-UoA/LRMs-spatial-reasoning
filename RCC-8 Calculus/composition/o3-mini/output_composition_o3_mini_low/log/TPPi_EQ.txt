PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that TPPi(x, y) is defined as TPP(y, x) (meaning y is a tangential proper part of x) and that EQ(y, z) means y and z are identical, we can substitute z for y. This gives TPP(z, x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x, z).

### Answer: TPPi(x, z)
