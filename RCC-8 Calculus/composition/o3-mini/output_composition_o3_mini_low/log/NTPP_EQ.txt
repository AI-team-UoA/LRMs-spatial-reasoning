PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x, y) means that x is a non‐tangential proper part of y (i.e. x is contained in y but does not reach y’s boundary), and EQ(y, z) means that y and z are exactly the same region, we can substitute z for y in the first relation. This directly leads us to conclude that x is a non‐tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x, z).

### Answer: NTPP(x, z)
