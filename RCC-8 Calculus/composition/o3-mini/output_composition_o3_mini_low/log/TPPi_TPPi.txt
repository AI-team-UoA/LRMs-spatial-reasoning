PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the two premises. Recall that by definition:

• TPP(x,y) means “x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary.”
• TPPi(x,y) is defined to be equivalent to TPP(y,x) – that is, y is a proper part of x and touches x’s boundary.

Thus, stating TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e. y ⊂ x and y touches x’s boundary). Similarly, TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

Now we can “chain” the information:

1. From TPPi(x,y): y is properly contained in x and meets the boundary of x.
2. From TPPi(y,z): z is properly contained in y and meets the boundary of y.

Since z ⊂ y and y ⊂ x, transitivity of “part‐of” tells us that z is a proper part of x. However, regarding whether z touches the boundary of x or not, we have two possibilities. Depending on the exact spatial configuration, the following cases may occur:

A. z touches the boundary of x. In that case, when we express the relation using the inverse of TPP we say TPPi(x,z) (i.e. z is a tangential proper part of x).

B. z does not touch the boundary of x (despite touching the boundary of y). Then, z is a non‐tangential proper part of x, written as NTPPi(x,z) (which means NTPP(x,z), i.e. z is a non‐tangential proper part of x).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are that z is either a tangential proper part of x or a non‐tangential proper part of x.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z)
