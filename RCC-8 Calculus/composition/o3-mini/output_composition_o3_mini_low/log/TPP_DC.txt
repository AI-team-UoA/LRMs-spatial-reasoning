PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y sharing part of yâ€™s boundary. Also, DC(y,z) tells us that y and z are disconnected (they share no points, including boundaries). Since x is completely contained in y, any contact (or potential contact) between x and z would imply some contact between y and z (at least indirectly) which contradicts DC(y,z). Therefore, x and z must also be disconnected. 

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is:

### Answer: DC(x,z)
