PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start by noting that NTPPi is defined as the inverse of NTPP. That is,
  NTPPi(x, y) means exactly that NTPP(y, x) holds (y is a non‐tangent proper part of x).

Given the two conditions:
  (1) NTPPi(x, y) ⟹ NTPP(y, x)     (y is a non‐tangent proper part of x)
  (2) NTPPi(y, z) ⟹ NTPP(z, y)     (z is a non‐tangent proper part of y)

We then have a chain of part relations:
  z is a non‐tangent proper part of y, and y is a non‐tangent proper part of x.

By the transitivity of a “non‐tangent proper part” relation (i.e. if z ⊂ y and y ⊂ x in a “well inside” manner, then z ⊂ x in the same “well inside” way), it follows that:
  z is a non‐tangent proper part of x,
or equivalently, in our terminology,
  NTPP(z, x) holds.

Expressing this in the inverse form (to match the pattern used in the question), we have:
  NTPPi(x, z) (which means NTPP(z, x)).

Thus, the only possible spatial relationship between x and z, given the premises, is that z is a non‐tangent proper part of x (or equivalently, x and z are in the relationship NTPPi(x, z)).

### Answer: NTPPi(x, z)
