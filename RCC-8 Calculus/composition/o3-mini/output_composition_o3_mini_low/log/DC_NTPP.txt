PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given facts:
 • DC(x,y): Regions x and y are disconnected (i.e. they have no point in common).
 • NTPP(y,z): Region y is a proper (non‐tangential) part of z (so y is inside z and does not even meet z’s boundary).

Given these, we must “compose” the two relations to ask what relationship between x and z is forced by the combination.

Intuitively, here’s one way to think about it. Since y is entirely (and “safely”) inside z, and since x does not meet y at all, there is room for various spatial “arrangements” of x relative to z. For example:

1. x might lie completely outside z so that even though y is inside z, x and z are completely separate. In that case the relation is DC(x,z).

2. x might “just touch” z on its boundary even while staying clear of y. Then x and z are externally connected (EC).

3. x might “graze” into the interior of z (thus meeting a portion of z) without enclosing any big part of z. In other words, x and z might partially overlap (PO).

4. Alternatively, it could happen that x falls entirely inside z. In that case there are two possibilities:
  a. x might meet the boundary of z (making x a tangential proper part of z – TPP), or
  b. x might lie completely away from the boundary of z (making x a non‐tangential proper part – NTPP).

Thus by considering the different ways one can “place” x relative both to the interior region z (which contains y) and the location of y, we obtain that the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:

  DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP

We note that no other relation (e.g. any “inverse” proper part relation or equality) is possible given these assumptions.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
