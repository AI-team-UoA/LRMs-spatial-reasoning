PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that

  PO(x,y)    (x and y “partially overlap” – they share some but not all parts, and neither contains the other), and
  NTPPi(y,z)   (y is a non‐tangential proper part of z, i.e. y ⊆ z, in fact y is “deeply inside” z, not touching z’s boundary).

Because y is a proper part of z, every part of y falls well inside z. Now, since x PO y, the regions x and y share some common interior, and thus x has some area that lies inside y ⊆ z. However, we have no further “containment” restriction on x relative to y; in particular, x may extend outside of y. This leaves us with two potential scenarios regarding x and z:

1. It is possible that x, while overlapping y, is not entirely contained in z. In this case x “sticks out” of z. Then, x and z themselves will be overlapping (sharing a part but with neither completely inside the other) – that is, PO(x,z).

2. Alternatively, x might be placed so that it is entirely contained within z. (It is important to note that x cannot be completely inside y since PO forbids a full part–whole relation between x and y; however, x might still be situated inside z while only partly overlapping y.) In that case, x is a proper part of z. Then it could happen in one of two ways:
  a. x touches the boundary of z (so that the interior of x meets the boundary of z) – which gives TPP(x,z), or
  b. x is completely “internal” to z (its boundary does not touch z’s boundary) – which gives NTPP(x,z).

Thus, in summary the possible RCC‑8 relations between x and z are:

  PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

We now give the final answer in the requested format.

### Answer: PO, TPP, or NTPP
