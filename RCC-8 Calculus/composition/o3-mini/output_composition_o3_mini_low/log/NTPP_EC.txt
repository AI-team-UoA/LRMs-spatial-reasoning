PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the following given facts: x NTPP y and y EC z.

Recall that:
• NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and x does not touch the boundary of y; in other words, the entire closure of x is contained in the interior of y.
• EC(y,z) means that y and z touch one another along their boundaries, yet they do not share any interior points.

Because x is “well inside” y (its closure lies entirely in the interior of y), it cannot possibly “reach” the boundary of y where y meets z. Thus, x is spatially separated from z. In terms of the RCC-8 relations, this is precisely the condition for DC(x,z) (“disconnected”).

Therefore, given that x is a non‐touching proper part of y and y meets z only at its boundary, x must be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
