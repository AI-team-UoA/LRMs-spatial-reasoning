PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given:

1. EC(x,y): x and y share a boundary point but their interiors do not intersect.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a (tangential) proper part of z (i.e. y is contained in z, and y touches z’s boundary).

We want to know which RCC‑8 relation(s) can hold between x and z under these conditions. Let’s think about the possible spatial configurations.

Since y is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary, some part of y comes in contact with z’s boundary. Now, x externally connects to y. That is, x and y meet at some boundary point of y and have no overlapping interior. There are several ways x can be arranged relative to z:

• Configuration 1: x touches y at a boundary point that, because y touches z’s boundary, lies on z’s boundary. In this case x and z share a boundary point without having any interior overlap. Hence, x and z are externally connected, i.e. EC(x,z).

• Configuration 2: x touches y, and x extends so that part of x lies inside z and part lies outside z. In that case x and z will have a non‐empty intersection of their interiors (the part of x inside z) but neither will be completely contained in the other. This is the partial overlap relation, PO(x,z).

• Configuration 3: x touches y in such a way that x lies entirely within z but still touches z’s boundary (via the contact with y which in turn touches z’s boundary). In this situation x is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary, i.e. TPP(x,z).

Thus, given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the relationship between x and z could be any one of the following RCC‑8 relations: EC, PO, or TPP.

### Answer: EC, PO, and TPP.
