PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x, y) means x and y are identical, any spatial relation that holds between y and another region z will equally hold between x and z. In this case, since PO(y, z) tells us that y and z share some but not all parts (and neither region is completely contained in the other), the same relationship will necessarily hold between x and z. 

### Answer: PO(x, z)
