PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since DC(x, y) means that x and y are completely separated (sharing no points at all) and NTPPi(y, z) means (by definition) that NTPP(z, y) holds—i.e. z is a non‐tangential proper part of y (z is completely contained within y and does not touch the boundary)—any part of y, including z, will also be spatially separated from x. In other words, if x does not touch any part of y, then x cannot come into contact with any region that is fully inside y.

Thus, the only possible spatial relation between x and z is DC.
