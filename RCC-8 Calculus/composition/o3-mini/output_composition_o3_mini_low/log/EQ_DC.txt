PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(x, y) indicates that x and y are exactly the same region, any spatial relationship that holds for y with any region z must also hold for x with z. Here, we are given DC(y, z) (x is disconnected from z), which means that y and z do not share any spatial parts. Therefore, x, being identical to y, must also be disconnected from z. 

### Answer: DC
