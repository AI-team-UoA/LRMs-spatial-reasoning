PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Consider that TPP(x,y) tells us x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary, while EC(y,z) tells us that y and z share a boundary without overlapping interiors. Since x lies within y, the way x relates to z depends on its placement inside y:

1. It is possible that even though x touches y’s boundary, the part of y’s boundary that x touches is not the part adjacent to z. In that case, there is no contact between x and z and we have DC(x,z) (they are disconnected).

2. Alternatively, if x is arranged so that the boundary it touches is exactly the part where y abuts z, then x will also share a boundary with z; that is, EC(x,z).

Thus the possible relationships between x and z are either DC or EC.

### Answer: DC and EC
