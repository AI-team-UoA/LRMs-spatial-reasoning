PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Let’s begin by “translating” the two given relations into the standard interpretation of proper‐part:

• NTPPi(x, y) means, by definition, that NTPP(y, x) holds. In words, y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (y is properly inside x without touching x’s boundary).

• TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y) (that is, by inversion, z is a tangential proper part of y: z is properly inside y and touches y’s boundary).

Now, from these two facts we have the situation (with set inclusion thinking in mind): 

  z ⊆ y ⊆ x

and we know more about how y sits inside x: y is a non‐tangential proper part of x. That is, the closure of y is a subset of the interior of x. Consequently, no part of y (and hence of any subset of y) reaches x’s boundary.

Since z ⊆ y and z is a tangential proper part of y, z may touch the boundary of y. However, because the entire y (including its closure) lies strictly inside x (i.e. does not reach x’s boundary), even if z touches the boundary of y it still remains entirely in the interior of x. In other words, z is a proper part of x that does not reach x’s boundary.

Thus the relation between x and z must be that z is a non‐tangential proper part of x, i.e. NTPP(x, z).

So, the final answer is:

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
