PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We begin with the following assumptions:
 • PO(x,y) means x and y share some parts but neither is completely contained in the other.
 • NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z (so y is strictly inside z).

Because x overlaps y (and x is not a subset of y) and y is completely inside z, we know that at least part of x must be inside z (namely the portion common with y). However, x is not known to be completely contained in y. Thus, there are two broad cases to consider:

1. x is entirely contained in z.  
 a. If the entire x is in z and x touches the boundary of z then we have TPP(x,z) (“tangential proper part”).  
 b. If the entire x is in z but does not reach z’s boundary then we have NTPP(x,z) (“non‐tangential proper part”).

2. x is not entirely contained in z. In this case, some part of x lies outside z. But because x shares some part (namely the y part) with z, the relationship is not one of disjointness or inclusion. Thus, we have PO(x,z).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z)
