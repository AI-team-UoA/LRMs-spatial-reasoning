PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We first note that the given relations are defined as follows:

• EC(x,y): x and y share a boundary point (touching) but do not overlap (no interior parts in common).

• TPPi(y,z): by definition, TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), so TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). In words, TPP(z,y) means that z is a tangential proper part of y; that is, z is completely contained in y, and at least one boundary point of z also lies on the boundary of y.

Now, assume we have EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (i.e. TPP(z,y)). This sets up the following picture: x touches y (sharing at least one boundary point) but does not have any interior points in common with y. At the same time, z is completely contained in y (with z touching y’s boundary).

Since z ⊆ y and the interior of z is a subset of the interior of y, x (which has no interior contact with y) cannot have an overlap with the interior of z. However, there are two possibilities for any contact between x and z:

1. It may be that x does not touch z at all. That is, while x touches y, the point of contact is not “close enough” to include any of the boundary of z. In this case x and z share no point and are disconnected: DC(x,z).

2. Alternatively, it may happen that the boundary of z (which touches y’s boundary) coincides with the point (or region) where x touches y. In that case x and z would share that boundary, so they would be externally connected: EC(x,z).

Because x’s relation to y (EC) does not force an interior overlap and z is entirely within y, no other relation (like PO) is possible between x and z.

Thus, the only two possibilities for the relationship between x and z are DC (Disconnected) or EC (Externally Connected).
