PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that

 • NTPPi(x,y) means by definition that NTPP(y,x) holds; that is, y is a non‐tangential proper part of x (y is strictly inside x, not touching its boundary).

 • TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z’s boundary).

Now, from these assumptions we know that y is a (non‐tangential) part of x and at the same time a part of z, where its being a tangential part of z means it reaches the boundary of z. However, nothing forces the whole of x either to lie entirely within z (in which case x would be a proper part of z) or for it to lie partly outside z. In fact, different configurations are possible. For example:

1. It may be that x lies entirely inside z. In that case, because y is “deep” inside x (since y does not touch the boundary of x) there is no obligation that x also avoids z’s boundary. In such a situation x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) if x touches z’s boundary, or even a non‐tangential proper part (NTPP(x,z)) if x stays in the interior of z.

2. It may be that x is not completely contained in z. In that case x and z will share y, so they will overlap (sharing some part, namely y, yet neither is a subset of the other). That is, x and z then are in the PO (partial overlap) relation.

Thus, based on the composition of the given relations the relation between x and z can be one of the following possibilities:
 • NTPP(x,z)
 • TPP(x,z)
 • PO(x,z)

In our answer we list these three possibilities.

### Answer:
The possible relationships are NTPP, TPP, or PO between x and z.
