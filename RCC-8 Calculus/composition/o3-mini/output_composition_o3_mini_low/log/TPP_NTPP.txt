PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that TPP(x, y) means x is a proper part of y (with x touching y’s boundary) and NTPP(y, z) means y is a proper part of z without touching z’s boundary, we examine what happens when these are composed.

1. Since TPP(x, y) holds, we have x ⊆ y and x touches y’s boundary.
2. Since NTPP(y, z) holds, we have y ⊆ z and, importantly, all points of y (including its boundary) are in the interior of z.
3. Thus, x ⊆ y ⊆ z, so x is a part of z for sure.
4. Now, note that because y is entirely within the interior of z, none of its points (and, by inclusion, none of x’s points even if they come from the part of y that touches its boundary) can lie on z’s boundary. This means that x cannot be touching z’s boundary.
5. Consequently, even though x touches y’s boundary, in z it is strictly enclosed without contact with z’s boundary.

So, we conclude that x is a proper part of z that does not touch its boundary, i.e. NTPP(x, z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
