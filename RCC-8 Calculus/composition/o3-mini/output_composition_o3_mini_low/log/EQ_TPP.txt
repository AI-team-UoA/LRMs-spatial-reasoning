PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical, any relation that holds between y and z must also hold between x and z. Given TPP(y,z) (y is a tangential proper part of z), we can conclude directly that x (being the same as y) is also a tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
