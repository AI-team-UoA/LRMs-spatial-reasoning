PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We know that EQ(x, y) means that x and y are exactly identical. In addition, we are given TPPi(y, z). By definition TPPi(y, z) is just another way of saying TPP(z, y) (i.e. z is a tangential proper part of y). Since x is identical to y, we can substitute to obtain TPP(z, x). Now, recalling the definitions, TPP(z, x) indicates that z is a tangential proper part of x, which by definition is the same relation as TPPi(x, z).

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e. TPPi(x, z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
