PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are identical, we can substitute x for y. Therefore, if NTPP(y,z) holds (i.e. y is a non‚Äêtangential proper part of z), then replacing y with x immediately gives NTPP(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
