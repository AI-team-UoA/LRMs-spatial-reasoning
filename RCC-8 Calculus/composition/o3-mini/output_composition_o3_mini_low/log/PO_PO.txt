PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The answer is not unique. Several RCC‐8 relations might hold between x and z when we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). In fact, it is known that the composition of PO with PO yields the following possible relations between x and z:
  DC, EC, PO, TPP, its converse TPPi, NTPP, and its converse NTPPi.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, NTPPi.
