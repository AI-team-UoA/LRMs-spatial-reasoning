PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that:
  • EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they share a common boundary but their interiors do not overlap.
  • NTPPi(y,z): by definition NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y); that is, z is a non‐tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is entirely within y and does not touch y’s boundary.

Since z is wholly contained in the interior of y and does not reach y’s boundary, and x only touches y’s boundary (and does not share any interior with y), it is impossible for x to touch or overlap z. Therefore, the only relation that holds between x and z is that they are disconnected.
