PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that x is a non‚Äêtangential proper part of y (NTPP(x, y), meaning x lies entirely inside y without touching its boundary) and y is disconnected from z (DC(y, z), meaning y and z share no parts), it follows that x, as a subset of y, is also entirely separate from z. In other words, x cannot share a boundary or interior with z because y does not. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is that they are disconnected.
