PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We begin with the premises:

 • PO(x, y): x and y overlap. That is, x and y share some, but not all, parts; in particular, neither is wholly contained in the other.

 • DC(y, z): y and z are disconnected—they share no common point.

Now, consider what this means for x and z. Although x partially overlaps y, the part of x that lies inside y is “shielded” by y from relating to z since y and z are entirely separate. However, x might extend beyond y. That extra‐x outside y may or may not interact with z. Hence, we have two main possibilities for the relation between x and z:

1. If the entire x (including any part potentially outside y) does not meet z at all then x and z are DC (Disconnected).

2. If some part outside of y touches or even intersects z, then the relationship between x and z could be one of:
  – EC (Externally Connected), if x and z share a boundary point but do not have overlapping interiors; or
  – PO (Partially Overlapping), if x and z share some interior parts (but neither is completely contained in the other).

Thus, there is no possibility for a containment relation (TPP or NTPP or their inverses) or for equality, because the PO(x, y) already establishes that x and y share parts and neither is wholly contained in the other, and y is DC from z.

So all possible answers for the relation between x and z are: DC, EC, or PO.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO
