PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non‐tangential proper part of y (so x is contained completely in the interior of y), and that TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to y TPP z (which means that y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is contained in z but touches z’s boundary), we can chain the relations as follows:

1. From NTPP(x,y) we have x ⊂ y and the boundary of x does not meet the boundary of y.
2. From y TPP z we have y ⊂ z and y touches z’s boundary.

Thus, by transitivity, x is a proper part of z. However, regarding whether x touches the boundary of z, two situations may occur:

• It is possible that x, while being completely “inside” y, is positioned so that it does not reach z’s boundary (because even though y touches z’s boundary, x could be well separated from that part of y). In this case x would be a non‐tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

• Alternatively, x might be located near the part of y that touches z’s boundary. Then x’s boundary may also come into contact with z’s boundary, making x a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

Thus, given the information we have, the possible relationships between x and z are either NTPP or TPP.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z) or TPP(x,z)
