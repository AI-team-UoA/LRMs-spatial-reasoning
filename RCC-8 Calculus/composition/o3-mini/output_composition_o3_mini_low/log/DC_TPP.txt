PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We are given that:

• DC(x,y): x is disconnected from y (they share no common point)  
• TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z’s boundary

Now, we wish to deduce what relation(s) may hold between x and z.

Let us think of an intuitive scenario. Picture y as a “small” region that lies within (and touches the boundary of) a larger region z. Now x is disjoint from y (DC(x,y)), so no point of x lies in y. However, x could be placed in various positions relative to z. For example:

1. x might lie completely outside z so that it does not touch z at all. Then x and z are disconnected (DC).

2. x could lie immediately outside but touching the boundary of z. Then x and z would be externally connected (EC).

3. x might overlap with z, in such a way that it shares interior points with z but is not a subregion of z. Then the relation is “partial overlap” (PO).

4. It is also possible that x falls entirely within z. In that case, x is a proper part of z. Depending on whether x touches the boundary of z or not, the relation is either TPP (if x touches z’s boundary) or NTPP (if x is entirely within the interior of z).

Notice that all these possibilities are consistent with x being disconnected from y (since y is only part of z and x might intersect the rest of z without ever meeting y).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are:
 • DC(x,z)  
 • EC(x,z)  
 • PO(x,z)  
 • TPP(x,z)  
 • NTPP(x,z)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z)
