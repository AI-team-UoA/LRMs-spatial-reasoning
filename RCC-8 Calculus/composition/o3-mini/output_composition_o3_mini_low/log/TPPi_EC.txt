PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

We start with the given assumptions. Recall that

• TPP(x,y) means “x is a proper part of y and touches y’s boundary,” and  
• TPPi(x,y) is defined as TPP(y,x), so TPPi(x,y) means “y is a proper part of x and touches x’s boundary.”

Also,  
• EC(u,v) means that regions u and v have no interior in common but do touch at a boundary.

Now, suppose we are given that
  (1) TPPi(x,y)  (which is the same as TPP(y,x)) and  
  (2) EC(y,z).

From (1) we know that y is a proper part of x. Importantly, since y is “tangential” inside x, it touches the boundary of x. In other words, y lies inside x and bumps right up against the limit of x.

From (2) we know that y and z touch at a boundary (and by EC they do not share any interior).

Because y is both a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x, the place where y touches z is “near” the boundary of x. This means that z must come into contact with x as well. However, the way z meets x is not entirely forced:
 • In one scenario, z might lie entirely outside x except for a “bit of a touch” at that boundary point. In that case x and z merely share a common boundary point and are externally connected: EC(x,z).
 • In another scenario, z might extend so that part of its interior overlaps with x (even if only tangentially near the boundary where y touches z). Then x and z share some (though not all) interior, which is the PO (partial overlap) situation in RCC‑8.

On the basis of these possibilities, the RCC‑8 reasoning tells us that the relationship between x and z is not uniquely determined by the facts TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z). Rather, one may only conclude that x and z are either externally connected (EC) or partially overlapping (PO).

Thus, the final answer is:

### Answer: EC or PO.
