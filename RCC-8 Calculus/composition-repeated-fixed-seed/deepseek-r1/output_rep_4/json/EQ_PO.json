{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident (identical regions). Given PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap: they share some spatial parts but neither is a subset of the other. Since x and y are identical, the relationship between x and z must be identical to that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation is PO(x,z).\n\n### Answer: PO", "elapsed-time": 22.388412952423096, "reasoning-tokens": 301, "completion-tokens": 382}
