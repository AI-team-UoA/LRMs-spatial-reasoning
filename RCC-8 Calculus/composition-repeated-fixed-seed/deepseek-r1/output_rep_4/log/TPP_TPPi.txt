PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y), both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. The possible relationships between x and z are those consistent with both being tangential to y's boundary.

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected - x and z share no common points.  
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected - x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.  
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap - x and z share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part - x is a tangential proper part of z.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse tangential proper part - z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal - x and z are the same region.  

The relations NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because if one region were a non-tangential proper part of the other, it would not touch y's boundary, contradicting the given tangential proper part relations with y.

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
