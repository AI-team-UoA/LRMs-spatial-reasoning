PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations allowed by the RCC-8 calculus. EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected (they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts), and PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other).

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This occurs if z is positioned such that it does not intersect or touch x, for example, if z overlaps y on the side opposite to where x is connected.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs if z overlaps y near the boundary where x and y touch, causing x and z to share a boundary point.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being part of the other. This occurs if z extends to overlap both y and x, for instance, when z covers the area where x and y meet.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. This occurs if z contains x entirely and overlaps part of y, but not all of it, and x touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is contained in z but does not touch z's boundary. This occurs if z contains x entirely and overlaps part of y, with x not touching z's boundary.

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible:
- **TPPi(x,z)** (equivalent to TPP(z,x)) and **NTPPi(x,z)** (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) would require z to be a proper part of x, but since z shares interior parts with y (due to PO(y,z)) and y has disjoint interior from x (due to EC(x,y)), z cannot be contained in x.
- **EQ(x,z)** would require x and z to be identical, but EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) imply that x, y, and z are distinct regions.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.
