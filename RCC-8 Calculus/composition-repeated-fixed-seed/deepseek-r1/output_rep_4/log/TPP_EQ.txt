PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be TPP(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions, so any relation that holds between x and y also holds between x and z. Specifically, TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC, EC, PO, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are excluded because x is a proper part of z and touches its boundary, satisfying only TPP.
