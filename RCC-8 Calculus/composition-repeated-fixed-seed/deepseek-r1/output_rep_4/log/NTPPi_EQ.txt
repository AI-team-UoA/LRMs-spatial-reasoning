PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and does not touch x's boundary).
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), substituting z for y in NTPP(y,x) gives NTPP(z,x).  
By definition, NTPP(z,x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).  
Thus, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).  

No other relations are possible because:
- If x and z were equal (EQ(x,z)), then y (which is identical to z) would equal x, contradicting NTPP(y,x) (a proper part cannot equal the whole).
- Other relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi) are inconsistent with NTPP(z,x).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
