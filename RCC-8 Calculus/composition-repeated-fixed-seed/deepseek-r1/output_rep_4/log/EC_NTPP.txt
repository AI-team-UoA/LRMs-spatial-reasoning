PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping, as x may overlap with z without being entirely contained within it or containing it. For example, x could extend partially inside z (where it touches y) and partially outside.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, where x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is adjacent to z's boundary while touching y inside z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part, where x is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary. This occurs if x is strictly contained in z's interior and touches y.

These relations are derived because:
- EC(x,y) implies x and y share a boundary point but no interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z) implies y is entirely inside z and does not touch z's boundary, so the shared boundary point between x and y lies in z's interior.
- Thus, x must share at least this point with z, ruling out DC (disconnected) and EQ (equal). EC(x,z) is impossible because the shared point is interior to z, not on its boundary. TPPi and NTPPi are excluded as they would require z to be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y) (since y inside z inside x implies x and y share interior, violating EC).
