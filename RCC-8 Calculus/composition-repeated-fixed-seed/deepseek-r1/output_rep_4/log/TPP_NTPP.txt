PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:  
- TPP(x,y) implies x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.  
- NTPP(y,z) implies y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.  
Since x is inside y and y is strictly inside z (without touching z's boundary), x must also be strictly inside z and cannot touch z's boundary. Thus, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.  
The only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
