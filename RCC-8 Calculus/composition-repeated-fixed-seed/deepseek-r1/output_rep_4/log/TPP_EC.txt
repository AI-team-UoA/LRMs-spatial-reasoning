PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is part of y and shares a boundary point with y.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, sharing a boundary point but no interior points.
- Since x is part of y and y is connected to z, x must be connected to z (C(x,z) holds).
- x and z cannot share interior points because x is entirely within y, and y and z share no interior points.
- Therefore, x and z share a boundary point but no interior points, resulting in EC(x,z).
- Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
  - DC(x,z) is impossible because C(x,z) holds.
  - PO(x,z) is impossible because no interior sharing.
  - EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) are impossible due to the part-whole constraints and lack of interior sharing between y and z.

Thus, EC(x,z) is the only possible relation.
