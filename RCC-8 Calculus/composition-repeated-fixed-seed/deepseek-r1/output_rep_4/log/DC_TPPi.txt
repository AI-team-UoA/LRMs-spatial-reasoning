PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary).

Since z is entirely contained within y (as a tangential proper part), and x shares no spatial parts with y (due to DC(x,y)), x cannot share any spatial parts with z. Specifically:
- x and z cannot be equal (EQ), partially overlapping (PO), or have any part-whole relationship (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi) because these require shared points.
- x and z cannot be externally connected (EC) because DC(x,y) implies no boundary contact between x and y, and z is contained within y.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is DC (disconnected). This is consistent with the RCC-8 composition table, where DC ; TPPi = DC.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
