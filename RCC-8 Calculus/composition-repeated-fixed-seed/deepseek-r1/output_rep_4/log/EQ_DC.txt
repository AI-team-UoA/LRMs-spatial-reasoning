PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident (the same region). Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. Since x is identical to y, the relationship between x and z must be the same as that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
