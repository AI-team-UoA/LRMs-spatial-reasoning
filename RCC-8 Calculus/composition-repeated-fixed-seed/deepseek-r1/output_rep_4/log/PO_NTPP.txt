PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of the RCC-8 relations.

- PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being a part of the other.
- NTPP(y,z) indicates that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely contained within z without touching its boundary.

Considering the spatial configuration:
- Since x overlaps y and y is strictly inside z, x must share some interior parts with z, ruling out disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC) relations.
- x cannot be equal to z (EQ) because y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps y, implying x is not coincident with z.
- z cannot be a part of x (e.g., TPPi or NTPPi) because PO(x,y) implies y is not part of x, and if z contained y, x containing z would imply x contains y, contradicting PO(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **PO(x,z)**: If x partially overlaps z but is not entirely contained within z or does not contain z. This occurs when x extends beyond z while still overlapping the region where y is located.
- **TPP(x,z)**: If x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. This can happen if x overlaps y and is positioned such that it contacts the boundary of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely contained within z without touching its boundary. This occurs if x overlaps y and is strictly inside the buffer zone around y within z.

These are the only possible relations, as confirmed by the RCC-8 composition table for PO â—¦ NTPP.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
