PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:

- EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected: they share a boundary point but have disjoint interiors.
- TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y: z is entirely within y, shares a boundary point with y, and is not equal to y.

Considering the relationship between x and z:
- The interiors of x and z are disjoint because:
  - The interior of z is contained within the interior of y (since z is a proper part of y).
  - The interior of x is disjoint from the interior of y (due to EC(x,y)).
- Thus, x and z cannot have overlapping interiors, ruling out PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.
- Possible relations are DC or EC:
  - **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This occurs if the boundary point shared by x and y is not part of z’s boundary. Since z is tangential to y’s boundary but may not cover the entire boundary, it is possible that x and z share no boundary points.
  - **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This occurs if the boundary point shared by x and y is also part of z’s boundary. Because z touches y’s boundary at some points, and if that includes the point where x meets y, then x and z share that boundary point.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are DC and EC.
