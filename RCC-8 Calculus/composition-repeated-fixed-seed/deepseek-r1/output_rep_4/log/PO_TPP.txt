PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, meaning x and z share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, meaning x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part, meaning x is a proper part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

These are the only possible relations because:
- x and z must share interior parts (since x overlaps y and y is inside z), ruling out DC and EC.
- x cannot be equal to z (EQ) because y is a proper part of z and x is not fully contained in y.
- z cannot be a part of x (TPPi or NTPPi) because that would imply y is part of x, contradicting PO(x,y).

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP
