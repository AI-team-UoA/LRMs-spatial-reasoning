PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.  
Given EC(y,z), which means that y and z are externally connected, sharing a boundary point but no interior parts.  

The possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:  
- Since y is inside x and not touching x's boundary, the point where y and z touch (due to EC(y,z)) is in the interior of x, not on its boundary.  
- This shared point implies that x and z cannot be disconnected (DC), as they share a common point.  
- They cannot be externally connected (EC) because the touch point is not on x's boundary, which is required for EC.  
- They cannot be equal (EQ) because y is a proper part of x, and z is connected to y externally, so x and z cannot coincide.  
- x cannot be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP) because that would imply y ⊆ x ⊆ z, so y ⊆ z, contradicting EC(y,z) which requires no interior sharing (y not subset of z).  
- z cannot be a proper part of y, as EC(y,z) requires no part-whole relationship between y and z.  

The possible relations are:  
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. This occurs if z overlaps with x but is not entirely contained within it. For example, z could extend from outside x to touch y inside.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. Here, z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Here, z is entirely within x and does not touch the boundary of x.  

These relations cover all cases consistent with the given constraints.
