PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations. NTPP(x,y) implies x is entirely within y without touching its boundary, and PO(y,z) indicates partial overlap between y and z without one being part of the other.

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the non-overlapping part of y (relative to z) and does not touch the overlapping region. Example: x inside y but completely separated from z.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x is in the non-overlapping part of y but touches the boundary of the overlapping region with z. Example: x adjacent to the shared area between y and z.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x is disconnected and spans both overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y with z. Example: one part of x in the overlap (so inside z) and another part outside z but within y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches the boundary of z. Example: x inside both y and z, but x contacts the edge of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region and does not touch the boundary of z. Example: x strictly inside both y and z, away from boundaries.

Relations like TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ are impossible because z cannot be part of x (since z extends beyond y, while x is confined within y), and x and z cannot be equal.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
