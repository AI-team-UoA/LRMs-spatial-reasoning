PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). This is because:
- x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and shares a boundary point with y.
- y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and shares a boundary point with z.
- Therefore, x must be a proper part of z, but it may or may not share a boundary point with z:
  - If x shares a boundary point with y that coincides with a boundary point of z (e.g., at the same tangent point), then TPP(x,z) holds.
  - If x shares a boundary point with y that does not coincide with a boundary point of z (e.g., at a different point), then NTPP(x,z) holds.

Other relations (DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are not possible because x is contained within z and cannot be disconnected, externally connected, partially overlapping, or equal to z, nor can z be part of x.

### Answer: TPP, NTPP
