PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x (so y is part of x and touches x's boundary).  
Given NTPPi(y,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (so z is part of y and does not touch y's boundary).  

Since z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary, and y is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary, z must be entirely contained within x. Because z does not touch y's boundary and is strictly interior to y, it cannot touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.  

This corresponds to the relation NTPPi(x,z), meaning z is NTPP of x.  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, NTPP, TPPi are all impossible due to the containment and boundary constraints.  

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).  

### Answer:  
NTPPi(x,z)
