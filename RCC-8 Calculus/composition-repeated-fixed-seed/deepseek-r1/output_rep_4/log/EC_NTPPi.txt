PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), we analyze the spatial relationships.  
- EC(x,y) implies that x and y share a boundary but no interior parts.  
- NTPP(z,y) implies that z is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.  

Since z is strictly inside y and not touching its boundary, and x only contacts y at the boundary without overlapping its interior, x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.  

The only possible relation is DC(x,z).  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
