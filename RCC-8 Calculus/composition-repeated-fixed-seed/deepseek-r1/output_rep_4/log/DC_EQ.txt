PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts, and EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (i.e., identical in spatial extent), the spatial relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Since y and z are equivalent, DC(x,y) directly implies DC(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EC(x,z) would require x and z to touch at a boundary, but DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) imply no contact.
- PO(x,z) would require partial overlap, contradicting no shared parts from DC(x,y).
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) would imply a part-whole relationship, which is inconsistent with disconnection.
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are coincident, but this contradicts DC(x,y) since y and z are equivalent.

Thus, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
