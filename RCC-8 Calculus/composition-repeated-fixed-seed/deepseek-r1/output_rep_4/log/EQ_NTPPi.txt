PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are identical spatial regions. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Since x and y are identical, z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z), which is defined as NTPP(z,x). This is the only possible relationship, as no other RCC-8 relation satisfies the conditions.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
