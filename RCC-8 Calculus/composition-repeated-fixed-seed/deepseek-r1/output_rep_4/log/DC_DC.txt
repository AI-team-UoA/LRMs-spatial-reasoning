PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are all eight RCC-8 relations. This is because the composition of DC with DC in the RCC-8 calculus allows for any relation between x and z, as there are no constraints forcing a specific connection or disconnection. The scenarios supporting each relation are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x, y, z are pairwise disjoint (e.g., three separate circles).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally, while y is separate from both (e.g., x and z adjacent, y elsewhere).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, while y is separate (e.g., x and z overlapping regions, y disjoint).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, and y is outside both (e.g., x inside z touching boundary, y outside).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x)), and y is outside both (e.g., z inside x touching boundary, y outside).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and y is outside both (e.g., x entirely inside z, y outside).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(z,x)), and y is outside both (e.g., z entirely inside x, y outside).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are identical, and y is separate (e.g., x = z, y disjoint).

Thus, no relation is excluded.
