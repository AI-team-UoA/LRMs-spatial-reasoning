PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. Given EC(y,z), meaning y and z are externally connected, sharing a boundary point but no interior points.

The possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and spatial reasoning:

- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This occurs if z is outside x but touches x at the boundary point where y is located.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping. This occurs if z overlaps x in some areas but does not share interior points with y, and the touch point between y and z may be interior or on the boundary of x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of tangential proper part, meaning TPP(z,x). This occurs if z is a tangential proper part of x and touches y at a boundary point.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of non-tangential proper part, meaning NTPP(z,x). This occurs if z is a non-tangential proper part of x and touches y at a point interior to x.

Relations such as DC(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,y) (for z), NTPPi(x,y) (for z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible due to contradictions with the given relations (e.g., x cannot be part of z or disjoint from z while satisfying the connections).

Thus, the possible relations are EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi for (x,z).

### Answer:
EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
