PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the constraints:

- TPP(x,y) implies x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(z,y) implies z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Considering the spatial relationships between x and z:

1. **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected - Possible if x and z share no common points (e.g., x and z are disjoint regions inside y).
2. **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected - Possible if x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts (e.g., x and z are adjacent but non-overlapping).
3. **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping - Possible if x and z share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other.
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Tangential proper part inverse - Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (e.g., z is inside x and touches x's boundary, without violating the non-tangential constraint of z relative to y).
5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part inverse - Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (e.g., z is inside x and does not touch x's boundary).

The relations TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because they would imply x is a proper part of z, but z is entirely interior to y (non-tangential), which would require x to also be non-tangential relative to y, contradicting TPP(x,y). EQ(x,z) is impossible because x touches y's boundary while z does not.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
