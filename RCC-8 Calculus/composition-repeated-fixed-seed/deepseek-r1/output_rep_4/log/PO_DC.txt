PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are PO(x,y) and DC(y,z). PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a part of the other. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no parts.  

To determine the possible relations between x and z:  
- Since y and z share no parts (DC(y,z)), the part of x that overlaps with y cannot intersect with z.  
- However, x may have regions outside the overlap with y that could relate to z in various ways.  

Possible relations for x and z:  
1. **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. Possible if x and z have no common parts.  
2. **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. Possible if they touch only at boundaries without sharing interiors.  
3. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. Possible if x and z share some interior parts not overlapping with y.  
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Tangential proper part inverse (i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x). Possible if z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary.  
5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part inverse (i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of x). Possible if z is entirely within x without touching its boundary.  

Excluded relations:  
- **TPP(x,z)** or **NTPP(x,z)**: x cannot be a proper part of z, as the overlap between x and y would then force y and z to share parts, violating DC(y,z).  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equality is impossible, as it would imply PO(x,y) and DC(y,x) (since z â‰¡ x), which is contradictory (PO requires shared parts, DC requires none).  

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.  

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
