PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (identical regions), and TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches zâ€™s boundary), we can substitute x for y due to their identity. Thus, TPP(y,z) directly implies TPP(x,z). There are no other possible relations, as the identity between x and y ensures that the relationship between x and z is identical to that between y and z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
