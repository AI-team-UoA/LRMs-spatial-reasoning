PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP. This is determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations, where EC composed with NTPP results in partial overlap (PO), tangential proper part (TPP), or non-tangential proper part (NTPP). 

- PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap, sharing some but not all parts.
- TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).
- NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary).

Other relations (DC, EC, EQ, TPPi, NTPPi) are impossible because:
- DC and EC are excluded since x and z must share at least one point (the point where x and y touch, which is inside z).
- EQ is excluded as x and z are not coincident.
- TPPi and NTPPi are excluded because they imply z is part of x, but with y inside z and x touching y, this would contradict EC(x,y) (no interior overlap).

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP
