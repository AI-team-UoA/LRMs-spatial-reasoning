PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z must be determined.

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Since x is entirely within y and y shares no parts with z, x must also share no parts with z. Therefore, x and z must be disconnected, meaning DC(x,z) is the only possible relation.

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- EC(x,z) is impossible because x does not touch y's boundary, and y and z have no boundary contact.
- PO(x,z) is impossible because any overlap between x and z would imply y and z share parts, contradicting DC(y,z).
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are all impossible because they imply some form of parthood or equality that would conflict with DC(y,z) (e.g., if x were part of z or z part of x, it would connect y and z).

Thus, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).
