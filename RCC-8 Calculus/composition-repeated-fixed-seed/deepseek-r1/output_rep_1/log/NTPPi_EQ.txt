PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x) (y is a non-tangential proper part of x), and EQ(y,z) (y and z are equal), then z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z). This is the only possible relationship, as the equality EQ(y,z) implies that z inherits all spatial relations of y with respect to x.

### Answer:  
NTPPi(x,z)
