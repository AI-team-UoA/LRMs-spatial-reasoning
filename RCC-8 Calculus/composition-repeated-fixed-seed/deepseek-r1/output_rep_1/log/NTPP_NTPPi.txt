PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which implies NTPP(z,y), both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. This means that x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary, and similarly for z.

The possible spatial relations between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations, as there are no restrictions based on the given information. Specifically:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no parts.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected, touching at a boundary but with no shared interior.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of TPP, equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident and equal.

All eight relations are possible because both x and z are contained within y without touching its boundary, and their relative positioning can vary independently (e.g., they can be disjoint, overlapping, or one can contain the other).
