PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are identical. Since DC(y,z) indicates that y and z are disconnected and share no parts, x must also be disconnected from z, as x and y are the same entity. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
