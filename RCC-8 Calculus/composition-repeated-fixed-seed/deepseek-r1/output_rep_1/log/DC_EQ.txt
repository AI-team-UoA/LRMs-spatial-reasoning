PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be DC(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical spatial regions. Therefore, the disconnectedness between x and y directly applies to x and z, meaning they share no spatial parts and are disconnected. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as any other relation (such as EC, PO, TPP, etc.) would imply some form of connection or part-sharing, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
