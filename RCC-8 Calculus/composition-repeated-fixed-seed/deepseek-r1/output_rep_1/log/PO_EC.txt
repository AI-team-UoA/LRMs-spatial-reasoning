PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The possible relations are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, with no shared parts. This occurs if the part of x overlapping y is away from the boundary where y and z touch.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs if x overlaps y near the boundary where y and z touch, and x touches z at that boundary without overlapping.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither is part of the other. This occurs if x extends over the boundary where y and z touch, covering part of z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)). This occurs if z is a subregion of x on the boundary of x, and y touches z externally while overlapping x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)). This occurs if z is entirely within the interior of x (not touching the boundary), and y touches z externally while overlapping x.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- If x were a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP), then PO(x,y) would imply that y shares interior with z, contradicting EC(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) is impossible since x and y are not coincident (PO(x,y)), and z is distinct from y (EC(y,z)).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
