PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), which means x and y are coincident (identical regions). Given TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y) (z is a tangential proper part of y). Since x and y are identical, substituting y with x in TPP(z,y) yields TPP(z,x). This is equivalent to TPPi(x,z) by definition. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).
