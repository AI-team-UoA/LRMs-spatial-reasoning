PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z), meaning they are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

- EC(x,y) indicates that x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y, so z is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch its boundary.
- Since z is strictly interior to y and not on the boundary, and x only contacts y at the boundary (without sharing interior), x and z cannot share any points or be connected. Therefore, they must be disconnected (DC).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- EC(x,z) is impossible because z is not on the boundary of y, so x and z cannot touch.
- PO(x,z) is impossible because x and y share no interior, and z is inside y, so x and z cannot overlap.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ are impossible due to the spatial separation and lack of part-whole relationships between x and z.

Thus, DC is the only possible relation.
