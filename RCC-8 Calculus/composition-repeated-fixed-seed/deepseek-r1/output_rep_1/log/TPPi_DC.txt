PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary). Also given DC(y,z), meaning y and z are disconnected and share no parts. The possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. Since y is inside x and disconnected from z, z could be entirely outside x.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally. z could touch x's boundary at a point not shared with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. z could share some interior with x without overlapping y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x. z could be inside x, touching its boundary, and disconnected from y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z could be inside x, not touching the boundary, and disconnected from y.

Relations like TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or EQ(x,z) are impossible because they would imply x is part of z or equal to z, leading to y being part of z (via TPP(y,x)), contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
