PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial constraints of the RCC-8 calculus. PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is a proper part of the other. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no points.

- x and z can be disconnected (DC(x,z)) if z is completely separate from x, including the parts of x not overlapping with y.
- x and z can be externally connected (EC(x,z)) if they touch at a boundary but share no interior points, which is possible if z is adjacent to the exclusive part of x (not overlapping y).
- x and z can partially overlap (PO(x,z)) if z overlaps with the part of x that does not overlap with y.
- z can be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z), equivalent to TPP(z,x)) if z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, but only in the region where x does not overlap y.
- z can be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z), equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) if z is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary, again only in the region where x does not overlap y.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are the same, but PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) would conflict (since DC(y,x) would hold but PO(x,y) requires connection).
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, but this would mean that the points shared by x and y are also in z, violating DC(y,z).

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
