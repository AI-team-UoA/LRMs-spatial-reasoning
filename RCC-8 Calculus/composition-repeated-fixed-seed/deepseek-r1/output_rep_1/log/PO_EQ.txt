PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be the same as between x and y because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions. Therefore, PO(x,z) holds, as partial overlap is symmetric and no other RCC-8 relation is consistent with the given conditions.

- PO(x,y) means x and y share spatial parts but neither is part of the other.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident, so z can be substituted for y in any relation.
- Thus, PO(x,z) is the only possible relation.

Other RCC-8 relations are not possible:
- DC, EC: Require no overlap or only boundary contact, but PO implies overlap.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi: Imply one is a proper part, but PO requires neither is part of the other.
- EQ: Would imply x and z are equal, but PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) would then imply EQ(x,y), contradicting PO.

Hence, the only possible relationship is PO.
