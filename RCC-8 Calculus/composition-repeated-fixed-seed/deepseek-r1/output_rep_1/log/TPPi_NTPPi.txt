PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary).  
Given NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and does not touch y's boundary).  

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y and y is a tangential proper part of x, z must be a proper part of x. Because z does not touch y's boundary and y touches x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning NTPP(z,x).  

The relation from x to z is thus NTPPi(x,z), as NTPPi(x,z) â‰¡ NTPP(z,x).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:  
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because z is a proper part of x.  
- TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z) is impossible because z does not touch x's boundary.  
- PO(x,z) is impossible because z is a proper part of x, not partially overlapping.  
- EC(x,z) or DC(x,z) is impossible because x and z share spatial parts.  

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).
