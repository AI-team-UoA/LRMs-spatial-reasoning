PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z):
- TPP(x,y) implies that x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary).
- DC(y,z) implies that y and z are disconnected (no shared parts).

Since x is entirely contained within y (as a part of y), and y has no spatial overlap with z, x cannot share any part with z. If x and z shared any part, that part would also belong to y (since x is part of y), contradicting DC(y,z). Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.

The only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
