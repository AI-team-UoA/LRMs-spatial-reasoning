PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).  
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected (no shared parts).  
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z, not touching its boundary).  

To determine possible relations between x and z:  
1. **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely outside z.  
2. **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x touches z's boundary externally but does not overlap (since y is inside z and disconnected from x, this is allowed).  
3. **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x partially overlaps z (some part of x is inside z, but not all, and x is not a proper part of z; y being inside z but disconnected from x does not prevent partial overlap).  
4. **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary; y is also inside z but disconnected from x, which is consistent).  
5. **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is entirely inside z without touching the boundary; y is inside z but disconnected, which is consistent).  

Impossible relations:  
- **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**, or **EQ(x,z)**: Would require z to be part of x or equal to x, but this contradicts DC(x,y) since y (which is inside z) would then share parts with x.  

Thus, the possible relations are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
