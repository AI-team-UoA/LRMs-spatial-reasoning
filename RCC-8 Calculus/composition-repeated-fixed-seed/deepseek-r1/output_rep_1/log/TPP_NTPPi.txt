PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is entirely contained within y's interior without touching its boundary.

We need to find the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

### Analysis:
- Both x and z are inside y, but their positions differ:
  - x touches y's boundary.
  - z is entirely in y's interior (not touching y's boundary).
- Therefore, x and z can be arranged in various ways within y, leading to multiple possible relations.

### Possible relations between x and z:
1. **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected.  
   - Possible if x and z are disjoint regions within y (e.g., x is at one part of y's boundary, z is deep inside another part without overlap).

2. **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected.  
   - Possible if x and z touch only at a boundary point (e.g., x touches z at a point in y's interior, not y's boundary).

3. **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping.  
   - Possible if x and z share some interior points but neither is a proper part of the other (e.g., z overlaps with a portion of x inside y).

4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x).  
   - Possible if z is a tangential proper part of x (e.g., z is inside x and touches x's boundary, which is within y's interior).

5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(z,x).  
   - Possible if z is a non-tangential proper part of x (e.g., z is entirely contained in x's interior without touching x's boundary).

### Excluded relations:
- **TPP(x,z)**: x cannot be a tangential proper part of z because x touches y's boundary, but z is entirely in y's interior; if x were inside z, it would force z to include y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(z,y).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z for similar reasons; x touching y's boundary would imply z touches y's boundary, violating NTPP(z,y).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z cannot be equal because x touches y's boundary, while z does not.

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
