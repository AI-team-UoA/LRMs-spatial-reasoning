PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the spatial relation between x and z must be EC(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are coincident, meaning they represent the same spatial region. Therefore, the relation between x and y directly applies to x and z. Since EC(x,y) indicates that x and y are externally connected (touching at a boundary with no shared interior parts), and z is identical to y, it follows that x and z are externally connected, resulting in EC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) would imply disconnection, contradicting the connection from EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).
- PO(x,z) would imply partial overlap, but EC specifies no shared interior parts.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi would imply part-hood, which EC denies as x is not part of y (and thus not part of z).
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are coincident, but EC(x,y) requires x and y to be distinct regions, and since y and z are coincident, x and z must also be distinct.

Thus, the only possible relation is EC(x,z).
