PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z). TPP(x,y) indicates that x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary. PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but each having parts not shared with the other.

The possible relations between x and z are determined by the relative positions of x, y, and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the non-overlapping part of y (y minus z), making x and z disjoint.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x lies in the non-overlapping part of y but touches the boundary of the overlapping region with z, causing x and z to touch externally without sharing interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x spans both the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y, leading to partial overlap with z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and does not touch z's boundary.

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible because:
- TPPi or NTPPi would require z to be a proper part of x, which contradicts x being a proper part of y and y only partially overlapping with z.
- EQ would require x and z to be identical, but x is strictly inside y while z only partially overlaps y.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
