PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relationships between x and z.

- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x, does not touch the boundary of x, and is not equal to x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. Thus, y is entirely contained within z, touches the boundary of z, and is not equal to z.

The goal is to determine the relation between x and z. Considering the constraints:
- y is inside both x and z, so x and z must share at least the region of y, ruling out DC and EC.
- EQ is impossible because y does not touch the boundary of x but touches the boundary of z, implying x and z are not coincident.
- PO is impossible because if x and z partially overlap, y touching the boundary of z could imply y touching the boundary of x (violating NTPPi(x,y)), or lead to inconsistencies in boundary contact.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) (x inside z) is impossible because y inside x would require x to extend to the boundary of z for y to touch it, but then y would touch the boundary of x (violating NTPPi(x,y)).
- TPPi(x,z) (equivalent to TPP(z,x)) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible: z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, but y touches a boundary of z that is not shared with x, so y does not touch the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x,z) (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible: z is inside x without touching the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of z within the interior of x, so y does not touch the boundary of x.

Thus, the possible relations are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
