PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region, with y as a tangential proper part of both.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being part of the other. This can occur if x and z both contain y but extend beyond each other, with y touching the boundaries of both x and z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z contains x, with x touching z's boundary, and y positioned such that it touches both boundaries consistently.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x contains z, with z touching x's boundary, and y positioned such that it touches both boundaries consistently.

The relations NTPP, NTPPi, DC, and EC are not possible:
- NTPP(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) (via NTPPi) would imply no boundary touching, contradicting the requirement from TPP(y,z) that y touches z's boundary or from TPPi(x,y) that y touches x's boundary.
- DC or EC would imply no shared parts or no shared interior, but y is a shared part with interior, contradicting these relations.

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are EQ, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

### Answer: EQ, PO, TPP, TPPi
