PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. Also given PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap: they share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other.

To determine possible relations between x and z:

- **PO(x,z)**: Possible. z may overlap with x in the region where y is located, but extend outside x. For example, y is a disk inside x touching x's boundary, and z overlaps y but extends beyond x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Possible. z is entirely within x, touches x's boundary, and overlaps with y (which is also inside x). Neither z nor y is part of the other, satisfying PO(y,z).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Possible. z is entirely within x without touching the boundary, and overlaps with y. Again, PO(y,z) holds as y and z share parts but neither contains the other.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: z must share parts with x via y, so they are not disconnected.
- **EC(x,z)**: They share interior parts (via y), so cannot be externally connected.
- **TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)**: Would imply x is part of z, but y is part of x and overlaps z, leading to y being part of z, contradicting PO(y,z).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Would imply y is part of x and overlaps x, but PO(y,z) requires y not part of z, a contradiction.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
