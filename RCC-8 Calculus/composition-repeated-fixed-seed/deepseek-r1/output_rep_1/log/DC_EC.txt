PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the composition of these spatial relations according to the RCC-8 calculus. The analysis yields the following possibilities:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This occurs when x and z are separated by y or otherwise do not interact spatially.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This can happen if x and z are adjacent, even though both are related to y without overlapping it.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being a part of the other. This is possible if x and z overlap in a region disjoint from y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This can occur if z contains x and both are spatially arranged such that x is near z's edge.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z but not touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z's interior.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., x contains z and they touch at z's boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., x contains z without touching its boundary).

The relation EQ(x,z) (x and z being coincident) is impossible because DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) imply that x and z cannot be the same region (as EQ would conflict with the given relations). Thus, the complete set of possible relations is DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi
