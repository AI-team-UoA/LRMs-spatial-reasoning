PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary).  
Given NTPP(y,z), so y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary).  

The possible relations between x and z are:  
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither is part of the other.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary).  

These relations are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and spatial reasoning:  
- Since y is on the boundary of x and strictly inside z, x cannot be disconnected or externally connected to z (DC and EC are impossible).  
- x and z cannot be equal (EQ is impossible) because y cannot be both tangential to x and non-tangential to z if x and z are the same region.  
- z cannot be a proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi are impossible) due to the conflict with y's position on x's boundary and strictly inside z.  

Thus, the only possible relations are PO, TPP, and NTPP for x and z.  

### Answer:  
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
