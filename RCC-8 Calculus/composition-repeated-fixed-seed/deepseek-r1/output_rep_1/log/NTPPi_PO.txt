PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z):

- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within x without touching its boundary.
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap; they share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other.

Considering possible relations between x and z:

1. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is possible. For example, z may overlap with y (which is inside x) but extend outside x, leading to shared parts without containment.
2. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, while still partially overlapping y.
3. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely within x without touching its boundary, while partially overlapping y.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because y is inside x and overlaps z, so x and z share parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected is impossible because they share interior parts (via y and z overlap).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equality is impossible because y is a proper part of x but not of z (since PO(y,z) implies y is not contained in z).
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**: x being a proper part of z is impossible because y is inside x and PO(y,z) requires y not to be contained in z, but if x were a proper part of z, y would be contained in z.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
