PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected).

- **DC(x,z)**: This occurs when x is not located at the boundary point where y and z touch. Since x is a tangential proper part of y but not at the connection point with z, x and z share no points and are disconnected.
- **EC(x,z)**: This occurs when x is located at the boundary point where y and z touch. Since x shares a boundary point with y and y shares that point with z, x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- PO (partial overlap) is impossible because y and z share no interior points, and x is part of y, so x cannot overlap with z interiorly.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ are impossible because x is entirely within y, and z is separate from y except at the boundary, so x cannot be part of z, z cannot be part of x, and they cannot be equal.

### Answer:
DC, EC
