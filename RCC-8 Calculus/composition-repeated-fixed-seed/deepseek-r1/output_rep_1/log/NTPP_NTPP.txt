PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The relations are given as NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).  
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.  
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.  

Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x must be inside z. The non-tangential condition ensures that x is separated from the boundary of y, and y is separated from the boundary of z. Consequently, x cannot touch the boundary of z. Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.  

This rules out all other RCC-8 relations:  
- **DC(x,z)**: Impossible, as x and z share spatial points.  
- **EC(x,z)**: Impossible, as they share interior points (x is inside z).  
- **PO(x,z)**: Impossible, as x is entirely within z (not partial overlap).  
- **TPP(x,z)**: Impossible, as x does not touch z's boundary.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Impossible, as z cannot be a tangential proper part of x (z contains x).  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Impossible, as z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x (z contains x).  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible, as x is a proper part of z (since y is a proper part of z and x is a proper part of y).  

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).
