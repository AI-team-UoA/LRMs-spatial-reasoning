PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary).
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary).

Therefore:
- z is contained within y, and y is contained within x.
- Since both are non-tangential, z must be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.
- This implies that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, expressed as NTPP(z,x).
- The relation between x and z is the inverse of NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).

By the RCC-8 composition rules, the composition of NTPP (from z to y) and NTPP (from y to x) results exclusively in NTPP (from z to x). Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
