PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x, y) holds, x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely within y and does not touch its boundary). Additionally, EQ(y, z) indicates that y and z are coincident (identical spatial regions). Therefore, x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z, as z is the same region as y. The relation NTPP(x, z) is the only possible relationship, as no other RCC-8 relation is consistent with these conditions.

### Answer: NTPP(x, z)
