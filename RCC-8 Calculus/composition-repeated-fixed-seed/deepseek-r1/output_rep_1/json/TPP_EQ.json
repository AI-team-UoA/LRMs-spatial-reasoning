{"prompt": "If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical spatial regions. Therefore, the relation between x and y directly applies to x and z. TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x must also be a tangential proper part of z. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as the equality constrains the relationship uniquely.\n\n### Answer: TPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 23.021079778671265, "reasoning-tokens": 373, "completion-tokens": 471}
