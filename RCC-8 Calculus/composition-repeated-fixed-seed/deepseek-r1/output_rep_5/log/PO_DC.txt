PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the RCC-8 composition rules. Since PO(x,y) indicates that x and y share some spatial parts but neither is a part of the other, and DC(y,z) indicates that y and z have no common spatial parts, the relations between x and z must avoid any indirect sharing of parts that would violate DC(y,z).

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This occurs if x does not interact with z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs if x extends from y to touch z without overlapping.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither being part of the other. This occurs if x overlaps both y and z, but y and z remain disconnected.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)). This occurs if z is part of x and touches x's boundary, with y disconnected from z.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)). This occurs if z is entirely contained within x without touching the boundary, with y disconnected from z.

Other relations are impossible:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because it would imply x and z are the same, contradicting PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).
- PO(x,z) is possible, as explained above.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) are impossible because if x were a proper part of z, then the overlap between x and y would imply that y and z share parts, violating DC(y,z).
- Similarly, TPPi or NTPPi for z being part of x are possible, as listed.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
