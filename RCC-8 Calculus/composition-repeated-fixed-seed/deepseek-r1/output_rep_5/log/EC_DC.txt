PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The constraints are:

- EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected (they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts).
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (they share no spatial parts and do not touch).

The possible relations for (x,z) are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if z is spatially distant from both x and y, or if z is near x but not touching it.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches x at a boundary but does not touch y, and y is disconnected from z.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This can happen if x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other, and y is externally connected to x but disconnected from z.

Other RCC-8 relations are not possible:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because if x and z were equal, EC(x,y) would imply EC(z,y), contradicting DC(y,z).
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because if x is a part of z or vice versa, then EC(x,y) would imply a connection between y and z (contradicting DC(y,z)).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, and PO.
