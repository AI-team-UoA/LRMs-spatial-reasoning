PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus.  

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely outside z. Since y is inside z and x is disconnected from y, x may not intersect z at all.  
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x touches the boundary of z externally but does not overlap its interior. This is consistent with x being disconnected from y (inside z).  
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x partially overlaps z but shares no part with y. Since y is strictly inside z, x can overlap z in regions away from y.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z (inside and touching the boundary). x can be disconnected from y if they are separated within z.  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z (inside without touching the boundary). x and y can both be inside z but disconnected.  

The relations **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**, and **EQ(x,z)** are impossible:  
- TPPi(x,z) (i.e., TPP(z,x)) or NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x)) would imply z is inside x, but y is inside z, so y would be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).  
- EQ(x,z) would make x and z the same, but y is inside z (hence inside x), contradicting DC(x,y).  

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.  

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
