PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is EC(x,z).

- EC(x,y) indicates that x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region, so z inherits all properties of y with respect to x.
- Thus, x and z must also touch at the boundary with no interior sharing, resulting in EC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as the equality EQ(y,z) preserves the relation from x to y directly to x to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
