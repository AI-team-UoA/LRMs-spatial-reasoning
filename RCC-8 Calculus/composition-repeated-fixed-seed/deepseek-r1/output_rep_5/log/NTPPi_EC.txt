PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x. Additionally, EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, sharing a boundary but no interior parts.

Considering the spatial relationships:
- Since y is entirely within the interior of x, the boundary shared between y and z must also lie within the interior of x.
- This implies that z must have some part inside x (as the shared boundary is inside x), ruling out DC(x,z) (disconnected).
- EC(x,z) is impossible because if z were externally connected to x, it would not share interior points, but the shared boundary with y (inside x) forces z to overlap with x's interior in some way.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because y is a proper part of x and externally connected to z, so x and z cannot be equal.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, but then y (inside x) would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z) (which requires disjoint interiors).

Possible relations:
1. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap occurs if z extends both inside and outside x. The part of z inside x shares interior points with x, but neither is part of the other.
2. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This happens if z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary.
3. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
