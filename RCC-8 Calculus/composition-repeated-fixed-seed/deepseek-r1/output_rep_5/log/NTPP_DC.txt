PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y), x is entirely contained within y without touching its boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected and share no parts. Since x is a part of y and y shares no parts with z, x must also share no parts with z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
