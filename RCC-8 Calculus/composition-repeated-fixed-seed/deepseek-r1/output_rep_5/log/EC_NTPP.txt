PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

- **EC(x,y)**: x and y are externally connected (share a boundary but no interior).
- **NTPP(y,z)**: y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary).

### Reasoning:
1. **y is entirely inside z** (NTPP(y,z)), so any connection to y involves z.
2. **x touches y's boundary** (EC(x,y)), which occurs inside z (since y is away from z's boundary).
3. Thus, x must interact with z:
   - **DC(x,z) is impossible**: x is connected to y (inside z), so x cannot be disconnected from z.
   - **EC(x,z) is impossible**: x touches y inside z (not on z's boundary), so x must share interior with z (violating EC's no-interior-sharing).
   - **EQ(x,z) is impossible**: would imply y is inside x, contradicting EC(x,y) (no interior sharing).
   - **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) is impossible**: would imply z is part of x, forcing y to be part of x, contradicting EC(x,y).
4. **Possible relations**:
   - **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. Example: x overlaps z partially (some interior shared) and touches y inside z.
   - **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. Example: x is inside z (touching z's boundary) and touches y inside z.
   - **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Example: x is entirely inside z (away from boundary) and touches y inside z.

### Final Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
