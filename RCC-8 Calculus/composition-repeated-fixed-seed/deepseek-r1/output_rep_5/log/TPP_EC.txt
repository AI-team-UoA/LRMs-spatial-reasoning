PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- TPP(x,y) indicates that x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) indicates that y and z are externally connected, meaning they share a boundary but no interior parts.

Consider the spatial arrangement:
- x is entirely within y (due to TPP(x,y)).
- y and z touch at a boundary but have no overlapping interiors (due to EC(y,z)).

Thus, the relation between x and z depends on whether x is located at the boundary of y adjacent to z:
1. If x is at the boundary of y that touches z, then x and z will touch at that boundary without overlapping interiors, resulting in EC(x,z).
2. If x is not at the boundary of y that touches z, then x and z will not touch and have no overlapping parts, resulting in DC(x,z).

Other relations are impossible:
- PO(x,z): Requires partial overlap of interiors, but x is entirely within y and z has no interior overlap with y.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z): Require x to be inside z, but z is outside y (except at the boundary) and x is inside y.
- TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z): Require z to be inside x, but x is a proper part of y and cannot contain z.
- EQ(x,z): Requires x and z to be coincident, but x is inside y and z is partially outside y.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are DC and EC.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
