PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

To determine the possible relationships between x and z:
- Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, every point of z is also a point of y.
- DC(x,y) means x shares no points with y.
- Therefore, x cannot share any points with z, as that would imply x shares points with y, contradicting DC(x,y).
- Consequently, x and z must be disconnected, meaning the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- EQ(x,z): Cannot hold because z is part of y and x is disconnected from y, so x and z cannot be coincident.
- PO(x,z): Partial overlap would imply x and z share a spatial part, but since z is part of y, this would mean x shares a part with y, contradicting DC(x,y).
- EC(x,z): External connection would imply x and z touch at a boundary, but since z is internal to y and not on its boundary, this would require x to be connected to y, contradicting DC(x,y).
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z): Any part relation would imply a connection or shared parts, which contradicts DC(x,y) and the containment of z in y.

Thus, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
