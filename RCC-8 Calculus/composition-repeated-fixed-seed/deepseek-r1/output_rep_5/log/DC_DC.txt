PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given conditions are DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), meaning x is disconnected from y and y is disconnected from z. In the RCC-8 calculus, the composition of DC with DC allows for any possible relation between x and z. This is because the disconnection between x and y, and y and z, imposes no constraints on the direct spatial relationship between x and z. Therefore, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (equal).

Thus, every RCC-8 relation is a possible answer.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
