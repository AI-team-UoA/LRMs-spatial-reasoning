PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs if x is entirely outside z but touches it at the point where y is located.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other. This occurs if x straddles the boundary of z, overlapping partially with it.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This occurs if x is also inside z and tangential, adjacent to y.

These are the only possible relations, as other RCC-8 relations are excluded:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and z share a boundary point via y.
- NTPP(x,z) is impossible because x touches y, which is on the boundary of z, preventing x from being non-tangential.
- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because they imply z is part of x, contradicting EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) is impossible as x and z cannot be coincident given the relations.

### Answer:  
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z)
