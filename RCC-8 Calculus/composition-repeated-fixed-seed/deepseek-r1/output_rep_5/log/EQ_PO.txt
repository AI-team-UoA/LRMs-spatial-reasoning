PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical, and PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (sharing some spatial parts but neither being part of the other), the relationship between x and z must be the same as that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and z share spatial parts (since y and z do, and x = y).
- EC(x,z) is impossible because PO involves interior overlap, not just boundary contact.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because PO implies neither region is part of the other.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because PO(y,z) implies y and z are not identical, and since x = y, x and z cannot be identical.

Thus, PO(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
