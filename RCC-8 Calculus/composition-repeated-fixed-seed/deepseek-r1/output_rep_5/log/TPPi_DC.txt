PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x and touches x's boundary. Also, DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no parts. The possible relations between x and z are determined by considering the spatial constraints:

- **DC(x,z)**: z is entirely outside x and not touching x. Since y is inside x and disconnected from z, z can be completely separate from x.
- **EC(x,z)**: z is outside x but touches x's boundary at a point not shared with y. This is possible because y only touches part of x's boundary, leaving other boundary points available for contact with z.
- **PO(x,z)**: z partially overlaps x but shares no parts with y. The overlap occurs in regions of x not occupied by y, and the non-overlapping part of z is outside x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary (tangential proper part), but at a boundary point distinct from where y touches, ensuring no overlap with y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is entirely inside x and does not touch x's boundary (non-tangential proper part), remaining disconnected from y.

Other relations are impossible:
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are identical, but then DC(y,z) contradicts TPPi(x,y) as y is part of x and thus cannot be disconnected from x (which equals z).
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is part of z, but then y (part of x) would be part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- PO, TPPi, and NTPPi cover the cases of partial or complete containment without conflict.

Thus, the possible relations are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
