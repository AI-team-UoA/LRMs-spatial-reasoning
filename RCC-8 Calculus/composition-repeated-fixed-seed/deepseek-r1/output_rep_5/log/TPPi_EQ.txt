PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we analyze the relations:  
- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x, they share a boundary, and x â‰  y.  
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical (coincident regions).  

Since z is identical to y, the relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) holds:  
- TPPi(x,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x.  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible because z is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z)).  
- **DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, NTPPi**: Ruled out because the only consistent relation is TPPi(x,z), given the constraints.  

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is TPPi.
