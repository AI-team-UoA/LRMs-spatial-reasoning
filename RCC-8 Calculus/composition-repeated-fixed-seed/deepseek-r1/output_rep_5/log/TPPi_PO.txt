PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary). Also given PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap (they share interior parts but neither is part of the other).

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if z overlaps with x but extends outside x. Since y is inside x and overlaps z, z must share interior with x. If z extends beyond x, PO holds.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary, while still overlapping y (which is inside x).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within x without touching its boundary, while overlapping y.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Cannot hold because z overlaps y, which is inside x, so x and z share interior parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: Cannot hold because the overlap between y and z is interior, so x and z must share interior parts (not just boundaries).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Cannot hold because y is a proper part of x (TPP(y,x)), but PO(y,z) implies y is not part of z and z is not part of y. If x and z were equal, y would be part of both, contradicting PO(y,z).
- **TPP(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPPi(z,x). If x were a tangential proper part of z, then y (inside x) would be part of z. But PO(y,z) requires y is not part of z, a contradiction.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPPi(z,x). Similarly, if x were a non-tangential proper part of z, y would be part of z, contradicting PO(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
