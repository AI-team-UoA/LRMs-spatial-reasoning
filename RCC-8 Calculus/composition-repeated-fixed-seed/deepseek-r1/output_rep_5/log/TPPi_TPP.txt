PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z):  
- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x.  
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.  

The possible relations between x and z are:  
1. **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region.  
2. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This occurs if x is contained in z and shares a boundary point with z.  
3. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is contained in x and shares a boundary point with x.  
4. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing interior parts but neither is a part of the other.  

These relations are consistent with the constraints:  
- y is a common part of both x and z, ruling out DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected).  
- The tangential contact of y with both x and z prevents NTPP or NTPPi (non-tangential proper parts), as y's boundary contact implies x and z must also have boundary contact if one is part of the other.
