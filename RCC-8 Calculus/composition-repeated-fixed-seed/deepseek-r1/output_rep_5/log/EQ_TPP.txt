PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z):  
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region.  
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary).  

Since x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), substituting x for y in TPP(y,z) directly yields TPP(x,z). Thus, x is a tangential proper part of z.  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because the equality forces x to inherit y's relationship with z exactly.  

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
