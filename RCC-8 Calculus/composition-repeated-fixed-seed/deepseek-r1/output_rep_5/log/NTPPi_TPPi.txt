PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the relation between x and z must be determined.

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary).
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is part of y and touches y's boundary).

Since y is strictly inside x without touching its boundary, and z is part of y and touches y's boundary (which is inside x), z must be entirely within x and cannot touch x's boundary. This is because y's boundary is separated from x's boundary due to the non-tangential relation. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, leading to the relation NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC, EC, PO: Not possible because z is contained within y and thus within x.
- TPP, NTPP: These would imply z is part of x but from x's perspective; NTPP(x,z) would mean z contains x as a non-tangential part, which is not the case.
- TPPi: Would require z to touch x's boundary, but z is separated from x's boundary by the interior of x around y.
- EQ: Not possible as z is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of x.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
