PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely contained within the interior of x, and x is not equal to y.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).

Since y and z are identical, the relationship between x and z is the same as between x and y. Therefore, NTPP(y,x) directly implies NTPP(z,x). By definition, NTPP(z,x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, and EQ are excluded:
  - DC, EC, PO: Require no part-of relationship, but z is part of x.
  - TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z): Require touching the boundary, but NTPP implies no boundary contact.
  - NTPP(x,z): Would mean x is part of z, but z is part of x and not equal, leading to contradiction.
  - EQ(x,z): Would require x and z to be equal, but z is a proper part of x.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
