PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

### Reasoning:
- Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), x is inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- Since y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), y is inside z and touches z's boundary at some point.
- Therefore, x must be entirely contained within z (as x ⊆ y ⊆ z).
- Because x does not touch y's boundary and y is contained in z, x cannot touch z's boundary. If x touched z's boundary, it would imply x touches y's boundary (since y's boundary includes the point of contact with z), contradicting NTPP(x,y).
- Thus, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).
- No other RCC-8 relations are possible (e.g., not TPP(x,z) because x does not touch z's boundary; not EQ(x,z) as x is a proper part of y and thus cannot equal z; not PO, EC, DC, etc., due to containment).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
