PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. The composition of EC and PO results in the set {DC, EC, PO}. Therefore, the possible relationships are:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some spatial parts but neither is a proper part of the other.

No other RCC-8 relations (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible, as they are inconsistent with the given constraints.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO
