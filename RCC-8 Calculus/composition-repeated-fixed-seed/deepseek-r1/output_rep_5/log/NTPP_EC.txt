PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be disconnected, as x is entirely contained within the interior of y without touching its boundary, and z is externally connected to y, meaning they share only a boundary point with no interior overlap. Since x is strictly interior to y and does not touch the boundary, it cannot share any points with z, including boundary points. Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
