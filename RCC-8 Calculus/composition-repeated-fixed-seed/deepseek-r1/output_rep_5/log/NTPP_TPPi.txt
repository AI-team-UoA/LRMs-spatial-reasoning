PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), the possible relationships between x and z are analyzed as follows:

- NTPP(x,y) indicates that x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y without touching its boundary).
- TPP(z,y) indicates that z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary).

The spatial constraints imply:
1. Both x and z are inside y.
2. x does not touch y's boundary, while z does.
3. x and z may be arranged in various relative positions within y.

Possible relations between x and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected (no shared parts). Possible if they are separate regions inside y.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally (share a boundary point but no interior). Possible if they touch at a point inside y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (share interior parts but neither contains the other). Possible if they overlap inside y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). Possible if x is placed inside z such that it touches z's interior boundary (not y's boundary).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z without touching z's boundary). Possible if x is entirely contained within z's interior.

Impossible relations:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Contradiction because x does not touch y's boundary, while z does.
- **TPPi(x,z)** (i.e., TPP(z,x)): Contradiction because z touches y's boundary, but if z were inside x, it would be isolated from y's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)** (i.e., NTPP(z,x)): Similarly impossible, as z would be isolated from y's boundary.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
