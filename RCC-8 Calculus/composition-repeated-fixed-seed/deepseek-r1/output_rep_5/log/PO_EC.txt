PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, and TPPi.  

- **DC(x,z)**: This is possible if x does not intersect with z at all. For example, if x overlaps y in a region away from where y and z touch, and x does not extend towards z.  
- **EC(x,z)**: This is possible if x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. For instance, if x overlaps y near the boundary where y and z touch, and x touches z at that point without overlapping.  
- **PO(x,z)**: This is possible if x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other. For example, if x extends from y into z, overlapping both regions.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is part of x and on the boundary of x, allowing EC(y,z) while PO(x,y) holds. For instance, if x contains z as a tangential part, and y touches z externally while overlapping with x.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible because it would require x and z to be coincident, but PO(x,y) implies interior overlap with y, while EC(y,z) implies no interior overlap, leading to contradiction.  
- **TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)**: Impossible because if x is a proper part of z, then the interior overlap between x and y would imply interior overlap between y and z, contradicting EC(y,z).  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Impossible because NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), so z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. However, EC(y,z) requires z to be on the boundary to touch y, but NTPP implies no boundary contact, leading to contradiction.  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Addressed above as impossible.  

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, and TPPi.

DC, EC, PO, TPPi
