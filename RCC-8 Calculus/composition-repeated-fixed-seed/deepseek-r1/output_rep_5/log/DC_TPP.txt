PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z, touches z's boundary, and y â‰  z).

Reasoning about x and z:
- Since x and y are disconnected (DC), they have no common parts.
- y is a proper part of z (TPP), so y lies entirely within z and touches z's boundary.
- x could be:
  1. **Entirely outside z**: Then DC(x,z) holds.
  2. **Externally connected to z**: x touches z's boundary but shares no interior parts. This is possible if the contact point is outside the region of y, consistent with DC(x,y). Thus, EC(x,z) is possible.
  3. **Partially overlapping z**: x overlaps with z in regions not occupied by y (since DC(x,y)), and neither is a part of the other. Hence, PO(x,z) is possible.
  4. **A tangential proper part of z**: x is entirely within z, touches z's boundary, and is not equal to z. This can occur if x is in a part of z disjoint from y. Thus, TPP(x,z) is possible.
  5. **A non-tangential proper part of z**: x is entirely within z, does not touch z's boundary, and is not equal to z. This is also possible if x is in the interior of z away from y. Hence, NTPP(x,z) is possible.
- **Impossible relations**:
  - TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a proper part of x, but then y (part of z) would overlap x, contradicting DC(x,y).
  - EQ(x,z) would imply x and z coincide, but y is part of z (and thus part of x), violating DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
