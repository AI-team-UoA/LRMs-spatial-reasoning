PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations allowed under the RCC-8 relations. TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is part of y and touches y's boundary. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected, if x and z share no points. This occurs when x is not in the region where y and z overlap, and x and z do not touch.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected, if x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior points. This occurs when x is not in the overlap region of y and z, but x and z touch at a boundary point.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping, if x and z share some interior points but neither is part of the other. This occurs when x is partially within the overlap region of y and z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, if x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This occurs when x is entirely within the overlap region of y and z and on the boundary of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part, if x is a proper part of z but does not touch z's boundary. This occurs when x is entirely within the overlap region of y and z but in the interior of z.

Relations EQ, TPPi, NTPPi are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be coincident, but x is a proper part of y and y only partially overlaps z, so x cannot equal z.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a proper part of x, but x is a small part of y, and z overlaps y without being contained by it, making this impossible.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.
