PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions. Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be the same as that between x and y. Since TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary), it follows directly that TPP(x,z) holds for z as well. No other RCC-8 relations are possible because the identity of y and z ensures consistency.
