PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:

- Both x and z are proper parts of y: x is a tangential proper part (touching y's boundary), while z is a non-tangential proper part (not touching y's boundary).
- x and z cannot be equal (EQ) because x touches y's boundary and z does not.
- x cannot be a proper part of z (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi with x as part of z) because if x were inside z, then x would not touch y's boundary (since z does not), contradicting TPP(x,y).
- z can be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)), equivalent to NTPPi(x,z), since this does not require z to touch y's boundary and is consistent with x's boundary contact.
- x and z may be disconnected (DC), externally connected (EC), or partially overlapping (PO), as these are compatible with both being inside y without violating the boundary conditions.

Thus, the possible relations are:
- DC(x,z): Disconnected.
- EC(x,z): Externally connected.
- PO(x,z): Partially overlapping.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Other relations (TPP, TPPi, NTPP, EQ) are impossible due to the boundary constraints.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, NTPPi
