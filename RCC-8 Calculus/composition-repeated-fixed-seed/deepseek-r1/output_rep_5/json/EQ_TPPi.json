{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x,y), x and y are spatially identical. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. Since x and y are identical, z must also be a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).\n\nThus, the only possible relationship is TPPi(x,z).\n\n### Answer:  \nTPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 73.18849873542786, "reasoning-tokens": 1414, "completion-tokens": 1514}
