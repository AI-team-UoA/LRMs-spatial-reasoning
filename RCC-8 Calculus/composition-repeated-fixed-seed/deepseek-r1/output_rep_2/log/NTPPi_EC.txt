PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial constraints of the RCC-8 calculus.

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary).
- EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected (i.e., they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts).

Since y is strictly inside x and not touching x's boundary, the external connection between y and z must occur at a point that is interior to x. Therefore, z must share some interior part with x, ruling out disconnected (DC), externally connected (EC), or equal (EQ) relations. Additionally, because EC(y,z) implies no interior sharing between y and z, z cannot contain x (so TPP and NTPP are impossible for x relative to z), and x cannot be part of z in a way that violates the no-interior-sharing constraint with y.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, where x and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other. This occurs if z overlaps x and touches y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is inside x and touches x's boundary). This is possible if z touches y and also touches x's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is inside x and does not touch x's boundary). This is possible if z is entirely within x, touches y, and avoids x's boundary.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
