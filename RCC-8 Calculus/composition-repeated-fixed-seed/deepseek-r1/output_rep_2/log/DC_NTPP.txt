PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The reasoning is as follows:

- **DC(x,y)**: x and y are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.
- **NTPP(y,z)**: y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely inside z and does not touch its boundary.

Possible relations for x and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: x is disconnected from z. This is possible if x is entirely outside z, as y (inside z) is disconnected from x.
- **EC(x,z)**: x is externally connected to z. This occurs if x touches the boundary of z but does not overlap its interior, and remains disconnected from y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps z. This is possible if x shares some interior parts with z but not with y (due to DC(x,y)), and neither is a part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This can happen if x is inside z and touches its boundary, while y (also inside z) is disconnected from x.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely inside z without touching its boundary, and disconnected from y.

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)** would imply z is a proper part of x, but then y (inside z) would overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).
- **EQ(x,z)** would mean x and z are coincident, but then y (inside z) would overlap with x, again contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
