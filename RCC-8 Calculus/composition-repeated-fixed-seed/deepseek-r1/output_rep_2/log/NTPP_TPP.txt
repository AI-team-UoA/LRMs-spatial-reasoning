PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary).
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is entirely within z and touches z's boundary).

Analyzing the relationship between x and z:
- x is entirely within y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- y is entirely within z (from TPP(y,z)).
- Thus, x is entirely within z.
- Since x does not touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)) and y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)), x must lie in the interior of z without touching its boundary. Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

The only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).
