PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The possible relations are:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x)).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(z,x)).

These relations are possible based on various spatial configurations where y acts as an intermediary. The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because they would imply a connection between y and z, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
