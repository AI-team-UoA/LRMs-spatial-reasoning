PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- NTPPi(x,y) implies NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning y is inside x and does not touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) implies TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Since y is entirely within the interior of x (due to NTPP(y,x)), and z is inside y (due to TPP(z,y)), z must be inside x. The boundary of y is entirely within the interior of x because y does not touch x's boundary. Therefore, z touching y's boundary does not imply that z touches x's boundary. Thus, z is entirely within the interior of x and does not touch x's boundary, making z a non-tangential proper part of x.

This corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

The RCC-8 composition table confirms that the composition of TPP(z,y) and NTPP(y,x) results in NTPP(z,x) (i.e., NTPPi(x,z)). No other relations are possible, as z must be a proper part of x and non-tangential.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
