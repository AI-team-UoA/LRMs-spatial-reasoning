PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):
- TPP(x,y) implies x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) implies y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary (entirely within z's interior).

Since x is part of y and y is part of z, x must be part of z. However:
- x touches y's boundary, but y is separated from z's boundary by a buffer (due to NTPP(y,z)).
- Thus, x does not touch z's boundary, as it is confined within y, which is interior to z.

Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
