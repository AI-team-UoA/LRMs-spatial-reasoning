PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) imply that x and y partially overlap (sharing some interior points but neither is a part of the other), and similarly for y and z. The possible relations between x and z are all eight RCC-8 relations, as demonstrated by specific spatial configurations:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected.  
  Example: x = [0,1], y = [0.5,2.5], z = [2,3] (1D intervals).  
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally.  
  Example: x = [0,1], y = [0.5,1.5], z = [1,2] (1D intervals).  
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap.  
  Example: x = [0,3], y = [1,4], z = [2,5] (1D intervals).  
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z.  
  Example: x = [0,2], y = [1,6], z = [0,5] (1D intervals).  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z.  
  Example: x = [1,2], y = [1.5,6], z = [0,5] (1D intervals).  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x.  
  Example: x = [0,5], y = [-1,3], z = [0,2] (1D intervals).  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x.  
  Example: x = [0,5], y = [1.5,6], z = [1,2] (1D intervals).  
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are equal.  
  Example: x = z = [0,2], y = [1,3] (1D intervals).  

Thus, no relation is excluded; all are possible under the constraints.
