PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same spatial region. NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is entirely contained within y and does not touch its boundary). Since x is identical to y, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is expressed as NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as the conditions uniquely determine this relationship.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
