PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The composition of NTPP and TPPi yields all relations except EQ (coincidence), as per the standard RCC-8 composition table. 

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi
