PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be DC(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions. Therefore, the disconnected relationship between x and y directly applies to x and z, meaning they share no parts.

The RCC-8 composition table confirms that the composition of DC and EQ results in DC, and no other relations are possible given the disjoint and exhaustive nature of the relations.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
