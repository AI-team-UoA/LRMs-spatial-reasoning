PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: Since x and y are disconnected and y is part of z, x could be entirely outside z, hence disconnected from z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x could touch z's boundary at a point not shared with y, allowing external connection without violating DC(x,y).
- **PO(x,z)**: x might partially overlap with z in an area not intersecting y, satisfying partial overlap.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x could be a tangential proper part of z, inside z and touching its boundary at a location distinct from y's boundary contact.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x might be a non-tangential proper part of z, entirely inside z without touching its boundary, and not overlapping with y.

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible:
- **TPPi/NTPPi**: Would imply z is part of x, but since y is part of z, y would overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).
- **EQ**: Would make x and z identical, but y is a proper part of z (hence x), violating DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
