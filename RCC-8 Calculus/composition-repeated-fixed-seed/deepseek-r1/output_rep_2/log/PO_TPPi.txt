PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations allowed under the RCC-8 calculus. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a proper part of the other. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, so z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected if z is entirely within the part of y not overlapping with x.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected if z is on the boundary of y and touches x but shares no interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap if z is partially within the overlapping region of x and y and partially outside it.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y and touches x's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x if z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y but does not touch x's boundary.

Relations such as EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and their inverses (except TPPi and NTPPi) are impossible because:
- EQ would require x and z to be equal, but z is a proper part of y and x is not fully contained in y.
- TPP or NTPP from x to z would imply x is a part of z, but z is a proper part of y and x is not fully contained in y.
- TPP or NTPP from z to x is covered by TPPi and NTPPi when applicable.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
