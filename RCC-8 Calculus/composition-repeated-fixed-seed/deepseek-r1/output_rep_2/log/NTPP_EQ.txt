PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions), the relationship between x and z must be consistent with x being a non-tangential proper part of z.

- Since y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), the spatial properties of y apply directly to z.
- NTPP(x,y) implies that x is entirely contained within y, does not touch y's boundary, and is not equal to y.
- Therefore, x must be entirely contained within z, not touch z's boundary, and not be equal to z, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x to be equal to z, but x is a proper part of y (and thus z), so they cannot be equal.
- TPP(x,z) would require x to touch z's boundary, but NTPP(x,y) specifies no boundary touching, and since y and z are equal, this cannot hold.
- Other relations like DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, or PO are inconsistent with x being entirely inside and a proper part of z without boundary touching or equality.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).
