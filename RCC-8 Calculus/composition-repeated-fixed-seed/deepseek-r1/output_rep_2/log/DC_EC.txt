PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. The composition table for RCC-8 indicates that with DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the following relations for (x,z) are possible:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, touching at a boundary but sharing no interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither is a part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

These possibilities arise because x is disconnected from y, while y and z are externally connected. This allows x to be positioned relative to z in various ways, including being disconnected, touching externally, overlapping partially, or being contained within z (either tangentially or non-tangentially). Relations like EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi are impossible because they would imply a connection between x and y, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
