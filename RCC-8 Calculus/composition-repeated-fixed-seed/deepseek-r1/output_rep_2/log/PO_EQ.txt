PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions. Since PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap (sharing some interior parts but neither being part of the other), and z is the same as y, it follows that x and z must also partially overlap. No other RCC-8 relation is possible, as explained below:

- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and y share interior points, and y = z, so x and z cannot be disconnected.
- EC(x,z) is impossible because PO involves sharing interior points, whereas EC only involves boundary contact.
- TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because PO specifies that neither x nor y (and thus z) is part of the other.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because PO(x,y) implies x and y are not equal, and y = z, so x cannot equal z.

Thus, the only possible relationship is PO(x,z).
