PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations. This is because the composition of DC with DC in the RCC-8 calculus allows for all eight relations to hold between x and z, depending on the specific spatial configuration. No restrictions are imposed by the given relations.

The possible relationships are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
