PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. Also, EC(y,z) indicates that y and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior points.  

The possible relationships between x and z are:  
- **EC(x,z)**: If z is entirely outside x and touches x at the boundary point where y contacts x.  
- **PO(x,z)**: If z partially overlaps x, sharing an interior point with x (not with y, due to EC(y,z)), and touches y at a boundary point inside x.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely inside x and touches the boundary of x (via y).  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely inside x and touches y at a point not on the boundary of x, so z does not touch x's boundary.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- DC(x,z) is excluded because z touches y, which is on x's boundary, implying x and z are not disconnected.  
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would require x to be a proper part of z, but then y (inside x) would share interior with z, violating EC(y,z).  
- EQ(x,z) would imply y is part of z, violating EC(y,z).  

Thus, the possible relations are EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.  

### Answer: EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
