PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, and TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. The possible relations between x and z are:

- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region, with y as a tangential proper part of both.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs when x and z share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other, and y is on the boundary of both in the overlap region.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This happens if z contains x and x is tangential to z's boundary, with y at the point of contact.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP). This occurs if x contains z and z is tangential to x's boundary, with y at the point of contact.

The relations DC, EC, NTPP, and NTPPi are impossible because:
- DC and EC require no shared interior, but y is part of both x and z, implying shared interior.
- NTPP and NTPPi would require y to not touch the boundary of the containing region, contradicting the tangential conditions in TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations are EQ, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

### Answer: EQ, PO, TPP, TPPi
