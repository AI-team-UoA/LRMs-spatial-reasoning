PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The possible relationships between \(x\) and \(z\) given \(\text{EC}(x,y)\) and \(\text{EC}(y,z)\) are derived from the composition of the RCC-8 relations. The composition table for \(\text{EC} \circ \text{EC}\) yields the following possibilities:  
- \(\text{DC}(x,z)\): \(x\) and \(z\) are disconnected.  
- \(\text{EC}(x,z)\): \(x\) and \(z\) are externally connected.  
- \(\text{PO}(x,z)\): \(x\) and \(z\) partially overlap.  
- \(\text{EQ}(x,z)\): \(x\) and \(z\) are coincident.  
- \(\text{TPP}(x,z)\): \(x\) is a tangential proper part of \(z\).  
- \(\text{TPPi}(x,z)\): \(z\) is a tangential proper part of \(x\) (i.e., \(\text{TPP}(z,x)\)).  

These cover all cases consistent with the given constraints.  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z)
