PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which implies TPP(z,y), both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. This means x and z are proper parts of y and both touch the boundary of y. The possible spatial relations between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and logical constraints:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are disconnected and share no common parts, e.g., separate regions touching different parts of y's boundary.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z touch externally but share no interior parts, e.g., adjacent regions both on y's boundary.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z partially overlap but neither is a proper part of the other, e.g., overlapping regions both on y's boundary.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z, e.g., x is part of z and touches z's boundary, with x still touching y's boundary via z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Possible if z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x)), e.g., z is part of x and touches x's boundary, with z still touching y's boundary via x.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are the same region.

The relations NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because:
- If NTPP(x,z), x would be a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x does not touch z's boundary. However, since z is inside y and x must touch y's boundary for TPP(x,y), x cannot be strictly interior to z without violating the tangential condition to y. Similarly for NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
