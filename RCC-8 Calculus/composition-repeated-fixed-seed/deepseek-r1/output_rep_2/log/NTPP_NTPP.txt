PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). This is because NTPP (Non-Tangential Proper Part) is transitive in the RCC-8 calculus. Specifically:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.
- Therefore, x must be entirely contained within z and cannot touch z's boundary, resulting in NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are all inconsistent with the given conditions and the transitive nature of NTPP.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
