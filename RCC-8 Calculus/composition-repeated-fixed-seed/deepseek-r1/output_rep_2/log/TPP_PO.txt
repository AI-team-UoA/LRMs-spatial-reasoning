PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of the RCC-8 relations. TPP(x,y) indicates that x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary. PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither being a part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected, if x is located entirely within the non-overlapping part of y and z and does not share any points with z.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected, if x is located in the non-overlapping part of y but shares a boundary point with z.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping, if x shares some interior points with z but is not entirely contained within z or containing z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part, if x is entirely contained within z but does not touch z's boundary.

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply that z is a proper part of x, but since x is part of y (from TPP(x,y)), this would mean z is part of y, contradicting PO(y,z) where z is not a part of y.
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are equal, but x is a proper part of y and z is not necessarily related in a way that allows equality due to the partial overlap with y.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
