PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y. Since DC(x,y) indicates that x and y share no spatial parts, and z is entirely contained within y (as a proper part), x cannot share any parts with z. If x and z shared any part, it would imply that x shares a part with y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
