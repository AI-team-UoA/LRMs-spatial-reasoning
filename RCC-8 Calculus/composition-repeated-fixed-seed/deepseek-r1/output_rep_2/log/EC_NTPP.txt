PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap occurs when x and z share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other. This is possible because x touches y at a boundary (with no interior sharing), and y is entirely inside z (without touching z's boundary), leading to x partially overlapping with z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part occurs when x is entirely inside z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible because the contact point between x and y is inside z, and x may be contained within z while touching its boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part occurs when x is entirely inside z and does not touch the boundary of z. This is possible if x is contained within the interior of z and the contact with y (which is also inside z) does not force x to touch z's boundary.

Other RCC-8 relations are not possible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because x and z share at least the contact point between x and y, which is inside z.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected is impossible because the contact point between x and y is in the interior of z, not on the boundary of z.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal is impossible because y is inside z but only externally connected to x, implying x and z cannot be the same.
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse relations (where z is a proper part of x) are impossible because if z were inside x, the contact point between x and y (which is inside z) would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y) which requires no interior sharing with y.

Thus, the only possible relations are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP
