PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected).

- **DC(x,z)**: This occurs if the point where x touches y's boundary is different from the point where z touches y's boundary (since z is a tangential proper part of y). In this case, x and z share no common points.
- **EC(x,z)**: This occurs if the point where x touches y's boundary is the same as the point where z touches y's boundary. Since z is part of y and touches y's boundary at that point, x and z will also touch at that boundary point without sharing interior parts.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- PO (partial overlap), EQ (equal), TPP (tangential proper part), NTPP (non-tangential proper part), TPPi (inverse tangential proper part), and NTPPi (inverse non-tangential proper part) all require shared interior points or containment, which cannot occur here. Specifically:
  - x is outside y (from EC(x,y)), and z is inside y (from TPPi(y,z)), so x and z cannot share interior points or have part-whole relationships.

Thus, the only possible relations are DC and EC.
