PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):  
- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x.  
- TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y.  

The composition of TPP(z,y) and TPP(y,x) results in NTPP(z,x) (non-tangential proper part), as per the RCC-8 composition table. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.  

Thus, the relation between x and z is the inverse of NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).  

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
