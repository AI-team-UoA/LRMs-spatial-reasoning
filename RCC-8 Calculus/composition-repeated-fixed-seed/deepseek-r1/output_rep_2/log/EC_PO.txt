PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPP(x,z). These are derived from the composition of the RCC-8 relations, considering spatial configurations where:
- DC(x,z) occurs if z overlaps y away from the boundary with x, resulting in no connection.
- EC(x,z) occurs if z overlaps y near the boundary with x, causing x and z to touch at a boundary without sharing interior.
- PO(x,z) occurs if z overlaps both x and y, sharing some interior with x but neither being part of the other.
- TPP(x,z) occurs if x is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., x is inside z and touches z's boundary), while y touches x externally and partially overlaps z.

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- NTPP(x,z) is excluded because if x were a non-tangential proper part of z, it would have no boundary, contradicting EC(x,y) which requires a boundary touch.
- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are excluded because if z were part of x, PO(y,z) would imply y overlaps x, contradicting EC(x,y) which requires no shared interior.
- EQ(x,z) is excluded as it would imply identical regions, inconsistent with the given distinct relations.
