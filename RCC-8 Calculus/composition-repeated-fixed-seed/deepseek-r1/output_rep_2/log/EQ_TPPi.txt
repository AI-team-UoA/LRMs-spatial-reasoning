PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) holds, x and y are identical regions. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., TPP(z,y)). Since x and y are identical, z must also be a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z), which means TPP(z,x).

This is the only possible relation, as the conditions specify a tangential proper part relationship, and no other RCC-8 relations are consistent with the given constraints.
