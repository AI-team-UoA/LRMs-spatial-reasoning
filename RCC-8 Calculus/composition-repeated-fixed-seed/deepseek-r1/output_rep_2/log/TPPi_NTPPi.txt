PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).  
- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x and touches x's boundary.  
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is part of y and does not touch y's boundary.  

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, z is entirely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary. Because y is a tangential proper part of x, y is part of x and touches x's boundary. Therefore, z must be entirely within the interior of x (as z is contained in y, which is contained in x) and cannot touch x's boundary (since z does not touch y's boundary, and y's boundary includes the points of contact with x).  

This implies that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so the relation between z and x is NTPP(z,x). Inverting this for the relation between x and z gives NTPPi(x,z).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, TPPi, and NTPP are excluded because z must be a proper part of x (ruling out DC, EC, PO, EQ) and non-tangential (ruling out TPP and TPPi). NTPP is not possible as it would imply z is a non-tangential proper part of x from z to x, but the relation from x to z is the inverse.  

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPPi(x,z).  

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
