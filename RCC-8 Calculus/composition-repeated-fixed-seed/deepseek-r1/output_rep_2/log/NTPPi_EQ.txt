PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x, not touching the boundary, and not equal to x). Also, EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions). Therefore, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x, as z is the same as y.  

The relation between x and z is thus the same as between x and y: NTPPi(x,z). This is the only possible relationship, as EQ(y,z) directly substitutes z for y without changing the spatial relation.  

Other RCC-8 relations are ruled out:  
- **DC**, **EC**: Not possible because z is inside x.  
- **PO**: Not possible because z is entirely within x and not equal to x, with no partial overlap in the reverse direction.  
- **TPP**, **NTPP**: These would imply x is a proper part of z, but z is part of x, leading to contradiction.  
- **TPPi**: This would require z to touch the boundary of x, but NTPPi implies no boundary touching.  
- **EQ**: Not possible because x and z are not equal (as y, hence z, is a proper part of x).  

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).
