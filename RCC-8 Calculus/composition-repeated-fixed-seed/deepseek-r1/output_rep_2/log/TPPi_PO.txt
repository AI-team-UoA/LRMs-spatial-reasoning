PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Additionally, PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap; they share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial Overlap. This occurs when z extends beyond x, sharing parts with both y (inside x) and regions outside x. For example, if y is inside x and z overlaps y but also has parts outside x, then x and z partially overlap.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Tangential Proper Part Inverse. This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Here, z is entirely contained in x, touches x's boundary, and overlaps y. Since y touches x's boundary, z could also touch the same boundary while overlapping y and remaining inside x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse. This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely contained in x, does not touch x's boundary, and overlaps y. For instance, z could be positioned in the interior of x, overlapping y without reaching the boundary.

Other relations are impossible:
- DC(x,z) is excluded because y is inside x and overlaps z, so x and z share parts.
- EC(x,z) is excluded because PO(y,z) implies interior overlap between y and z, and thus between x and z, which EC forbids.
- EQ(x,z) is excluded because PO(y,z) requires that y is not part of z, but if x and z were equal, y (as part of x) would be part of z, a contradiction.
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are excluded because they imply x is part of z, making y (part of x) part of z, but PO(y,z) requires that y is not part of z.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
