PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. DC(x,y) indicates that x and y are disconnected with no shared points, while PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither being a part of the other.

The possible relations for x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary but share no interior).
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

These relations are possible because the part of z not overlapped by y allows for various spatial configurations with x, which is disconnected from y. The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible due to conflicts with the given relations (e.g., if x and z were equal or if z were part of x, it would contradict DC(x,y) and PO(y,z)).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
