PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is possible if x extends beyond z while sharing some part with y (which is inside z). For example, if x overlaps y and extends outside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part is possible if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. Since y is tangential to z and x overlaps y, x might also touch the boundary of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part is possible if x is entirely within z but does not touch z's boundary. This occurs if x overlaps y and is contained deeper inside z without reaching the boundary.

Other relations are not possible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because x and y overlap, and y is inside z, so x and z share common parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected is impossible as x and z share interior parts (through the overlap of x and y inside z).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal is impossible because y is a proper part of z, and x is not equal to y (due to partial overlap), so x cannot equal z.
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverses are impossible as z cannot be a proper part of x, given that y is a proper part of z and x is not containing z entirely.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPP, and NTPP.
