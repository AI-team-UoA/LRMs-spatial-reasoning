PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (the same region), and EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts, the relationship between x and z must be identical to that between y and z. Since x and y are the same region, EC(y,z) directly implies EC(x,z). No other RCC-8 relation is possible because:
- DC is excluded since they touch.
- PO is excluded because they do not share interior parts.
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi are excluded because neither is a proper part of the other (they are distinct regions with no part-whole relationship).
- EQ is excluded because x (same as y) and z are distinct (as EC requires distinct regions).

Thus, the only possible relation is EC(x,z).
