PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) hold, meaning x and y are coincident (identical spatial regions) and y and z are coincident, it follows that x and z must also be coincident. This is due to the transitive property of the EQ relation, which is an equivalence relation. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
