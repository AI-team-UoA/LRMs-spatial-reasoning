PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).  
- NTPPi(x,y) implies NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary).  
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is entirely within z and touches z's boundary).  

To determine the possible relations between x and z:  
1. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x). Here, z is a tangential proper part of x. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and z is inside x and touches x's boundary, this configuration is possible without violating the non-tangential condition of y in x.  
2. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x). Here, z is a non-tangential proper part of x. y is inside z and touches z's boundary, but z itself does not touch x's boundary, which is consistent as y's contact with z's boundary occurs entirely within x.  
3. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. Both x and z share y as a common part, but neither is entirely contained in the other. y touches z's boundary (which lies within x), and y is a non-tangential part of x (so y does not touch x's outer boundary). This configuration is feasible.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **DC(x,z)**, **EC(x,z)**: Not possible because x and z share the region y.  
- **PO(x,z)** is already included.  
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**: x cannot be a proper part of z because if x were inside z, y (inside x) would not be able to touch z's boundary (due to y's non-tangential containment in x), contradicting TPP(y,z).  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Not possible because y would need to satisfy both NTPP(y,x) and TPP(y,x) simultaneously, which is contradictory.  

Thus, the possible relations are TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and PO(x,z).  

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), PO(x,z)
