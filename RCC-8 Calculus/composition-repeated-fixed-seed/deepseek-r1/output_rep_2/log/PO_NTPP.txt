PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:  
- **PO(x,y)**: x and y partially overlap (share some interior parts but not entirely).  
- **NTPP(y,z)**: y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z without touching its boundary).  

Since y is entirely within z, the part of x overlapping with y is also inside z. However, the part of x not overlapping with y may:  
1. **Remain entirely inside z**:  
   - If x does not touch z's boundary → **NTPP(x,z)**.  
   - If x touches z's boundary → **TPP(x,z)**.  
2. **Extend outside z**:  
   - x and z share the overlapping part (inside z) but x has parts outside z → **PO(x,z)**.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **DC(x,z)**, **EC(x,z)**: Contradicted by shared parts from PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).  
- **EQ(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: z has parts beyond y (since NTPP(y,z)), and y has parts beyond x (since PO(x,y)), so x cannot equal or contain z.  

Thus, the possible relations are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
