{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).  \n\nThis is because EQ(x,y) means x and y are spatially identical, so any relation involving y directly applies to x. Since y is externally connected to z (EC(y,z)), x must also be externally connected to z. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) imply x and z are distinct and share only a boundary with no interior overlap.  \n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 52.77055311203003, "reasoning-tokens": 948, "completion-tokens": 1063}
