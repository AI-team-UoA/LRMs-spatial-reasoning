PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the constraints that x and y share no parts, while y and z partially overlap (sharing some interior parts but neither being part of the other). The possible relations for x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, as x may not intersect z at all.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z may touch externally without sharing interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z may partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither containing the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x may be a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches its boundary).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x may be a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z without touching its boundary).

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- TPPi or NTPPi would imply z is a proper part of x, but PO(y,z) requires z to overlap y, which would force y to overlap x (contradicting DC(x,y)).
- EQ would imply x and z are identical, but DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) cannot hold simultaneously if x = z.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
