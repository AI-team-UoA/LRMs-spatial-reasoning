PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. Both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, meaning they are part of y and touch its boundary. The possible spatial relations between x and z include:

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected (x and z share no parts).
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected (x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts).
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping (x and z share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other).
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part (x is a tangential proper part of z).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of TPP (z is a tangential proper part of x).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part (x is a proper part of z and does not touch its boundary).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal (x and z are coincident).

The relation NTPPi(x,z) (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) is not possible because z must touch the boundary of y, and if z were a non-tangential proper part of x, it would not touch x's boundary. However, since x is also a tangential proper part of y, the point where z touches y's boundary would lie on x's boundary, violating the non-tangential condition.

Thus, all RCC-8 relations except NTPPi are possible between x and z.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, EQ
