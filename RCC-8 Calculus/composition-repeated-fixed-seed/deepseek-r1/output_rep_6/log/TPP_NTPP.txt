PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). This is because:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.
- Since y is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary, and x is part of y (touching y's boundary but not necessarily z's), x must be entirely within z and cannot touch z's boundary. Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are inconsistent with the transitive part-hood implied by the given relations.
- TPP(x,z) is impossible because x cannot touch z's boundary due to y not touching z's boundary.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
