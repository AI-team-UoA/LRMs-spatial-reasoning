PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: x is entirely outside z. Since y is inside z without touching its boundary and x is disconnected from y, x could be completely external to z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x touches z's boundary but shares no interior. This is possible if x is adjacent to z's boundary without overlapping y (which is inside z).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. x could intersect z in regions not containing y, as y is strictly inside z and disconnected from x.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. x could be entirely inside z, touching z's boundary, but disconnected from y (which is non-tangential and interior).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x could be entirely inside z without touching its boundary, and still disconnected from y.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Contradiction, as EQ(x,z) and NTPP(y,z) imply NTPP(y,x), but DC(x,y) requires no shared parts.
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Would imply z is inside x, but then NTPP(y,z) forces y inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
