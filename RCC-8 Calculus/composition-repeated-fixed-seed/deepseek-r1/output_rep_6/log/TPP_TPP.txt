PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This occurs if the boundary contact between x and y aligns with the boundary contact between y and z, allowing x to touch z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This occurs if the boundary contact between x and y is internal to z, so x does not touch z's boundary.

Other RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPPi, NTPPi) are impossible because:
- x is part of y and y is part of z, so x must be part of z (excluding DC, EC, PO).
- x is a proper part of y (not equal), and y is a proper part of z (not equal), so x cannot equal z (excluding EQ).
- z contains y, which contains x, so z cannot be part of x (excluding TPPi and NTPPi).

Thus, only TPP and NTPP are possible.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
