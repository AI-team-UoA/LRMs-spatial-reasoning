PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z). This is because:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary.
- Therefore, x is entirely within z and cannot touch z's boundary due to the buffer provided by y's non-tangential containment in z. Thus, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, leading to NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi are inconsistent with the given conditions, as explained:
  - DC, EC, or PO would imply disconnection or partial overlap, but x must be entirely within z.
  - EQ is impossible because x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, so x cannot equal z.
  - TPP would require x to touch z's boundary, but this is prevented by the non-tangential nature of the containments.
  - TPPi or NTPPi would imply z is part of x, which is impossible since x is smaller than y and y is smaller than z.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
