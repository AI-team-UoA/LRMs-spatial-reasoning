PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):
- EQ(x,y) implies x and y are identical spatial regions.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is entirely contained within z, not touching its boundary.
- Since x is identical to y, x must also be entirely contained within z without touching its boundary.
- Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
