PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), the relations are:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (no shared parts).
- TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary).

Since z is a part of y (due to TPP(z,y)), and x has no spatial overlap with y (due to DC(x,y)), x cannot share any parts with z. Therefore, x and z must be disconnected. No other RCC-8 relations are possible because any other relation (e.g., EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, etc.) would require some form of spatial overlap or contact, contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is DC.
