PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the constraints of the RCC-8 calculus:

- **DC(x,y)**: x and y are disjoint (no shared points).
- **TPP(y,z)**: y is a tangential proper part of z (y is entirely within z and shares a boundary point with z's boundary).

Since y is inside z, x must avoid any overlap with y. However, x may interact with z in regions outside y. The possible relations between x and z are:

1. **DC(x,z)**: x is entirely outside z.  
   *Reason: If x has no points in common with y, and y is inside z, x could be completely external to z.*  
2. **EC(x,z)**: x touches z's boundary but shares no interior points.  
   *Reason: x may contact z at a boundary point not shared with y, satisfying DC(x,y).*  
3. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other).  
   *Reason: x could extend into z's interior in regions not occupied by y.*  
4. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary).  
   *Reason: x could be contained in z, disjoint from y, and contact z's boundary at a point not on y's boundary.*  
5. **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is entirely within z but does not touch z's boundary).  
   *Reason: x could be contained deep inside z, avoiding both y and z's boundary.*

Relations that are **impossible**:  
- **EQ(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: These require z to be part of x or equal to x, contradicting DC(x,y) (since y is in z, forcing overlap with x).  
- **PO(x,y)** or similar: Already excluded by DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
