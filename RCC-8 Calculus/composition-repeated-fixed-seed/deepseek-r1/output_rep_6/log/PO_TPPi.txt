PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations. The reasoning considers that z is a tangential proper part of y (so z is inside y and touches its boundary), and x partially overlaps with y (sharing some parts but neither being a part of the other). The possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if the part of y that x overlaps does not include any part of z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This happens if x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior, which is possible if x touches the part of z that is on the boundary of y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if the overlap region between x and y includes a part of z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely contained within x but does not touch x's boundary.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(y,x), NTPPi(y,x), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- z is a proper part of y, and x is not contained in y (due to PO(x,y)), so x cannot be a part of z.
- Equality (EQ) is excluded as x and z cannot be coincident given their distinct relationships with y.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
