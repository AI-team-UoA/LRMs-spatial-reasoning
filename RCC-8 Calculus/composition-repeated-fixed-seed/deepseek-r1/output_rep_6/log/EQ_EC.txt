PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).  

This is because EQ(x,y) means x and y are spatially identical, so any relation involving y directly applies to x. Since y is externally connected to z (EC(y,z)), x must also be externally connected to z. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) imply x and z are distinct and share only a boundary with no interior overlap.  

### Answer: EC(x,z)
