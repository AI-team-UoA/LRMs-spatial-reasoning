PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be PO(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions, so the spatial relationship between x and y directly applies to x and z. Since PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap but neither is part of the other, the same holds for x and z.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as PO(x,y) rules out relations like EQ (x and y are not equal), TPP or NTPP (x is not part of y), and others due to the specific characteristics of partial overlap.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
