PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we need to find the possible relations between x and z.  
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x.  
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.  

Since y is contained in the interior of both x and z, x and z must share at least the region y, meaning they cannot be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC), as these relations imply no common interior points.  

The possible relations between x and z are those where x and z may be equal, partially overlapping, or one may be a proper part of the other (tangential or non-tangential). Specifically:  
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (equal).  
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap but neither is a part of the other.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x part of z and touches z's boundary).  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x part of z and does not touch z's boundary).  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP, so z part of x and touches x's boundary).  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP, so z part of x and does not touch x's boundary).  

These relations are all possible under the given conditions, as y being an interior part of both x and z does not restrict x and z to only one being contained within the other; they can also be equal or overlap partially.  

The relations DC and EC are impossible because y ensures x and z share interior points.

### Answer:
EQ(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
