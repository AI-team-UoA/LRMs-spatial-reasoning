PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC (Disconnected) or EC (Externally Connected).

- **Reasoning**:  
  - EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.  
  - TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary).  
  - Since z is inside y and x is outside y (touching only at the boundary), x and z can only be either:  
    - **DC(x,z)**: If the point where x touches y is not where z touches y's boundary, making x and z disconnected.  
    - **EC(x,z)**: If the point where x touches y coincides with where z touches y's boundary, causing x and z to touch externally without sharing interior.  
  - Other RCC-8 relations (PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are impossible because x and z cannot share interior (as x is disjoint from y's interior) or have part-whole relationships (since x is outside y and z is inside y).
