PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and shares a boundary with x). Also given PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap (share interior parts but neither is part of the other).

The possible relations between x and z are:

1. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs if z extends outside x (so z is not a subset of x) and overlaps x in the region where y and z overlap. Example: x is a large circle, y is a small circle inside x touching its boundary, and z overlaps y but also extends outside x.
2. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and shares a boundary with x). This occurs if z is entirely within x, touches x's boundary, and overlaps y. Example: x is a large circle, y is a small circle inside x touching its boundary, and z is another circle inside x touching the boundary and overlapping y.
3. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is part of x but does not touch its boundary). This occurs if z is entirely within the interior of x and overlaps y. Example: x is a large circle, y is a small circle inside x touching its boundary, and z is a circle entirely in the interior of x overlapping y.

These relations are possible because:
- The overlap between y and z ensures x and z share interior parts (ruling out DC and EC).
- x cannot be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP) because that would imply y is part of z, contradicting PO(y,z).
- EQ is impossible because y is a proper part of x but not coincident with z (from PO(y,z)).

Thus, the possible relationships are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
