PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). This is because:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is within z and touches z's boundary at some points.
Since x is contained in the interior of y and y is contained in z, x must be contained in the interior of z. Additionally, because x does not touch the boundary of y and the interior of y is entirely within the interior of z, x does not touch the boundary of z. Thus, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, leading to NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are excluded because x must be a proper part of z without boundary contact.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
