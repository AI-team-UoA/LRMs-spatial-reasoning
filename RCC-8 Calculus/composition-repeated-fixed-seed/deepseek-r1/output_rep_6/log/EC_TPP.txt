PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. The composition EC âˆ˜ TPP results in the following possible relations: EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

- **EC(x,z)**: This is possible if x and z are externally connected, sharing only a boundary point but no interior parts. For example, if x touches y at a point on z's boundary and does not overlap or enter z's interior.
- **PO(x,z)**: This is possible if x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a part of the other. For example, if x extends beyond the contact point with y to overlap with z in another area.
- **TPP(x,z)**: This is possible if x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z and touches z's boundary. For example, if x is inside z and adjacent to y at the boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: This is possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. For example, if x is inside z and not on the boundary, but still connected to y.

The relations DC, EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi are impossible because:
- DC is excluded since x and z must be connected through the point of contact with y.
- EQ is excluded as y is a proper part of z, and x is distinct from y and z.
- TPPi and NTPPi would imply z is part of x, but this contradicts EC(x,y), which requires that y is not part of x.

Thus, the possible relationships are EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
