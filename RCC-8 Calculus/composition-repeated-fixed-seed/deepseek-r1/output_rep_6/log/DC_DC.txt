PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), meaning that x and y are disconnected and share no parts, and y and z are disconnected and share no parts, there are no restrictions on the possible relationship between x and z. All eight RCC-8 relations are possible, as the disconnection from y does not constrain how x and z relate spatially. The possible relationships are:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (equal).

This is because spatial configurations exist for each case where y is disconnected from both x and z, yet x and z can have any of these relations.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
