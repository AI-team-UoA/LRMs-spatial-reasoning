PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely contained within y and does not touch its boundary).
- NTPPi(y,z): equivalent to NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely contained within y and does not touch its boundary).

Both x and z are entirely contained within y's interior. The possible spatial relationships between x and z are not restricted beyond this containment, as x and z can be arranged in any relative configuration within y. All RCC-8 relations are possible:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch externally but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches its boundary).
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is entirely within z's interior).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident (equal).

Thus, all eight relations are possible.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPP(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
