PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:  
- TPPi(x,y) implies TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary).  
- DC(y,z) indicates y and z share no common parts.  

Considering the spatial arrangement:  
- **DC(x,z)**: z is entirely disconnected from x. This is possible since y is inside x, but z may be outside, avoiding y.  
- **EC(x,z)**: z touches x's boundary externally. Since y touches x's boundary, z can touch a different part of the boundary, avoiding y.  
- **PO(x,z)**: z partially overlaps x. The overlap must avoid y, which is possible if z overlaps a region of x not containing y.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z inside x, touching boundary). z must be disconnected from y, which is feasible if z and y occupy non-overlapping regions inside x.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z inside x, not touching boundary). Similarly, z can be disconnected from y within x.  

Impossible relations:  
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, or **EQ(x,z)**: These imply x is part of z or coincident with z, forcing y (as part of x) to overlap with z, contradicting DC(y,z).  

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
