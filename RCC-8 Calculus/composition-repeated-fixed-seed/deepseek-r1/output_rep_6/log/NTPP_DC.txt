PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), we analyze the possible relationships between x and z.

- NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely contained within the interior of y (x is a non-tangential proper part of y), so every point of x is a point of y.
- DC(y,z) means y and z share no points (they are disconnected).

Since x is entirely within y and y has no points in common with z, it follows that x and z must also share no points. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relation is possible because:
- EC(x,z) would require x and z to touch at a boundary, but this would imply a point common to both x and z (and thus to y and z, contradicting DC(y,z)).
- PO(x,z) would require overlapping interiors, impossible due to DC(y,z).
- TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ would imply that x is part of z or vice versa, requiring shared points, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
