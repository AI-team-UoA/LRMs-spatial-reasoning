PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(y,x)). Also, given EQ(y,z), which means that y and z are identical (i.e., z is the same region as y). Therefore, since z is identical to y, and y is a tangential proper part of x, it follows that z is also a tangential proper part of x. This means that TPP(z,x) holds, which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as the equality EQ(y,z) directly substitutes z for y in the relation with x.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
