PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the RCC-8 composition table. The relations are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected (e.g., y is between x and z, and they do not touch).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected (e.g., x, y, z form a configuration where x and z share a boundary segment).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (e.g., x and z share interior parts but neither is part of the other, arranged such that both touch y but extend to overlap each other).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (e.g., x is inside z and touches z's boundary, while y is externally connected to both).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (e.g., z is inside x and touches x's boundary, using disconnected regions to satisfy the EC relations).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (e.g., x is inside z without touching its boundary, achieved with specific disconnected region configurations).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (e.g., z is inside x without touching its boundary, similarly with disconnected regions).

EQ(x,z) is not possible, as it would imply x and z are the same region, which contradicts the EC relations with y.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, NTPPi
