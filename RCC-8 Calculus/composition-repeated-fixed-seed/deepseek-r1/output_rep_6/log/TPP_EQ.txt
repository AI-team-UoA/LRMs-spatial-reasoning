PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be TPP(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical, so the relation TPP(x,y) directly translates to TPP(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
