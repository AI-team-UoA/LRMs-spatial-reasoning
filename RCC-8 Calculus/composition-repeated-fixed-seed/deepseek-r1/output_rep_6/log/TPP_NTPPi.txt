PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), both x and z are proper parts of y. Specifically, x is a tangential proper part of y (touching y's boundary), and z is a non-tangential proper part of y (strictly interior to y, not touching y's boundary).

The possible relationships between x and z are determined by their spatial configurations relative to each other within y:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. Possible if x and z are separated within y, sharing no points.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. Possible if x and z touch at a boundary point that is internal to y (not on y's boundary), with no interior overlap.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping. Possible if x and z share some interior points but neither is a part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Possible if z is part of x and touches x's boundary at a point not on y's boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Possible if z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

The following relations are impossible:
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**: Impossible because x has points on y's boundary, while z is strictly interior; if x were part of z, x would be interior to y, contradicting TPP(x,y).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible because x and z have different boundary relations with y (x touches boundary, z does not).
- Other relations (like TPP or NTPP from x to z) are excluded for similar reasons.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
