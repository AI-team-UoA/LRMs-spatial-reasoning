{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x) (y is a tangential proper part of x).  \nGiven EQ(y,z), which means y and z are coincident (identical).  \n\nSince y and z are identical, substituting z for y in TPP(y,x) gives TPP(z,x).  \nTPP(z,x) is equivalent to TPPi(x,z) by definition.  \n\nTherefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).  \n\n### Answer: TPPi(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 42.696781873703, "reasoning-tokens": 1182, "completion-tokens": 1295}
