{"prompt": "If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions. Therefore, the spatial relation between x and z is the same as that between x and y, which is partial overlap (PO).\n\n### Answer: PO(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 48.83124327659607, "reasoning-tokens": 1344, "completion-tokens": 1418}
