PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition. TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is part of y and touches y's boundary. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being a part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected if x is entirely outside the overlapping region of y and z and not touching z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior if x is at the boundary of y and z but not in the overlap.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap if x is partially within and partially outside the overlapping region of y and z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within the overlapping region and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within the overlapping region but does not touch z's boundary.

Relations such as EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) are not possible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but x is a proper part of y and y only partially overlaps z, so z cannot be identical to x.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a proper part of x, but x is a proper part of y and thus cannot contain z, which overlaps y but is not contained by it.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
