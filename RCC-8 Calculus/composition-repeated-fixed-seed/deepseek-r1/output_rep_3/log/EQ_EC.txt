PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) holds, x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same region. Since EC(y,z) holds, y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. Because x is identical to y, the relationship between x and z is the same as that between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is EC(x,z).
