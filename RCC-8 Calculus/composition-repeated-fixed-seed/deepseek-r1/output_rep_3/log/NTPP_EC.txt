PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z):
- NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.

Since x is strictly inside y (away from its boundary) and y only touches z externally (with no shared interior), x and z have no spatial overlap or contact. Therefore:
- x and z must be disconnected (DC), as they share no points.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EC(x,z)**: Requires touching boundaries, but x is not on y's boundary, so it cannot touch z.
- **PO(x,z)**: Requires partial overlap, but x is inside y and z is outside y (except boundary contact), so no shared interior.
- **TPP/NTPP/TPPi/NTPPi**: Require part-whole relationships, but x and z are disjoint.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Requires coincidence, which is impossible due to disjointness.

Thus, the only possible relation is **DC(x,z)**.
