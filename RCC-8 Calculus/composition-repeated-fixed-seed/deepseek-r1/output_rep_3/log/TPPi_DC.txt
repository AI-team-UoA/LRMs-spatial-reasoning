PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary). Also, DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no parts. The possible relations between x and z are:

1. **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if z is entirely outside x.  
2. **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally but share no interior parts. This is possible if z touches x's boundary at a point not shared with y.  
3. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z overlaps with x in a region that does not intersect y.  
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is inside x and touches its boundary, without intersecting y.  
5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely inside x without touching its boundary and does not intersect y.  

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:  
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is part of z, making y part of z (since y is part of x), contradicting DC(y,z).  
- EQ(x,z) would make DC(y,z) imply DC(y,x), but y is part of x, so they cannot be disconnected.  

Thus, the possible relations are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).  

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
