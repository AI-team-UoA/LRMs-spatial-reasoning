PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. EC(x,y) indicates that x and y are externally connected (touching at boundaries with no interior overlap). PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap (sharing some interior parts but neither is a subset of the other).

The composition EC o PO results in the following possible relations for x and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected (no shared parts). This occurs if z does not interact with the boundary where x and y touch, and z's parts outside y avoid x.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected (touching at boundaries). This occurs if z overlaps y near the boundary with x, causing x and z to touch at a boundary without interior overlap.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping (sharing interior parts). This occurs if z extends into regions adjacent to x, leading to shared interior points between x and z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part (x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary). This occurs if z encompasses x and y, with x touching z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part (x is a proper part of z without touching z's boundary). This occurs if z encompasses x and y with a buffer between x and z's boundary.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of TPP (z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary). This occurs in scenarios like x having a hole containing y, and z partially overlaps y while being entirely inside x, touching x's inner boundary.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of NTPP (z is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary). This occurs similarly to TPPi, but with z fully inside x and not touching the boundary.

The relation EQ(x,z) (coincidence) is impossible, as x and z cannot be identical given the constraints. Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi
