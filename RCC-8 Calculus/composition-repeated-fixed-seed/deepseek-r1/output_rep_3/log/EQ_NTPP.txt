PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are identical regions. Given NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is entirely contained within z and does not touch its boundary). Since x and y are identical, x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
