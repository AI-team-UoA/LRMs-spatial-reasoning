PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x and touches the boundary of x. Also given PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap; they share some interior points but neither is a part of the other.

The possible relationships between x and z are derived from the spatial constraints:
- Since y is part of x and shares interior points with z, x and z must share some interior points. Therefore, disconnected (DC) and externally connected (EC) are impossible.
- Equal (EQ) is impossible because if x and z were equal, PO(y,z) would imply partial overlap between y and x, but TPP(y,x) means y is a proper part of x, contradicting PO.
- If x were a part of z (e.g., TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)), then y (as part of x) would be part of z, contradicting PO(y,z), which requires that neither is part of the other. Thus, TPPi and NTPPi are impossible.

The remaining possibilities are:
1. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. This occurs when z is not entirely contained within x, so x and z share interior points but neither is part of the other. For example, z may overlap y and extend outside x.
2. **TPP(z,x)**: z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs when z is entirely contained within x and touches the boundary of x. For example, z may overlap y and be positioned such that it touches x's boundary.
3. **NTPP(z,x)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs when z is entirely contained within x but does not touch the boundary of x. For example, z may overlap y and be positioned in the interior of x, away from the boundary.

All three are possible given the initial relations, as the tangency of y does not restrict z from being tangential, non-tangential, or extending outside x.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x)
