PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident (identical regions). Given TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary). Since x and y are identical, substituting y with x in TPP(z,y) gives TPP(z,x). Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

Thus, the possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
