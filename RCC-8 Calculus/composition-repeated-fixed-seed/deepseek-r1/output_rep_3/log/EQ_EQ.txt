PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), meaning x is coincident with y and y is coincident with z, by transitivity of spatial coincidence, x must be coincident with z. Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is EQ(x,z).  

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
