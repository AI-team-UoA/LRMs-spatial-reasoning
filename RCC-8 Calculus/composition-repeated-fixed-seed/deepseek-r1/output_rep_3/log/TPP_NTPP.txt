PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:

- **TPP(x,y)** implies x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- **NTPP(y,z)** implies y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x is a part of y and y is a part of z, x must be a proper part of z. However, x does not touch z's boundary because:
- y is entirely contained within z's interior (non-tangentially), so y's boundary (which x touches) is not at z's boundary.
- Thus, x is inside z without touching z's boundary.

This corresponds to **NTPP(x,z)**.

The RCC-8 composition table confirms that TPP composed with NTPP results only in NTPP. Therefore, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
