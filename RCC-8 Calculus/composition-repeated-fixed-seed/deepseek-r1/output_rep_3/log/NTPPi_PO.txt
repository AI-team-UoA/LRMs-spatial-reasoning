PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x and does not touch its boundary). Also given PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial parts, but neither is a part of the other).

The possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap if z has parts both inside and outside x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x (z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is completely inside x and does not touch its boundary).

These are the only possible relations because:
- y is entirely within x, and z overlaps y, so x and z must share interior points, ruling out DC and EC.
- z cannot contain x, and x cannot be a part of z, due to PO(y,z) implying y is not a subset of z and z is not a subset of y, which would be violated if x were part of z or vice versa.
- EQ is impossible because y is a proper part of x, and z overlaps y but is not equal to x.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi for the pair (x,z).

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
