PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x.

Given TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z. This implies y is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z.

The possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some common interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other. This is possible because y is inside x and touches z's boundary, and z may extend outside x while still overlapping with x.
  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible because z could be entirely within x and touch x's boundary, with y inside z touching z's boundary at a point not on x's boundary.
  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible because z could be entirely within the interior of x, not touching x's boundary, with y inside z touching z's boundary.

The relations DC, EC, TPP, NTPP, TPPi (from z to x, but already covered as TPPi for x and z), NTPPi (similarly covered), and EQ are impossible:
- DC and EC are impossible because x and z share y as a common part.
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because if x were a proper part of z, y (inside x and not touching x's boundary) could not touch z's boundary, contradicting TPP(y,z).
- EQ is impossible because y is a proper part of both x and z in different ways (non-tangential for x, tangential for z).

Thus, the possible relations are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
