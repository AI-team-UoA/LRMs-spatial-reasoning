PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations NTPPi(x,y) (equivalent to NTPP(y,x)) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, where x and z share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Tangential proper part inverse, meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is entirely contained in x and touches the boundary of x).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part inverse, meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is entirely contained in x and does not touch the boundary of x).

These possibilities arise because y is entirely inside x (due to NTPP(y,x)) and touches z at a boundary (EC(y,z)). This configuration allows z to overlap partially with x, be contained within x tangentially, or be contained within x non-tangentially. Other RCC-8 relations are excluded:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and z must share a point (via y).
- EC(x,z) is impossible because the contact point between y and z is in the interior of x, not on the boundary of x.
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because they would require the contact point to be in the interior of z, contradicting EC(y,z) which requires the point to be on the boundary of z.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because y is inside x but not touching the boundary, while EC(y,z) requires contact, implying x and z cannot be identical.
