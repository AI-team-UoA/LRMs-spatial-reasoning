PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined as follows:

- **NTPP(y,z)**: y is entirely contained within the interior of z, meaning no part of y touches the boundary of z.
- **EC(x,y)**: x and y share a boundary point but have no interior overlap.

Since y is strictly inside z (interior of z), the boundary point shared between x and y must also lie within the interior of z. Therefore, x must have at least this point in common with z, ruling out DC (disconnected). 

Possible relations:
- **PO (partial overlap)**: If x is partially inside and partially outside z, they share interior points (since the shared boundary point of x and y is interior to z, and by the properties of regions, x must have interior points overlapping with z).
- **TPP (tangential proper part)**: If x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z.
- **NTPP (non-tangential proper part)**: If x is entirely contained within z and does not touch the boundary of z.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC**: Excluded because x and z share the boundary point of x and y, which is inside z.
- **EC**: Requires sharing only a boundary point of both regions, but the shared point is interior to z, not on its boundary.
- **EQ**: Would imply x equals z, but y is inside z without touching its boundary, while EC(x,y) requires no interior overlap, leading to contradiction.
- **TPPi/NTPPi**: Would imply z is a proper part of x, but then y (inside z) would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y) which forbids interior overlap.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP
