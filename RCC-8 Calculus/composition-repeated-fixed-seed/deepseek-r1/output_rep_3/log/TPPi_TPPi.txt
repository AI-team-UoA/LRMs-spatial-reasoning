PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):  
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x.  
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.  

Thus:  
- z is inside y, and y is inside x.  
- z must be inside x, so the possible relations between x and z are those where z is a proper part of x.  

Possible cases:  
1. **z touches x's boundary**: If z is positioned such that it contacts the boundary of x (e.g., through y's contact with x), then TPP(z,x) holds. This is equivalent to **TPPi(x,z)**.  
2. **z does not touch x's boundary**: If z is entirely within the interior of x (not contacting x's boundary), then NTPP(z,x) holds. This is equivalent to **NTPPi(x,z)**.  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as z must be a proper part of x (ruling out DC, EC, PO, EQ), and the directionality (from z to x) ensures TPPi or NTPPi for x to z.  

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z)
