PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the RCC-8 composition. The relations are:

- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This occurs if x and z are the same region.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is part of the other. This is possible when x and z have a common part (y) on their boundaries.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This occurs if z contains x and x touches the boundary of z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if x contains z and z touches the boundary of x.

The relations DC, EC, NTPP, and NTPPi are impossible because:
- DC and EC require no shared interior parts, but y is a common part of x and z, implying interior overlap.
- NTPP and NTPPi would imply one region is entirely within the interior of the other without touching the boundary, but y touches the boundaries of both x and z, leading to a contradiction.

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are EQ, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

### Answer:
EQ, PO, TPP, TPPi
