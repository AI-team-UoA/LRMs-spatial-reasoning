PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the relationship between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations. This is because the disconnectedness of y from both x and z does not impose any restrictions on the spatial relation between x and z. All eight relations are possible, as demonstrated by various spatial configurations:

- **DC(x,z)**: x, y, and z are all mutually disconnected (e.g., three separate circles).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally, while y is disconnected from both (e.g., x and z are adjacent circles, y is separate).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, while y is disconnected from both (e.g., x and z are overlapping circles, y is separate).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, while y is disconnected from both (e.g., x is a small circle on the boundary of a larger circle z, y is separate).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, while y is disconnected from both (e.g., x is entirely inside z without touching the boundary, y is separate).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP), while y is disconnected from both (e.g., z is a small circle on the boundary of a larger circle x, y is separate).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP), while y is disconnected from both (e.g., z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary, y is separate).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident, while y is disconnected from both (e.g., x and z are the same region, y is separate).

Thus, no RCC-8 relation is excluded by the given conditions.
