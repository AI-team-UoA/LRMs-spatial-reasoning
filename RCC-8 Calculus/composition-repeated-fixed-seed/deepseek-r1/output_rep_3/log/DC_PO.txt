PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.  

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are spatially separated, with no common points.  
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x touches z at a boundary but shares no interior points, and x is not connected to y.  
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points but neither is part of the other, and the overlap occurs in a region of z not shared with y.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is part of z and touches z's boundary, and x is contained in a part of z not overlapping with y.  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary, and x is contained in a part of z not overlapping with y.  

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible because they would imply a connection between x and y (contradicting DC(x,y)) via z. For example:  
- If TPPi(x,z) (i.e., TPP(z,x)), z is part of x, and since PO(y,z) implies y and z share points, y and x must share points, violating DC(x,y).  
- Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) or EQ(x,z) would force a connection between x and y.  

Thus, the only possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer:  
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
