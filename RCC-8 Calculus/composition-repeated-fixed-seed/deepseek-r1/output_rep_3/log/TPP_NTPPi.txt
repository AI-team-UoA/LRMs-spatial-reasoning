PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts.  
  Example: x is near the boundary of y, z is in the interior, and they do not touch.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally but share no interior parts.  
  Example: x and z are adjacent within y but do not overlap.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is part of the other.  
  Example: x and z overlap in a region interior to both.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x.  
  Example: z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary (which is interior to y).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x.  
  Example: z is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary.

These relations are possible because:
- Both x and z are proper parts of y (x tangentially, z non-tangentially).
- Their relative positions within y allow for disjointness, contact, overlap, or containment (with z inside x, but not vice versa, due to x touching y's boundary while z does not).

Impossible relations:
- **TPP(x,z)** or **NTPP(x,z)**: x cannot be part of z because x touches y's boundary, but z is entirely interior to y and would force x to be interior, contradicting TPP(x,y).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z cannot be equal because x touches y's boundary while z does not.

### Answer:  
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
