PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z):

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely within x, does not touch x's boundary, and y â‰  x.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical), so z has all the same spatial properties as y.

Therefore, since y is a non-tangential proper part of x and z is identical to y, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible, as z is a proper part of x and cannot be equal to x.
- TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z) are impossible, as the non-tangential aspect is preserved (z does not touch x's boundary).
- Other relations like DC, EC, PO, etc., are inconsistent with z being entirely within x as a non-tangential proper part.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).
