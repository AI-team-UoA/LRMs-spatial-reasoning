PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z):
- NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- DC(y,z) means y and z share no spatial parts and are disconnected.

Since x is entirely contained within y, and y is completely disconnected from z, x cannot share any part with z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
