PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are analyzed as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: x is disconnected from z. This is possible if x is entirely outside z, as y is inside z but disconnected from x.
- **EC(x,z)**: x touches z at a boundary but shares no interior parts. This is possible if x contacts a boundary part of z not adjacent to y, maintaining DC(x,y).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither being part of the other. This is possible if x overlaps with a part of z that excludes y, without violating DC(x,y).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z, touches its boundary, and is separated from y inside z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely within z, not touching its boundary, and disconnected from y.

The relations TPPi(x,z) (equivalent to TPP(z,x)), NTPPi(x,z) (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because they would imply z is part of x or coincident with x, forcing y to be part of x and violating DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
