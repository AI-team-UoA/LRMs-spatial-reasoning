PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions. Therefore, the spatial relation between x and z is the same as that between x and y, which is partial overlap (PO).

### Answer: PO(x,z)
