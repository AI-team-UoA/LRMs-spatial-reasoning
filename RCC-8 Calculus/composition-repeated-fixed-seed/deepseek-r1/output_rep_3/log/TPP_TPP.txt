PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

- TPP(x,z) occurs when x touches the boundary of z. This can happen if x touches y at the same point where y touches z, allowing x to directly touch z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z) occurs when x does not touch the boundary of z. This can happen if x touches y at a point interior to z, so x is entirely within the interior of z.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as x must be a proper part of z (due to transitivity of part-of), and EQ, PO, DC, EC, TPPi, and NTPPi are excluded based on the given relations.

### Answer:
TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z)
