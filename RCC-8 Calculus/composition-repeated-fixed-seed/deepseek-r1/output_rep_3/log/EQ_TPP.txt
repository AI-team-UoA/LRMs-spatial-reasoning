PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the premises EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z):

- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (i.e., identical spatial regions).
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is part of z, y touches z's boundary, and y is not equal to z).

Since x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), the relationship between x and z must be the same as the relationship between y and z. Therefore, TPP(y,z) directly implies TPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be equal, but TPP(y,z) implies y ≠ z, and since x = y, x ≠ z.
- Other relations like DC, EC, PO, NTPP, TPPi, or NTPPi do not hold, as they would contradict x being a proper part of z and touching its boundary (as derived from y's relation to z).

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
