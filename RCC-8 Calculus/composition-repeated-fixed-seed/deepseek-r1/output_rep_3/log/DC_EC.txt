PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. Based on the RCC-8 composition table:

- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected with no shared parts.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.

The possible relations for x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (share some parts but neither is part of the other).
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary).

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply that z is part of x, but since y touches z and x is disconnected from y, this would contradict DC(x,y) (as y touching z would imply y touches x if z is part of x).
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are coincident, but this would imply that y touches x (since EC(y,z)), contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP for x and z.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
