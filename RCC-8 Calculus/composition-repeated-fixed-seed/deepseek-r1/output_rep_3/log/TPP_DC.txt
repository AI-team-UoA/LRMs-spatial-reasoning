PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), we analyze the possible relationships between x and z.

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is entirely contained within y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected: they share no points (no boundary or interior points).

Since x is entirely contained within y (due to TPP(x,y)), and y shares no points with z (due to DC(y,z)), x cannot share any points with z. Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.

Now, consider other RCC-8 relations to confirm no other possibilities:
- **EC(x,z)**: Requires x and z to touch at a boundary but share no interior. However, x is inside y, and y has no contact with z, so EC is impossible.
- **PO(x,z)**: Requires partial overlap (sharing interior points but neither contained in the other). Since x is inside y and y is disjoint from z, no overlap can occur.
- **TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)**: Require x to be a proper part of z. But x is inside y, and y is disjoint from z, so x cannot be part of z.
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Require z to be a proper part of x. However, x is a proper part of y (so smaller than y), and z is disjoint from y, so z cannot be part of x.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Requires x and z to be the same region. But x is part of y, and y is disjoint from z, so x cannot equal z.

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
