PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), this means:
- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and does not touch x's boundary).
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary).

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. This is because:
- The non-tangential proper part relation (NTPP) is transitive in the RCC-8 calculus.
- z being entirely contained within y and not touching y's boundary, combined with y being entirely contained within x and not touching x's boundary, ensures that z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be equal, but z is a proper part of x.
- PO(x,z) would imply partial overlap without full containment, but z is fully contained in x.
- TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z) would require z to touch x's boundary, but the non-tangential condition prevents this.
- NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a part of z, which is not possible as z is smaller.
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) would require separation or external contact, but there is containment.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
