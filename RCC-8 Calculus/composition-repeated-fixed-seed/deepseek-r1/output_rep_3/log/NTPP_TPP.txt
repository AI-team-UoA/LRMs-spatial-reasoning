PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). This is because:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is within z and touches z's boundary.
- Since x is contained within y and does not touch y's boundary, and y is contained within z (touching z's boundary), x must be entirely within z and cannot touch z's boundary. Thus, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, leading to NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, and PO are excluded because x is part of z.
- EQ is excluded because x and z cannot be coincident (x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z).
- TPP, TPPi, NTPPi are excluded because x must be non-tangential to z, and z cannot be part of x.
