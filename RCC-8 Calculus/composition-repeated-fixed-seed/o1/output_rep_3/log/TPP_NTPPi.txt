PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)

Explanation (not to be included in the final answer):
• From TPP(x,y) we know x is a proper part of y and their boundaries intersect.  
• From NTPPi(y,z) (“the inverse of NTPP”), we know y is a proper part of z and their boundaries do not intersect.  
• By transitivity, x is also a proper part of z.  
• Because y’s boundary lies strictly inside z (no boundary contact), and x’s boundary lies on y’s boundary, x’s boundary cannot reach z’s boundary.  
• Hence x is a non‐tangential proper part of z: NTPP(x,z).
