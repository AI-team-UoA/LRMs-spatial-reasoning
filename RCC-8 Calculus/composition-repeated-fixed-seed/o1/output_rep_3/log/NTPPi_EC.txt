PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:
They can be externally connected, partially overlapping, or else z can be a proper part of x (tangentially or non‐tangentially).  
In RCC‐8 terms, the possible relations are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).
