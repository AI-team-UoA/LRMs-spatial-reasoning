PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer:  
All eight RCC‐8 relations remain possible between x and z.  Being (non‐tangential) proper parts of y places no restriction on whether x and z are disjoint, merely touch, partially overlap, one is (tangentially or non‐tangentially) contained in the other, or they coincide.
