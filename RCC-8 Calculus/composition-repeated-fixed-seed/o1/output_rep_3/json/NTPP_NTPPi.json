{"prompt": "If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "### Answer:  \nAll eight RCC\u20108 relations remain possible between x and z.  Being (non\u2010tangential) proper parts of y places no restriction on whether x and z are disjoint, merely touch, partially overlap, one is (tangentially or non\u2010tangentially) contained in the other, or they coincide.", "elapsed-time": 63.73908710479736, "reasoning-tokens": 7296, "completion-tokens": 7430}
