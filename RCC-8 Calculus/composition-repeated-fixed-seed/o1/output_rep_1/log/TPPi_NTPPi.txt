PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)

Explanation (informal):  
• TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (so y is wholly inside x but their boundaries touch).  
• NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (so z is wholly inside y and their boundaries do not touch).  

Because z lies entirely inside y, and y lies entirely (tangentially) inside x, z cannot reach x’s boundary without first meeting y’s boundary. But z does not meet y’s boundary at all (it is non-tangentially inside y). Hence z also lies wholly inside x without touching x’s boundary. In RCC-8 terms, that is precisely “z is a non-tangential proper part of x,” i.e. NTPP(z,x), or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).
