{"prompt": "If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)\n\nExplanation (informal):  \n\u2022 TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (so y is wholly inside x but their boundaries touch).  \n\u2022 NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (so z is wholly inside y and their boundaries do not touch).  \n\nBecause z lies entirely inside y, and y lies entirely (tangentially) inside x, z cannot reach x\u2019s boundary without first meeting y\u2019s boundary. But z does not meet y\u2019s boundary at all (it is non-tangentially inside y). Hence z also lies wholly inside x without touching x\u2019s boundary. In RCC-8 terms, that is precisely \u201cz is a non-tangential proper part of x,\u201d i.e. NTPP(z,x), or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 102.70793294906616, "reasoning-tokens": 7744, "completion-tokens": 7990}
