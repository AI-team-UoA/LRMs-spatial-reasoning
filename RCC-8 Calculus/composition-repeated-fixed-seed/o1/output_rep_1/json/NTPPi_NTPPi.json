{"prompt": "If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)\n\nExplanation (not part of the final answer):  \nNTPPi(x,y) says that y is a non\u2010tangential proper part of x (y \u2282 x, with no shared boundary). Likewise, NTPPi(y,z) says that z is a non\u2010tangential proper part of y (z \u2282 y, no shared boundary). Because y itself lies strictly within x and z lies strictly within y, it follows that z also lies strictly within x, again with no boundary contact. Consequently, z is a non\u2010tangential proper part of x, i.e. NTPPi(x,z).", "elapsed-time": 74.15610814094543, "reasoning-tokens": 5248, "completion-tokens": 5445}
