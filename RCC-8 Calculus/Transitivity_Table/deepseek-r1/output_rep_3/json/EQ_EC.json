{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident (identical regions). Given EC(y,z), y and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary but share no interior parts). Since x is identical to y, the relationship between x and z must be the same as between y and z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is EC(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 33.009185552597046, "reasoning-tokens": 554, "completion-tokens": 638}
