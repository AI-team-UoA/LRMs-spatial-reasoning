PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are spatially coincident, meaning they are identical. Given NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is entirely contained within y and does not touch its boundary.

Since x and y are identical, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because z is a proper part of y (and thus x), not equal.
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, or TPPi are not consistent with the given relations, as z is entirely within x and non-tangential.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
