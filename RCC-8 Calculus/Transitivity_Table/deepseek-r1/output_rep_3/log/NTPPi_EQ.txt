PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.

Given EQ(y,z), which means y and z are identical spatial regions.

Since z is identical to y, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), meaning NTPP(z,x).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible since y (and thus z) is a proper part of x, not equal to x.
- PO(x,z) is impossible because z is entirely within x, not partially overlapping.
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) are impossible because z shares interior parts with x.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) are impossible because these would imply x is a part of z, but z is part of x and smaller.
- TPPi(x,z) is impossible because TPPi would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, but here z is non-tangential.

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPPi(x,z).
