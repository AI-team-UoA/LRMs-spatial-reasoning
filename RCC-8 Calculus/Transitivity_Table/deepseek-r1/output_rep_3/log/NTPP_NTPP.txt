PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:

- NTPP(x,y) implies x is entirely contained within the interior of y (no boundary contact).
- NTPP(y,z) implies y is entirely contained within the interior of z (no boundary contact).
- Therefore, x must be entirely contained within the interior of z, as x is inside y and y is inside z.
- This containment is strict (proper part) because x ≠ y and y ≠ z, so x ≠ z.
- Since x is in the interior of z and does not touch its boundary, the relation must be NTPP(x,z).

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- DC, EC: Require separation or boundary contact, but x is inside z.
- PO: Requires partial overlap without full containment, but x is fully contained in z.
- TPP: Requires touching the boundary, but x is interior to z.
- TPPi, NTPPi: Would imply z is part of x, but x is smaller than y and y smaller than z.
- EQ: x and z are not equal.

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).
