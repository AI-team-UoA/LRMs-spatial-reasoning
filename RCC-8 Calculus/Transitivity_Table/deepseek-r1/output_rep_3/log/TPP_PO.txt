PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial interactions. Since x is a tangential proper part of y, it is entirely within y and shares a boundary point with y. The partial overlap between y and z means they share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other. Considering the position of x relative to the overlapping and non-overlapping regions of y and z:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z, and x does not touch the overlapping region.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the non-overlapping part of y but touches the boundary of the overlapping region (which is part of z), resulting in a boundary touch without shared interiors.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x spans both the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y, so x and z share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z, and the boundary point of x (shared with y) is also on the boundary of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the overlapping region, but the boundary point of x (shared with y) is in the interior of z, so x does not touch z's boundary.

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible because z cannot be a proper part of x (as x is part of y and z only partially overlaps y), and x and z are not coincident.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
