PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), which means x and y are spatially identical, and PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other and they are not equal), the relation between x and z must be the same as the relation between y and z due to the equality.

Since PO(y,z) holds and x is identical to y, PO(x,z) must also hold. No other RCC-8 relations are possible because EQ(x,y) implies that x and z interact in exactly the same way as y and z.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

### Answer:
PO(x,z)
