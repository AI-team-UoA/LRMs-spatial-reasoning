PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given conditions are EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are determined by the composition of EC with EC. The relations are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected.  
  Example: x and z are on opposite sides of y, not touching each other.  
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally.  
  Example: x, y, z meet at a common boundary point (e.g., a tripoint where three regions touch).  
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap.  
  Example: x and z extend beyond y and share an interior region away from y.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z.  
  Example: x is inside z and touches z's boundary, while both touch y at the same boundary point.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).  
  Example: z is inside x and touches x's boundary, while both touch y at the same boundary point.  
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident.  
  Example: x and z are the same region, both externally connected to y (EC(x,y) and EC(y,x) are symmetric and consistent).  

The relations NTPP and NTPPi are not possible because they require one region to be a non-tangential proper part (not touching the boundary), which contradicts the external connection to y (since the interior of a non-tangential part cannot touch y).
