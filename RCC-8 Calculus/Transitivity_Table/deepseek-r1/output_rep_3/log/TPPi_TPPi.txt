PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which translate to TPP(y,x) and TPP(z,y) respectively, the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus.

- TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary).

Due to the transitivity of parthood, z must be a proper part of x. The specific relation between x and z depends on whether z touches x's boundary:
- If z touches the boundary of x (e.g., if the point where z touches y coincides with where y touches x), then TPP(z,x) holds, which corresponds to TPPi(x,z).
- If z does not touch the boundary of x (e.g., if z touches y at a point away from the boundary with x), then NTPP(z,x) holds, which corresponds to NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC, EC, and PO are excluded as x and z must share parts (through y).
- EQ is excluded because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so z cannot equal x.
- TPP and NTPP are inverses and imply z is part of x, not vice versa.
- The compositions TPP o TPP yield only TPP or NTPP for the direct parthood (here, for z relative to x).

Thus, the possible relations for R(x,z) are TPPi and NTPPi.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)
