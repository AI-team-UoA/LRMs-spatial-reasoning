PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), where EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical regions:

- PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap (share parts but neither is part of the other).
- Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), the relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y.
- Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z)
