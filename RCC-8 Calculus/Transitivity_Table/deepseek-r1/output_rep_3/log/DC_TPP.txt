PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the RCC-8 composition. Since x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)) and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), the following relations between x and z are possible:

- **DC(x,z)**: x is disconnected from z. This occurs if x is entirely outside z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x is externally connected to z. This is possible if x touches z's boundary at a point not shared with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps z. This can happen if x overlaps with a part of z that does not include y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, without connecting to y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z without touching the boundary, and disconnected from y.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are the same, but DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) contradict this (y would be part of x, but DC(x,y) requires no shared parts).
- TPPi(x,z) (equivalent to TPP(z,x)) and NTPPi(x,z) (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) would imply z is part of x, leading to a similar contradiction as y (part of z) would be part of x, but DC(x,y) forbids any shared parts.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
