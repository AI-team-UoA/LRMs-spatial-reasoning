PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely inside x and does not touch its boundary). Also, DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no parts.  

The possible relations between x and z are:  
- **DC(x,z)**: z is entirely disconnected from x.  
- **EC(x,z)**: z touches x's boundary externally but shares no interior parts.  
- **PO(x,z)**: z partially overlaps with x (they share some parts but neither is a part of the other).  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary).  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is entirely inside x and does not touch its boundary).  

These are possible because y is strictly inside x (non-tangential), and z may be outside, touching the boundary, overlapping, or inside x (tangentially or non-tangentially) without conflicting with DC(y,z).  

Relations excluded:  
- EQ(x,z): Impossible because y is inside x but disconnected from z, so x and z cannot be equal.  
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z): Impossible because if x were a proper part of z, then y (inside x) would be part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).  

### Answer:  
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
