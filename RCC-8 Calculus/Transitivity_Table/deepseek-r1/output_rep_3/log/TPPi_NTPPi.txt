PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.  
Given NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary.  

- Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must be inside x (transitivity of parthood).  
- z does not touch y's boundary. Because y touches x's boundary, but z is entirely within y's interior (away from y's boundary), z cannot touch x's boundary.  
- Thus, z is a non-tangential proper part of x: NTPP(z,x).  
- Therefore, the relation between x and z is the inverse: NTPPi(x,z).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, TPPi are excluded because z is strictly inside x without touching the boundary.  
- NTPP is excluded as it would require z to be a non-tangential part of x from x's perspective, but NTPPi is the correct inverse.
