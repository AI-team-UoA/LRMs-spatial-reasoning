PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y)), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- **PO(x,y)**: x and y partially overlap. They share some interior parts, but each has parts not shared with the other.
- **NTPP(z,y)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Considering the interaction between x and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x and y overlap in a region of y that does not include z. Since z is entirely within y, but x may only overlap with parts of y away from z, they can be disconnected.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z share a boundary but no interior parts. For example, x might touch z externally within y's interior, without overlapping.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z share some interior parts but not all. Since x partially overlaps y, and z is inside y, they may partially overlap if x covers part of z but not all.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x). Possible if z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary (e.g., within the region where x and y overlap).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x). Possible if z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary (e.g., z is in the interior of x within the overlap of x and y).

Impossible relations:
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z cannot be coincident because x has parts outside y, while z is entirely within y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x cannot be a tangential proper part of z because x has parts outside y, and z is inside y, so x cannot be contained in z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z for the same reason.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
