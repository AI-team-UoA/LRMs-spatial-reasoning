PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and does not touch x's boundary). Also, NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary).

The possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition and properties:
- Since y is a common non-tangential proper part of both x and z, x and z must be connected (not DC or EC).
- The relations EQ, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, and NTPPi are all possible, as they allow y to be contained internally in both regions without violating the non-tangential condition.

The possible relations are:
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (equal).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (share some interior parts but neither is part of the other).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)).

These cover all cases where y can be a non-tangential proper part of both x and z.
