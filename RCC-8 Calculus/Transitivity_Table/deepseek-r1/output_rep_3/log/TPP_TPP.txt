PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPP and NTPP.

- TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, which occurs if the boundary contact point between x and y is also on the boundary of z.
- NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which occurs if the boundary contact point between x and y is not on the boundary of z.

Other relations are impossible:
- DC, EC, PO: Not possible because x is entirely contained within z due to the part-hierarchy (x part of y part of z).
- EQ: Not possible because x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, so x cannot equal z.
- TPPi, NTPPi: Not possible because they imply z is part of x, but x is part of z.

This is derived from the RCC-8 composition table, where TPP composed with TPP results in {TPP, NTPP}.
