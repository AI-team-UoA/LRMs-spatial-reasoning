PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z). 

- **DC(x,z)**: This occurs if x and y touch at a boundary point where z is not present. Since z is a tangential proper part of y, it touches y's boundary only at specific points. If x touches y at a boundary point not shared with z, x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
  
- **EC(x,z)**: This occurs if x and y touch at a boundary point that is also on z's boundary. Since z touches y's boundary at that point, and x touches the same point, x and z are externally connected, sharing a boundary point but no interior parts.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- PO(x,z) is impossible because x and y share no interior parts, and z is contained within y, so x and z cannot share interior parts.
- EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPP(x,z), NTPPi(x,z) are all impossible because x is external to y except at the boundary, and z is a proper part of y, so x and z cannot be equal, and neither can be a proper part of the other.

### Answer: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)
