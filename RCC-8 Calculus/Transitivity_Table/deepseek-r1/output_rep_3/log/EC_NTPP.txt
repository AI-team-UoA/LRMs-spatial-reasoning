PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap, meaning x and z share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, meaning x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part, meaning x is a proper part of z and does not touch the boundary of z.

These are the only possible relations because:
- EC(x,y) implies x and y share a boundary point but no interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z) implies y is entirely contained within the interior of z, with no boundary contact.
- The contact point between x and y is interior to z, so x must intersect the interior of z, ruling out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).
- y being a proper part of z and EC(x,y) prevent x from being equal to z (EQ(x,z)) or having z as a proper part (TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)).
