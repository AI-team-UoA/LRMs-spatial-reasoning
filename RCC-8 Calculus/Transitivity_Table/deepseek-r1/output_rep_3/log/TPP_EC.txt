PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).  

**Reasoning**:  
- TPP(x,y) implies x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y’s boundary).  
- EC(y,z) implies y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.  
- Since x is entirely within y and touches y’s boundary, and y touches z’s boundary:  
  - If x is located at the portion of y’s boundary that contacts z, then x and z touch externally → EC(x,z).  
  - If x is not at the contact boundary between y and z, then x and z are disconnected → DC(x,z).  
- Other relations (PO, EQ, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi) are impossible because x and z cannot share interior points (as y and z do not) and x cannot extend beyond y.  

### Answer:  
DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
