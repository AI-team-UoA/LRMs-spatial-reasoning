PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are disjoint within y (e.g., x near y's boundary, z in y's interior, no overlap).
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z touch externally but share no interior (e.g., x touches y's boundary, z touches x's inner boundary without overlapping).
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z partially overlap (e.g., x is a ring touching y's boundary, z overlaps part of the ring and the hole).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (e.g., z inside x and touching x's inner boundary, with x touching y's boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (e.g., z entirely inside x without touching any boundary of x, and x touching y's boundary).

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would require x inside z, but x touches y's boundary while z does not, leading to contradiction.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible since x touches y's boundary and z does not.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
