PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: This occurs if x is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z. Since NTPP(x,y) ensures x is strictly inside y and away from its boundary, and the non-overlapping part of y is disjoint from z, x and z share no common parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: This occurs if x is a disconnected region with parts in both the overlapping and non-overlapping regions of y with respect to z. Thus, x and z share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: This occurs if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches the boundary of z. Since x is inside z (as the overlap is part of z), and it touches z's boundary, it becomes a tangential proper part.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: This occurs if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z but does not touch the boundary of z. Thus, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Other relations are impossible:
- EQ(x,z) is excluded because x is a proper part of y (by NTPP), and PO(y,z) implies z is not equal to y or a part of it, so x cannot equal z.
- EC(x,z) is excluded because any contact would require boundary interaction, but if x is in the overlapping region, it shares interior with z (so not EC), and if not, it is DC (no contact).
- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are excluded because they would imply z is a proper part of x, but x is a proper part of y and z overlaps y partially, so z cannot be contained in x.

Thus, the possible relations are DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: DC, PO, TPP, NTPP
