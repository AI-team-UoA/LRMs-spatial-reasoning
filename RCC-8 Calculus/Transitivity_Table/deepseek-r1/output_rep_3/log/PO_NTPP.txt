PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

- **PO(x,z)**: This occurs when x is not entirely contained within z. Since part of x overlaps with y and y is inside z, x shares some interior points with z, but x extends outside z, resulting in partial overlap.
- **TPP(x,z)**: This occurs when x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z. Since x overlaps with y and y is inside z, x can be a tangential proper part of z if it contacts the boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: This occurs when x is entirely contained within z and does not touch the boundary of z. Since x overlaps with y and y is inside z, x can be a non-tangential proper part of z if it remains in the interior.

Relations such as DC(x,z), EC(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because:
- DC and EC require no common interior points, but the overlap between x and y (with y inside z) ensures x and z share interior points.
- EQ would imply x and z are identical, but PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) cannot both hold if x and z are equal.
- TPPi and NTPPi would imply z is part of x, but PO(x,y) requires that y is not a subset of x, contradicting NTPP(y,z) where y is part of z.

### Answer:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
