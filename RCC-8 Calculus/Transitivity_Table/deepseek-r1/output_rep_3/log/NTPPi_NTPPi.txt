PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), this implies:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary).
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary).

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. This is due to the transitivity of the NTPP relation in the RCC-8 calculus.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- DC(x,z) is impossible as z is within x.
- EC(x,z) is impossible as they share interior points.
- PO(x,z) is impossible as z is entirely within x.
- TPP(x,z) is impossible as z does not touch x's boundary (since y is non-tangential to x and z is within y).
- TPPi(x,z) is impossible as z is smaller than x and cannot contain x.
- NTPP(x,z) is impossible as it would mean x is part of z, but z is smaller.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible as z is a proper part of x.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
