PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relationships between x and z using the RCC-8 calculus.

- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. Thus, y is part of z, and y does not touch the boundary of z.

Considering the constraints:
- y is entirely within the interior of z (from NTPP(y,z)).
- y touches the boundary of x (from TPP(y,x)).
- Since y is inside z and not touching z's boundary, the boundary of x that y touches must be entirely within the interior of z. Therefore, x must be entirely contained within the interior of z (non-tangentially).

This implies that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, leading to the relation NTPP(x,z).

Other relations are not possible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Would require x and z to be the same, but TPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z) imply y is tangential to x but not to z, a contradiction.
- **TPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: Would require x to be tangential to z or z to be tangential/non-tangential to x, but this conflicts with y touching the boundary of x while being interior to z.
- **PO(x,z)**, **EC(x,z)**, **DC(x,z)**: These would imply x and z share only boundaries or are disconnected, but y is a common part, so they must overlap internally.

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
