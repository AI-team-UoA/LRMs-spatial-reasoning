PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (i.e., identical in spatial extent).
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z (i.e., y is completely contained within z and does not touch its boundary).

Since EQ(x,y) implies that x and y are the same region, the relationship NTPP(y,z) directly applies to x as well. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) must hold, meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

This is the only possible relation because:
- The equality EQ(x,y) means that any relation involving y also involves x identically.
- NTPP is specific: x cannot be equal to z (as it is a proper part), cannot touch the boundary (ruling out TPP), and cannot have any other relation (e.g., DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi) due to the containment and non-tangential nature.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
