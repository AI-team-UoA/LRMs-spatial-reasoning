PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi. This is because:
- DC(x,z) is possible if x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z) is possible if x and z touch externally but do not overlap.
- PO(x,z) is possible if x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,x)) is possible if z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) is possible if z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The relations EQ, TPP, and NTPP are impossible due to contradictions with the given constraints. For example:
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are identical, contradicting EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) as EC and DC cannot hold simultaneously for the same pairs.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is part of z, but EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) cannot hold simultaneously as y would be connected to z through x.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
