PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the relations in the RCC-8 calculus. TPPi(x,y) implies that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y ⊆ x and y touches the boundary of x). TPP(y,z) implies that y is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., y ⊆ z and y touches the boundary of z). Since y is a common part of both x and z, and it touches the boundaries, the following relations between x and z are possible:

- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (i.e., x = z). This is possible if x and z are the same region.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (i.e., they share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other). This occurs when x and z overlap but neither contains the other entirely.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., x ⊆ z and x touches the boundary of z). This is possible when x is contained within z and shares a boundary point with z, facilitated by y touching both boundaries.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., z ⊆ x and z touches the boundary of x). This is equivalent to TPP(z,x) and occurs when z is contained within x and shares a boundary point with x.

The relations DC, EC, NTPP, and NTPPi are not possible because:
- DC and EC require no shared interior points, but y is a shared interior part of both x and z.
- NTPP and NTPPi require no boundary contact, but the tangential conditions from TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) imply that x and z must share boundary contact through y if one contains the other.

Thus, the possible relations are EQ, PO, TPP, and TPPi.

### Answer: EQ(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z)
