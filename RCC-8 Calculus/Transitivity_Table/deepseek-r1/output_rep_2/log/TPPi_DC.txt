PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x and touches the boundary of x. Also given DC(y,z), meaning y and z are disconnected and share no parts.  

The possible relations between x and z are:  
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. Since y is inside x and disconnected from z, z could be entirely outside x.  
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. z could touch the boundary of x without overlapping interiors, and y (inside x) remains disconnected from z.  
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. z could partially overlap x in a region not containing y, satisfying DC(y,z).  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. z is inside x, touching its boundary, and disconnected from y.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary, and disconnected from y.  

The relations EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are impossible:  
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are the same, but then y (part of x) cannot be disconnected from z.  
- TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, implying y is part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).  
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, also implying y is part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).  

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.  

### Answer:  
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
