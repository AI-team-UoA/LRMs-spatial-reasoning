PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be EC(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region, so the spatial relationship between x and y directly applies to x and z. EC(x,y) indicates that x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts, and since z is identical to y, x and z must also be externally connected without sharing interior parts. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as alternatives would contradict the given relations (e.g., DC would imply no connection, but EC requires touching; PO would imply interior overlap, but EC excludes it; etc.).
