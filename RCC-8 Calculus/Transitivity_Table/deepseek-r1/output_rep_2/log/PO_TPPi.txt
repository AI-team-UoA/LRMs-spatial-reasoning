PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being a proper part of the other. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, so z is entirely within y and touches y's boundary.

The composition of PO and TPPi allows for the following relations between x and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, with no shared parts. This occurs if x overlaps y in a region disjoint from z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, touching only at a boundary but sharing no interior parts. This is possible if x touches z at a boundary point without overlapping interiors.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being a proper part of the other. This occurs if the overlap between x and y includes part of z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning x contains z entirely and z touches x's boundary. This is possible if x covers z completely and z is tangential to x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning x contains z entirely and z does not touch x's boundary. This is possible if x covers z completely and z is not tangential to x.

Relations such as TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible because:
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, but since z is a proper part of y and x is not a subset of y (due to PO(x,y)), x cannot be part of z.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible as x and z cannot be coincident given the partial overlap with y and z being a proper part of y.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
