PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x.  
Given EQ(y,z), which means y and z are identical regions.  
Therefore, z is also a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x).  
This implies that the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), as NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because EQ(y,z) ensures that z has the same spatial relationship with x as y does.
