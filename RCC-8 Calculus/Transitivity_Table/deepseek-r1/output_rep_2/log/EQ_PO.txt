PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) holds, x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same spatial region. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is identical to the relationship between y and z. Since PO(y,z) holds, y and z partially overlap: they share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other, and they are not coincident. Thus, the relationship between x and z must also be PO.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
