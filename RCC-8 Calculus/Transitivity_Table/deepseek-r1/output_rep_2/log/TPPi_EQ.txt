PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Also, EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions). Since z is identical to y, and y is a tangential proper part of x, it follows that z must also be a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is the same as that between x and y, which is TPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
