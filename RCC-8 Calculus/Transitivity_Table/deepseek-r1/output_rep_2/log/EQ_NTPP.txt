PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same spatial region. Given NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely contained within z and does not touch its boundary. Since x and y are identical, x must also be entirely contained within z without touching its boundary. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because y is a proper part of z (so x cannot equal z).
- TPP(x,z) is impossible because NTPP specifies no boundary touching, and x being identical to y inherits this property.
- PO, EC, DC, TPPi, or NTPPi are inconsistent with x being entirely within z and not touching the boundary.

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
