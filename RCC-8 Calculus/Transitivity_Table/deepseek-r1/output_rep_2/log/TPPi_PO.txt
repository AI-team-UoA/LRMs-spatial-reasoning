PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary). Also given PO(y,z), which means that y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other).

The possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and spatial reasoning:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is possible when z extends partially outside x, sharing some interior parts with x but neither being part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible when z is entirely within x, touches x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible when z is entirely within x, does not touch x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y.

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because y is part of x and overlaps z, so x and z must share parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected is impossible because PO(y,z) implies interior sharing between y and z, and since y is part of x, x and z share interior parts.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part of z is impossible because if x were part of z, then y (as part of x) would be part of z, contradicting PO(y,z).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part of z is impossible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal is impossible because y is a proper part of x, so if x equaled z, y would be part of z, contradicting PO(y,z).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
