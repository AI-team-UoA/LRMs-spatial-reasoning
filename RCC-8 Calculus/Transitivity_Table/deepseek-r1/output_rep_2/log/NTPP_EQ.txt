PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x,y) holds, meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary). Also, EQ(y,z) holds, meaning y and z are coincident (they are the same spatial region).  

Since y and z are identical, the relationship between x and y directly applies to x and z. Thus, x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
