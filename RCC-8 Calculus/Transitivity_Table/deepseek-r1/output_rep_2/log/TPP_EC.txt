PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, meaning they share no common points. This occurs if the boundary contact point between y and z does not involve the region where x is located.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This occurs if x is positioned at the boundary of y where y contacts z, allowing x to touch z directly.

These are the only possible relations, as x is entirely within y (due to TPP), and y only contacts z externally (due to EC), preventing any interior overlap or other relations like PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ between x and z.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
