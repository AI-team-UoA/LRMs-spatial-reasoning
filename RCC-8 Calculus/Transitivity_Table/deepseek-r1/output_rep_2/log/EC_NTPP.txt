PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap occurs when x and z share some interior parts, but neither is entirely contained within the other. This is possible because x touches y (which is inside z) at a boundary point in z's interior, allowing x to extend both inside and outside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part occurs when x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary at some point. The contact with y (inside z) does not prevent x from also touching z's boundary elsewhere.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part occurs when x is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary. The contact point with y is in z's interior, so x can be fully inside without boundary contact.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**, **EC(x,z)**: Disconnected or externally connected require no interior overlap, but x must share interior points with z due to the contact with y in z's interior.
- **EQ(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equality or z being a proper part of x is impossible because y is inside z and x only touches y externally, so x cannot contain z.
- **PO** covers partial overlap without containment, while **TPP** and **NTPP** cover cases where x is entirely within z.
