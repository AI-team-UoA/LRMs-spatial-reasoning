PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).  
- **TPP(x,z)**: This occurs if x touches the boundary of z.  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: This occurs if x is entirely inside z without touching its boundary.  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as x must be a proper part of z (ruling out DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPPi, NTPPi).  

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
