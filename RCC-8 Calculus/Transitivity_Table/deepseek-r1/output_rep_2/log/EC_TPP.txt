PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined as follows:

- EC(x,y) indicates that x and y are externally connected, sharing a boundary point but no interior points.
- TPP(y,z) indicates that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is contained within z and shares a boundary point with z.

The point of contact between x and y (from EC) is also part of the closure of z (since y ⊆ z). This point may lie on the boundary or interior of z, leading to different scenarios:

1. **EC(x,z)**: If the contact point is on the boundary of z and x does not extend into the interior of z, then x and z share only a boundary point with disjoint interiors.
2. **PO(x,z)**: If x extends into the interior of z (partially overlapping), sharing some interior points but neither fully containing the other.
3. **TPP(x,z)**: If x is entirely contained within z and shares a boundary point with z (e.g., x touches z's boundary at a point distinct from the contact with y).
4. **NTPP(x,z)**: If x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary at any point.

DC is impossible because the contact point between x and y ensures x and z share a common point (in the closure). TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible as they would require z to be a proper part of x or equal, which contradicts TPP(y,z) (y ⊆ z and y ≠ z, so z cannot be part of x or equal).

Thus, the possible relations are EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
