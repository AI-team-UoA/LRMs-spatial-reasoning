PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the relationship between x and z is determined as follows:  
- NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely contained within the interior of y, without touching y's boundary.  
- NTPP(y,z) means y is entirely contained within the interior of z, without touching z's boundary.  
Thus, x must be entirely contained within the interior of z, without touching z's boundary. This corresponds to NTPP(x,z).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ cannot hold, as they would contradict the given conditions (e.g., x cannot be disconnected from z or touch its boundary).  

Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).
