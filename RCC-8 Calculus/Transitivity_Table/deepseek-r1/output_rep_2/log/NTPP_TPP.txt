PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary).
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary).

Analysis:
- Since x is entirely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), and y is entirely inside z (TPP(y,z)), x must be entirely inside z. Thus, x is a proper part of z, ruling out DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi.
- NTPP(x,y) implies x does not touch y's boundary. TPP(y,z) implies y touches z's boundary. However, because x is strictly interior to y (away from y's boundary), and y's contact with z's boundary occurs only at y's boundary (which x avoids), x does not touch z's boundary. Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Conclusion:
- The only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).
