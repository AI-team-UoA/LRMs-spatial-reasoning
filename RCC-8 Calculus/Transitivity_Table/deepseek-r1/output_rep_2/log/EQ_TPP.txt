PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are identical spatial regions. Given TPP(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z, touches z's boundary, and is not equal to z.

Since x and y are identical, x must also be a tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
