PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined through composition in the RCC-8 calculus.

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. This implies z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.

Since z is part of y and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely within the interior of x. Specifically:
- Because y does not touch the boundary of x, the boundary of y is also contained within the interior of x.
- Therefore, z, touching the boundary of y, remains strictly within the interior of x and cannot touch the boundary of x.
- This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x) holds.

The relation NTPP(z,x) corresponds to NTPPi(x,z) for the pair (x,z). Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so z â‰  x.
- TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z) are impossible because z cannot touch the boundary of x due to y being non-tangential.
- PO(x,z), EC(x,z), or DC(x,z) are impossible because z is entirely contained within x.

Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).
