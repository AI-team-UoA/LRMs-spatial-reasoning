PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are the same spatial region. Thus, any relation involving y can be directly applied to x. Since EC(y,z) holds (y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts), substituting x for y gives EC(x,z). Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)
