PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations allowed by the RCC-8 relations. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary). PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap (they share some interior parts but neither is part of the other).

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected if x is entirely within the part of y not overlapping with z and does not touch the boundary of z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected if x is entirely within the part of y not overlapping with z but touches the boundary of z at some point.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap if x spans the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y and z (i.e., part of x is in z and part is not).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches the boundary of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z but does not touch the boundary of z.

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because z cannot be part of x (since x is a proper part of y and y is not contained in z), and x and z cannot be equal (since x is part of y and y and z are not coincident).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
