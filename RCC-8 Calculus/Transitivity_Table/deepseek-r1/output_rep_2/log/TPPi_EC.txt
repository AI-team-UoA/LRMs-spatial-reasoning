PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).  
- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x, touches x's boundary, and y ≠ x.  
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.  

Possible relations between x and z:  
1. **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior. This is possible if z is outside x and touches at the boundary point where y is located.  
2. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior but neither is part of the other. This is possible if z extends into x's interior beyond the contact point with y, without violating EC(y,z).  
3. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, while EC(y,z) holds at the contact point.  
4. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is entirely inside x (not touching the boundary) and touches y in x's interior.  

Other relations are impossible:  
- **DC(x,z)**: Cannot hold because y (part of x) touches z, so x and z must be connected.  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Cannot hold because y is a proper part of x, and EC(y,z) implies z ≠ y, so x ≠ z.  
- **TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)**: Cannot hold because if x is part of z, then y (part of x) is part of z, but EC(y,z) requires no interior sharing, which is contradicted if y is inside z.  
- **EC(z,x)**: Same as EC(x,z), already included.  
- **PO(z,x)**: Same as PO(x,z), already included.  

Thus, the possible relations are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).  

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
