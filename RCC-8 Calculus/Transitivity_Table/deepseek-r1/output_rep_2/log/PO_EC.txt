PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The composition table for PO and EC yields the following possible relations for (x, z):

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This is possible if x and z are entirely disjoint, with no shared points.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This occurs if x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. This happens if x and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of tangential proper part, meaning TPP(z,x). This implies z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of non-tangential proper part, meaning NTPP(z,x). This implies z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary).

The relations **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, and **EQ(x,z)** are not possible. TPP or NTPP would require x to be a proper part of z, but this conflicts with EC(y,z) and PO(x,y), as z cannot contain parts of y's interior. EQ is impossible because x and z cannot be coincident given the partial overlap of x with y and the external connection of y with z.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
