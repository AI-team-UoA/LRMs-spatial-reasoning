PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given conditions are NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).  
- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch its boundary.  
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. Thus, y is entirely contained within the interior of z and does not touch its boundary.  

The possible relationships between x and z must account for the shared region y in the interior of both. The constraints rule out DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected) because they imply no shared interior, but y is in the interior of both x and z.  

The possible relations are:  
1. **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z are the same region, with y strictly inside both.  
2. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This occurs when neither is a proper part of the other, but they share an interior region (including y).  
3. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. x is entirely within z but touches its boundary, while y is strictly inside x (and thus z).  
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. z is entirely within x but touches its boundary, while y is strictly inside z (and thus x).  
5. **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x is entirely within the interior of z, not touching its boundary, with y strictly inside x.  
6. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely within the interior of x, not touching its boundary, with y strictly inside z.  

These cover all cases where y remains in the interior of both regions without violating the initial conditions.
