PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z must be analyzed.

- NTPP(x,y) indicates that x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- DC(y,z) indicates that y and z are completely disconnected and share no points.

Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, every point of x is also a point of y. Because y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), they share no points. Therefore, x and z cannot share any points, as any shared point would imply that y and z share that point (contradicting DC(y,z)). Consequently, x and z must be disconnected.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).
