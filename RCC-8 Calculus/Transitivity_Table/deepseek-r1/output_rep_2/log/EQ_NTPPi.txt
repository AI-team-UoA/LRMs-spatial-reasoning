PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we can deduce the relationship between x and z as follows:  
- EQ(x,y) implies x and y are identical (same region).  
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary).  

Since x and y are identical, substituting y with x in NTPP(z,y) gives NTPP(z,x).  
- NTPP(z,x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).  

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).  

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
