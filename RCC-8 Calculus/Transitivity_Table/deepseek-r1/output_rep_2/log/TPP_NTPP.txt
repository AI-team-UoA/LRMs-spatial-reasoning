PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.
- Since x is part of y and y is part of z, x must be part of z. Moreover, because y is entirely contained within z without touching its boundary, and x is part of y, x cannot touch z's boundary. Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, leading to NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi are inconsistent with the transitive part-hood.
- TPP(x,z) would require x to touch z's boundary, but this is impossible since y (containing x) does not touch z's boundary.

### Answer:
NTPP(x,z)
