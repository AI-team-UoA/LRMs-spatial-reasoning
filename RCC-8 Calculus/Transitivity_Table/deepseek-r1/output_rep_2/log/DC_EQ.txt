PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z):
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected (no shared parts).
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical (coincident regions).

Since y and z are identical, the spatial relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Therefore, x and z must also be disconnected, as any connection between x and z would imply a connection between x and y (contradicting DC(x,y)). 

The only possible relation is DC(x,z). Other RCC-8 relations (EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are incompatible with DC(x,y) when y and z are identical.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
