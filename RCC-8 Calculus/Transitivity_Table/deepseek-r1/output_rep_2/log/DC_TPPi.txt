PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which implies that z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is part of y and touches y's boundary).
- Since z is entirely within y and x is disconnected from y (sharing no parts with y), x must also be disconnected from z, sharing no parts with z.
- No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
  - EC(x,z) would require touching at a boundary, but this would imply contact between x and y, contradicting DC(x,y).
  - PO(x,z) would imply partial overlap, but this would mean x overlaps y, contradicting DC(x,y).
  - TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z) would all imply that x and z share parts or are coincident, leading to overlap with y, which contradicts DC(x,y).

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
