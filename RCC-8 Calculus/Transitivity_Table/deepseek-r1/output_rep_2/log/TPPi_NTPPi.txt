PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z):

- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y. Thus, z is part of y but does not touch the boundary of y.

Since z is strictly contained in the interior of y and y is contained in x while touching the boundary of x, z must be entirely within the interior of x and not touch its boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

This is the only possible relation, as other relations like DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi (in this context), or EQ are inconsistent with the given conditions.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
