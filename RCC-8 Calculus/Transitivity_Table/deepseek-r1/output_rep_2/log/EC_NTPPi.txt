PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relationship between x and z is DC (disconnected).

- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- NTPP(z,y) means z is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Since z is strictly inside y (away from the boundary), and x only contacts y at the boundary without overlapping interiors, x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, they are disconnected (DC).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- EC(x,z) is excluded because z does not touch y's boundary, so x cannot touch z.
- PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, NTPPi, and EQ are excluded as they require spatial overlap or parthood, which is absent.
- Thus, DC is the only possible relation.
