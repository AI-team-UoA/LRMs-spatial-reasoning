PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:

- TPP(x,y) implies that x is a proper part of y, sharing some boundary points with y (x is inside y and they touch at the boundary).
- DC(y,z) implies that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts (no interior or boundary points in common).

Since x is entirely contained within y (as a proper part), and y shares no parts with z, x cannot share any parts with z. Specifically:
- x and z cannot share interior parts (as y and z do not).
- x and z cannot share boundary points because the boundary of x that touches y is within y, and y has no boundary contact with z.

Thus, x and z must be disconnected (DC). No other RCC-8 relation is possible:
- EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ would require some spatial overlap or boundary contact, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Therefore, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
