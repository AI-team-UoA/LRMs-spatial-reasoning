PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y, touches y's boundary, and x ≠ y).
- TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y, touches y's boundary, and z ≠ y).

Both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, meaning they are contained within y and touch its boundary. The possible relationships between x and z are:

1. **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. x and z may be separate and non-overlapping (e.g., two distinct regions inside y that do not touch).
2. **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. x and z may touch at a boundary but share no interior (e.g., adjacent regions within y).
3. **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping. x and z may overlap in some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other (e.g., overlapping regions within y).
4. **EQ(x,z)**: Equal. x and z may be the same region (since both are tangential proper parts of y, and nothing prevents them from being identical).

Other relations are impossible:
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, or **NTPPi(x,z)** would imply that one is a proper part of the other. However, if x were a proper part of z (and z is part of y), then x would be entirely within z, which is within y. But x must touch y's boundary, which would be violated if x is interior to z (since z's boundary is inside y, not at y's boundary). The same logic applies if z were a proper part of x. Thus, part-hood relations are excluded.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, and EQ.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), EQ(x,z)
