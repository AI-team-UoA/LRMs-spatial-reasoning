PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z must be consistent with the properties of these relations.

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is part of y, x touches y's boundary, and x ≠ y.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), substituting z for y in TPP(x,y) directly yields TPP(x,z). This is because:
- x is part of z (as z = y).
- x touches z's boundary (as the boundary is unchanged).
- x ≠ z (since TPP(x,y) implies x ≠ y, and z = y).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- **DC, EC, PO**: Excluded because x is part of z and shares interior parts.
- **NTPP**: Excluded because TPP(x,y) requires x to touch y's boundary, and z = y, so x must touch z's boundary (NTPP would require no boundary touching).
- **TPPi, NTPPi**: Excluded because these would imply z is part of x, contradicting TPP(x,y) (which implies x is part of z and x ≠ z).
- **EQ**: Excluded because TPP(x,y) implies x ≠ y, and z = y, so x ≠ z.

Thus, the only possible relation is TPP(x,z).
