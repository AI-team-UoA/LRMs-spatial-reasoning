PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The RCC-8 composition table allows for the following possibilities:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This occurs if z is positioned such that it has no spatial interaction with x, for example, if z is far from both x and y.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This is possible if z touches x at a boundary not shared with y, and since DC(y,z) ensures no interaction between y and z.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other. This can happen if z overlaps with x in a region not involving y, and DC(y,z) holds as y does not interact with z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is part of x and touches x's boundary). This is possible if z is part of x and y touches x at a different boundary, ensuring DC(y,z).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary). This can occur if z is entirely contained within x and not near the boundary where y touches x, satisfying DC(y,z).

The following relations are not possible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equality is impossible because if x and z were the same, EC(x,y) would imply EC(z,y), contradicting DC(y,z).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x cannot be a tangential proper part of z because if x were part of z, EC(x,y) would imply that y touches z (since any point shared with x is part of z), contradicting DC(y,z).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Similarly, x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z for the same reason; y touching x would imply y touches z, violating DC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
