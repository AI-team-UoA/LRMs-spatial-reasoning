{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), this means that x and y are spatially coincident (identical), and y and z are spatially coincident. By the transitivity of the EQ relation in the RCC-8 calculus, x and z must also be spatially coincident. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 49.33623242378235, "reasoning-tokens": 984, "completion-tokens": 1067}
