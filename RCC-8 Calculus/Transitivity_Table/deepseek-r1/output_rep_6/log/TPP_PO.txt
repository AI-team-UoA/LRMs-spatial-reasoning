PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely within y and touches y's boundary. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a part of the other. The possible relations for x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This occurs if x is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z, so x and z share no common parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This occurs if x is positioned at the boundary of y where y and z meet, such that x and z touch at a boundary point but have no common interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. This occurs if x spans the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y and z, so x and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part. This occurs if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part. This occurs if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and does not touch z's boundary.

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible because x cannot be equal to or contain z (since x is a proper part of y, and y is not contained in z or equal to z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
