PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):  
- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x.  
- TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y.  

Thus, z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. Therefore, z must be a proper part of x, so the relation between x and z must be either TPP or NTPP in the direction from z to x.  

Expressed as relations from x to z:  
- If z is a tangential proper part of x, this is TPPi(x,z).  
- If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, this is NTPPi(x,z).  

Both are possible:  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Occurs if z touches the boundary of x (e.g., if the tangency point of z to y coincides with the tangency point of y to x).  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Occurs if z does not touch the boundary of x (e.g., if z is entirely interior within y, and y’s tangency to x is disjoint from z’s tangency to y).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as z must be a proper part of x, ruling out DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPP, and NTPP for (x,z).
