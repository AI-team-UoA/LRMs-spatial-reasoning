PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:

- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. Thus, y is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.

Considering the spatial constraints:
- y is inside both x and z.
- y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.
- x and z must share at least the region of y.

Possible relations between x and z:
1. **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. x and z share interior parts (including y), but neither is a part of the other. This is possible because y touches z's boundary at a point interior to x, and both regions can extend beyond each other.
2. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x). z is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent as y touches z's boundary (which is interior to x) without violating y's non-tangential relation to x.
3. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x). z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, z is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary. This is consistent as y touches z's boundary (interior to x) without affecting x's boundary.

Other relations are impossible:
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z): Cannot hold because x and z share the region y.
- EQ(x,z): Would imply y touches x's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,x).
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z): Would require y to be away from z's boundary, contradicting TPP(y,z).
- PO, TPPi, and NTPPi are the only consistent relations.

Thus, the possible relationships are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
