PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident (the same region). Given TPP(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary. Since x and y are identical, the relation between x and z is the same as that between y and z. Thus, x is also a tangential proper part of z. Therefore, the only possible relation is TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
