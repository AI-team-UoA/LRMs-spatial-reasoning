PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical, so the relation between x and y directly applies to x and z. PO(x,y) indicates partial overlap, which must hold for x and z as well. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as PO is the only consistent relation under these conditions.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
