PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- TPPi(y,z): equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y, touches y's boundary, and z â‰  y).

Analysis:
- Since z is a tangential proper part of y, z is entirely within y and touches y's boundary.
- DC(x,y) implies x and y share no points (no spatial overlap).
- Because z is contained within y, any point of z is also a point of y. If x shared any point with z, that point would also be in y, contradicting DC(x,y). Thus, x and z cannot share any points.
- Therefore, x and z must be disconnected (DC(x,z)).

Verification against RCC-8 relations:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible, as z is part of y and x is disconnected from y.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap would imply shared points, contradicting DC(x,y).
- **EC(x,z)**: External contact requires a shared boundary point, which would be part of y, contradicting DC(x,y).
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: Any part relation (or inverse) would imply spatial inclusion, but x is entirely outside y (and hence outside z).
- **DC(x,z)**: Consistent, as no points are shared.

Conclusion: The only possible relation is DC(x,z).
