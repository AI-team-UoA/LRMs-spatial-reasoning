PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary). Also given NTPP(y,z), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary).

The possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:
- Since y is part of both x and z, x and z must share some spatial region, ruling out DC (disconnected) and EC (externally connected).
- x and z cannot be equal (EQ) because y cannot be both tangential to x and non-tangential to z if x and z are the same region.
- z cannot be a proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x), or equivalently TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)) because if z were part of x, y (being strictly inside z and not touching z's boundary) could not touch x's boundary, contradicting TPP(y,x).
- The possible relations are:
  - **PO(x,z)**: Partially Overlaps. x and z share some but not all parts, and neither is part of the other. This is possible if x and z overlap such that y is on the boundary of x and interior to z.
  - **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential Proper Part. x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary). This is possible if y is on the boundary of x but not on the boundary of z, and x touches z's boundary at a different point.
  - **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-Tangential Proper Part. x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary). This is possible if x is entirely contained within z without touching its boundary, and y is on the boundary of x but interior to z.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.
