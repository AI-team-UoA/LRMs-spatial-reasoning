PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x.  
Given NTPP(y,z), so y is a non-tangential proper part of z.  

The possible relations between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. Specifically:  
- If x and z are equal, EQ(x,z) is possible.  
- If x and z partially overlap but neither is a part of the other, PO(x,z) is possible.  
- If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, NTPP(x,z) is possible.  
- If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, NTPPi(x,z) (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) is possible.  
- If x is a tangential proper part of z, TPP(x,z) is possible.  
- If z is a tangential proper part of x, TPPi(x,z) (equivalent to TPP(z,x)) is possible.  

The relations DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are impossible because x and z must share the common part y in their interiors, so they cannot be disconnected or only externally connected.  

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are EQ, PO, NTPP, NTPPi, TPP, and TPPi.

### Answer:  
EQ, PO, NTPP, NTPPi, TPP, TPPi
