PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 calculus as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This occurs if x is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z. Since x is non-tangential proper part of y and not in the overlapping region with z, x and z share no parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. This occurs if x is partially within the overlapping region of y and z and partially outside it. Since x is connected and inside y, it shares some parts with z but not all, and neither is part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part. This occurs if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches the boundary of z. Since x is part of z and touches its boundary, but not necessarily tangential to y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part. This occurs if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and does not touch the boundary of z. Since x is part of z and strictly inside it.

The relations EC(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible because:
- EC(x,z) requires touching without sharing interior, but given the overlap and x inside y, this cannot occur without sharing interior or being disconnected.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible as x is a proper part of y and y is not coincident with z.
- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is part of x, but x is a proper part of y, and z extends beyond y due to PO(y,z), making this impossible.

Thus, the only possible relations are DC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
