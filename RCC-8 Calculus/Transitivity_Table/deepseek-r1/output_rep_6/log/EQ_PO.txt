PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), which means that x and y are identical spatial regions, any relation that holds between y and z also holds between x and z. Since PO(y,z) is given, meaning y and z partially overlap (they share a spatial part but neither is part of the other), the relation between x and z must be identical. Therefore, the only possible relationship is PO(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because the identity (EQ) implies that x and z have the same spatial relationship as y and z.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
