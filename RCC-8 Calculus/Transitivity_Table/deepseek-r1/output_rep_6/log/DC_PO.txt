PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. DC(x,y) indicates that x and y share no common points, while PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither being part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary but share no interior points).
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary).

These possibilities arise because x, being disconnected from y, can interact with the parts of z that do not overlap with y. Relations such as EQ, TPPi, NTPPi are impossible due to the constraints from DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
