PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we need to find the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and shares a boundary point with x).
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and shares a boundary point with z).

The possible relations between x and z are derived from the composition of these relations and spatial reasoning:

- **DC(x,z)**: Not possible, because y is part of both x and z, so x and z share common parts (interior of y), violating disconnection.
- **EC(x,z)**: Not possible, for the same reason as DC; y's interior is shared, so x and z cannot be externally connected with no common interior.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible. x and z partially overlap, sharing y but neither is a part of the other. For example, x and z could both contain y and extend beyond each other, with y touching the boundaries of both x and z at different points.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Possible. x and z are the same region, and y is a tangential proper part of both.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible. x is a tangential proper part of z. For instance, y is inside x, x is inside z, and all share boundary points appropriately (e.g., y touches the boundary where x touches z).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Not possible. If x were a non-tangential proper part of z (inside z without touching boundary), then y (inside x) could not touch z's boundary, contradicting TPP(y,z).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Possible. This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. Similar to TPP(x,z), with z inside x and boundary sharing.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Not possible. Equivalent to NTPP(z,x). If z were a non-tangential proper part of x (inside x without touching boundary), then y (inside z) could not touch x's boundary, contradicting TPP(y,x) from TPPi(x,y).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z)
