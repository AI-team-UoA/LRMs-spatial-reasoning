PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) (which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x)) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap occurs because z overlaps with y (which is entirely within x), but z may extend outside x, leading to shared parts without one being part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Here, z must be entirely within x (due to the overlap with y inside x) and touches the boundary of x, while still partially overlapping y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely within x without touching its boundary, and overlaps y as required.

Other relations are impossible:
- DC or EC: Cannot occur because z overlaps y, which is inside x, so x and z must share interior points.
- EQ: Contradicts PO(y,z) and NTPP(y,x), as equality would imply y is part of z, conflicting with partial overlap.
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z): Would mean x is a proper part of z, but then y (inside x) would be entirely within z, contradicting PO(y,z) which requires parts of z outside y.
- PO(y,z) ensures neither y nor z is part of the other, and NTPP(y,x) ensures y is strictly inside x without boundary contact.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
