PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial configurations allowed in the RCC-8 calculus. After analyzing the constraints:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are entirely disjoint. Example: x and y touch at a boundary, z partially overlaps y, and x is placed away from z.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior. Example: x touches y, z partially overlaps y, and x is arranged to touch z at a boundary without sharing interior.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x and z share some interior parts but neither is part of the other. Example: z partially overlaps y, and x is placed to overlap with the part of z outside y while touching y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z (touching z's boundary). Example: z contains part of y; x is inside z and touches both y and z's boundary at the same point.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z (entirely inside without touching z's boundary). Example: z contains part of y; x is entirely inside z and touches y at a point interior to z, avoiding z's boundary.

The relationships TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:
- TPPi/NTPPi would require z to be a proper part of x, but this conflicts with PO(y,z) and EC(x,y) (as y cannot share interior with z while being externally connected to x).
- EQ would require x and z to be identical, but EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are inconsistent with equality.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
