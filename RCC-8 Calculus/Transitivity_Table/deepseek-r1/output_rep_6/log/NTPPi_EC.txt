PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. 

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is completely contained within the interior of x and does not touch its boundary).
- EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected (i.e., they share a boundary point but no interior points).

Considering the spatial constraints:
- Since y is entirely within the interior of x and touches z at a boundary point, this point of contact is also within the interior of x.
- Therefore, z must share at least this point with x, which is interior to x, ruling out disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC) relations between x and z, as these require no shared interior points.
- Equality (EQ) is impossible as x and z are distinct regions.
- Partial overlap (PO) is possible, where x and z share some interior points but neither is a part of the other.
- Tangential proper part inverse (TPPi) is possible, meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is part of x and touches the boundary of x).
- Non-tangential proper part inverse (NTPPi) is possible, meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is completely contained within the interior of x and does not touch its boundary).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
