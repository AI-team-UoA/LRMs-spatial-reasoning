PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), which means x and y are coincident (spatially identical), and NTPP(y,z), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely contained within z, does not touch z's boundary, and is not equal to z), the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z). This is because the equality EQ(x,y) implies that x inherits all spatial relationships of y. Therefore, since y is NTPP of z, x must also be NTPP of z. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as all others conflict with the given conditions.
