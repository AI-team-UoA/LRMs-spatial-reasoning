PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither being a proper part of the other. EC(y,z) indicates that y and z are externally connected, touching at a boundary but sharing no interior points.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, with no shared points. This occurs when the part of x outside y does not intersect or touch z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, touching at a boundary but sharing no interior points. This occurs when x and z share a boundary point, often at the location where y and z connect.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither being a proper part of the other. This occurs when the part of x outside y overlaps with z in their exteriors.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs when z is a proper part of x and they share a boundary point, and x partially overlaps y while containing z.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs when z is a proper part of x with no boundary contact, and x partially overlaps y while containing z.

Relations such as TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), EQ(x,z), and PO(x,z) with x as part of z are impossible due to the constraint that EC(y,z) prevents z from sharing interior points with y, which would be violated if x (sharing interior with y) were part of z or if x and z overlapped in a way that forced interior sharing with y.
