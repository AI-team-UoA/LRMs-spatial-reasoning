PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch its boundary. Additionally, DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

The possible relationships between x and z must satisfy the conditions that y is inside x and disconnected from z. The following RCC-8 relations between x and z are possible:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is completely outside x, ensuring no overlap with y.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This is possible if z touches the boundary of x but does not overlap with the interior where y is located.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other. This is possible if z overlaps with x in a region that does not intersect with y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, z is entirely within x but touches its boundary. This is possible if z is inside x and disconnected from y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, z is entirely within x and does not touch its boundary. This is possible if z is inside x and disconnected from y.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply that x is a proper part of z, meaning y (as part of x) would share parts with z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are identical, so y (part of x) would share parts with z, again contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
