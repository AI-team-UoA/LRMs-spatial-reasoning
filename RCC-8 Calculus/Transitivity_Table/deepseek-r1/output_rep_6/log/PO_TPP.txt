PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap occurs because x shares a part with y (which is inside z), but x may extend outside z or have parts not fully contained in z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. Since y is inside z and touches its boundary, x (which overlaps y) might also touch z's boundary while being entirely within z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z's interior without touching its boundary, even though it overlaps with y.

These possibilities arise because:
- PO(x,y) ensures x and y share interior parts but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(y,z) ensures y is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.
- The overlap between x and y implies x must intersect z, but x could be partially outside z (PO), entirely inside while touching the boundary (TPP), or entirely inside without touching the boundary (NTPP).

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
