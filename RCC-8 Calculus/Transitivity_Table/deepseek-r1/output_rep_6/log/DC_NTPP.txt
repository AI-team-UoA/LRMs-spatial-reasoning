PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x, y) and NTPP(y, z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x, z)**: x is disconnected from z. Since y is entirely inside z (NTPP(y, z)) and x is disconnected from y, x could be entirely outside z.
- **EC(x, z)**: x touches z externally. x could be outside z but share a boundary point with z, without overlapping its interior, and still be disconnected from y (which is strictly inside z).
- **PO(x, z)**: x partially overlaps z. Part of x is inside z, but not overlapping y (due to DC(x, y)), and part is outside z.
- **TPP(x, z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, but is disjoint from y (which is also inside z but not touching the boundary).
- **NTPP(x, z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x is entirely inside z without touching the boundary and is disjoint from y.

The relations **TPPi**, **NTPPi**, and **EQ** are impossible:
- TPPi(x, z) or NTPPi(x, z) would imply z is a proper part of x, meaning y (inside z) would be inside x, contradicting DC(x, y).
- EQ(x, z) would mean x and z are the same, so y inside z would be inside x, again contradicting DC(x, y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
