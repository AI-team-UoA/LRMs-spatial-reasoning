PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping, as x shares some interior parts with z (via its overlap with y inside z), but has parts outside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part, where x is entirely inside z and touches z’s boundary, while partially overlapping y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part, where x is entirely inside z without touching its boundary, while partially overlapping y.

These arise because:
- NTPP(y,z) ensures y is entirely contained in z’s interior (no boundary contact).
- PO(x,y) means x overlaps y but extends beyond it.
- The part of x overlapping y must lie inside z, while the part beyond y may be inside z (leading to TPP/NTPP) or outside z (leading to PO).

Thus, EQ, DC, EC, TPPi, and NTPPi are impossible, as x cannot be equal to z (since y is a proper part of z and x is not contained in y), and z cannot be part of x (as z contains y and x only partially overlaps y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
