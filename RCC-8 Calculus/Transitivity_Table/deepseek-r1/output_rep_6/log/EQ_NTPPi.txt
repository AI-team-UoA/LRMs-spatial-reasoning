PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident, meaning they are spatially identical. NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e., NTPP(z,y)). Since x and y are identical, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,x). This is the only possible relation given the premises, as the RCC-8 relations are pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
