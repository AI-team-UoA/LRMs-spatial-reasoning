PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we have:
- NTPPi(x,y) implies NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) implies NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since NTPP is transitive in RCC-8, NTPP(z,y) and NTPP(y,x) imply NTPP(z,x). Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible, as z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so x and z cannot be equal.
- PO(x,z), EC(x,z), DC(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPP(x,z) are all inconsistent with the transitivity of NTPP and the given conditions. Specifically, z must be entirely within x without touching its boundary, ruling out tangential, partial overlap, or disconnected relations.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
