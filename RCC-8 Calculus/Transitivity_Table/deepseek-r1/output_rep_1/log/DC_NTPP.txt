PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (no common parts).
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely contained within z without touching its boundary).

Analysis of possible relations between x and z:
1. **DC(x,z)**: x is disconnected from z. Since x has no parts in common with y and y is inside z, x could be entirely outside z.
2. **EC(x,z)**: x touches z at a boundary but shares no interior parts. This is possible if x contacts z's boundary without overlapping y (which is interior to z).
3. **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps z but neither is a part of the other. This occurs if x overlaps a region of z not occupied by y.
4. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). Feasible if x is within z, disjoint from y, and contacts z's boundary.
5. **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z without touching its boundary). Possible if x is contained in z, disjoint from y, and does not touch the boundary.

Excluded relations:
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: Would imply z is inside x, but then y (inside z) would overlap x, contradicting DC(x,y).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Would imply x and z are the same, but then x would contain y, contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
