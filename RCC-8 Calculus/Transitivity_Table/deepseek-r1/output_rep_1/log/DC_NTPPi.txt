PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the spatial relationship between x and z must be disconnected (DC). This is because z is entirely contained within y as a non-tangential proper part (not touching y's boundary), and x is disconnected from y (sharing no points). Therefore, x and z cannot share any spatial points, leading to DC(x,z) as the only possible relation.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
