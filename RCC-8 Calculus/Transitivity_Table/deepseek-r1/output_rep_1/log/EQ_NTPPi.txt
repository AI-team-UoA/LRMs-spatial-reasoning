PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are spatially coincident, meaning they are identical in spatial extent. NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y, so z is entirely contained within y and does not touch its boundary.

Since x and y are equal, the spatial relationship between x and z must mirror that between y and z. Therefore, z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. This corresponds to the relation NTPPi(x,z), which is defined as NTPP(z,x).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) would imply no connection or only boundary contact, but z is inside x.
- PO(x,z) would imply partial overlap without containment, but z is entirely within x.
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are equal, but z is a proper part of y (and thus x).
- TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z) would imply tangential contact, but z does not touch the boundary.
- NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a non-tangential part of z, but here z is part of x.

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).
