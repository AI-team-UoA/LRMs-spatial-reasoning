PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. The composition table for RCC-8 indicates that EC(x,y) composed with PO(y,z) results in the following possible relations for (x,z): DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This occurs if x and z are positioned such that they do not interact, for example, if x is connected to y away from the region where y and z overlap.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This is possible if the connection point between x and y coincides with the boundary of the overlap between y and z.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being part of the other. This can happen if x extends into the region where z overlaps y or if the spatial arrangement causes shared interior points.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if z extends to cover the location of x, and x is positioned to touch z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. This can occur if z covers x completely without x reaching z's boundary.

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible:
- TPPi (or TPP(z,x)) and NTPPi (or NTPP(z,x)) would require z to be part of x, but since z has interior parts in y (due to PO(y,z)) and y's interior is disjoint from x (due to EC(x,y)), z cannot be entirely contained within x.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because x and y are distinct with only boundary contact, and y and z are distinct with partial overlap, so x and z cannot be coincident.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
