PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations TPPi(x,y) (which is equivalent to TPP(y,x)) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:

- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident. This is possible because y can be a tangential proper part of both x and z when x and z are identical.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This occurs if x is contained within z and touches z's boundary, consistent with y touching both boundaries.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP). This occurs if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary, with y positioned at the contact point.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if they share an interior region including y, and y touches the boundaries of both at a common point.

Other relations are excluded:
- **DC**, **EC**: Impossible because x and z share y as a common part.
- **NTPP**, **NTPPi**: Impossible because y touching the boundaries requires tangential contact, which non-tangential parts avoid.
- **No other relations**: The exhaustive set of RCC-8 relations has been evaluated.

Thus, the possible relationships are EQ, TPP, TPPi, and PO.
