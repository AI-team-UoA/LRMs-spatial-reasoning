PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The RCC-8 relations are defined for regions that may be disconnected. Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relations between x and z include all eight due to variations in region connectivity and arrangements:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if y is disconnected, with x overlapping one part of y and z overlapping another disconnected part, and x and z share no parts.  
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if y is disconnected, with x and z overlapping separate parts of y, and x and z touch only at a boundary without sharing interior.  
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x, y, and z all partially overlap pairwise without containment (e.g., three overlapping disks).  
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z (e.g., x inside z, touching boundary), and y overlaps both without being contained.  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z (e.g., x entirely inside z without touching boundary), and y overlaps both without being contained.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of TPP, meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (e.g., z inside x, touching boundary), with y overlapping both.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of NTPP, meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (e.g., z entirely inside x without touching boundary), with y overlapping both.  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Possible if x and z are the same region, and y partially overlaps them.  

Thus, all eight relations are possible depending on the spatial configuration.
