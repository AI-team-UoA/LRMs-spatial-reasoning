PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. Based on the RCC-8 composition table and spatial reasoning:

- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected with no shared parts.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected, touching at a boundary but with no interior overlap.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if x is positioned away from both y and z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x touches z without overlapping interiors, and x does not touch y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This can happen if x and z share some interior parts, but x remains disconnected from y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is consistent if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, while x remains disconnected from y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z without touching its boundary, and x remains disconnected from y.

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply that z is part of x, but since EC(y,z) means y touches z, this would require y to touch x, contradicting DC(x,y).
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are identical, but then EC(y,z) implies EC(y,x), contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
