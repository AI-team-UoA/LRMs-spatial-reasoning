PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z, y), the possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:

- TPP(x, y) implies x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(z, y) implies z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y but does not touch y's boundary.

Both x and z are parts of y, but their relative positions can vary:
1. **DC(x, z)**: x and z are disconnected. Example: x is near one part of y's boundary, and z is in the interior away from x.
2. **EC(x, z)**: x and z touch externally. Example: x touches y's boundary, and z is adjacent to x in the interior, sharing a boundary point.
3. **PO(x, z)**: x and z partially overlap. Example: x is a tangential region, and z overlaps with part of x but not entirely.
4. **TPPi(x, z)**: This is the inverse of TPP, meaning TPP(z, x). Example: z is a tangential proper part of x (e.g., x is a ring near y's boundary, and z is a part of the ring touching its inner boundary).
5. **NTPPi(x, z)**: This is the inverse of NTPP, meaning NTPP(z, x). Example: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (e.g., x is a ring near y's boundary, and z is entirely inside the ring without touching its boundaries).

The relations TPP(x, z), NTPP(x, z), TPPi(z, x), NTPPi(z, x), and EQ(x, z) are impossible because:
- x cannot be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP) as z is interior to y, but x touches y's boundary, leading to a contradiction.
- z cannot be a proper part of x in a way that conflicts with the given relations (handled by TPPi and NTPPi above).
- EQ requires equality, but x and z are distinct based on their relations with y.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
