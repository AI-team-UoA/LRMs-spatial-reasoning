PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely within y and shares a boundary with y.
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- Since x is a part of y and y is disconnected from z, x must also be disconnected from z. Any point in x is also in y, so if y and z have no common points, x and z cannot have any common points.
- No other RCC-8 relations (EC, PO, EQ, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi) are possible, as they would imply some spatial overlap or connection between x and z, contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
