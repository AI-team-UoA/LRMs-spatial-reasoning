PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y, touches y's boundary, and x ≠ y.
- TPPi(y,z): equivalent to TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is part of y, touches y's boundary, and z ≠ y.

Possible relations between x and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, both touching y's boundary but not overlapping or touching each other (e.g., two non-adjacent disks inside a larger disk).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally. This is possible if x and z share a boundary point but do not overlap interiors (e.g., two adjacent rectangles inside a larger rectangle, both touching the outer boundary).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior area but neither is entirely contained in the other (e.g., two overlapping polygons inside y, both extending to y's boundary).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are identical. This is possible if x and z refer to the same region (e.g., x = z), satisfying both TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y) since they describe the same relationship with y.

Excluded relations:
- **TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z)**: If x were a tangential proper part of z (or vice versa), it would conflict with the requirement that both x and z directly touch y's boundary. For instance, if TPP(x,z) held, x would be inside z and thus separated from y's boundary by z, contradicting TPP(x,y).
- **NTPP(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper parts imply no boundary contact, which would similarly prevent x or z from touching y's boundary as required.
- No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as the set is exhaustive.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, and EQ.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, EQ
