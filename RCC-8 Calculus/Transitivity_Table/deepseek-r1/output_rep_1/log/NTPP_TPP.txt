PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relation between x and z.

- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y: x is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z: y is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z.

Since x is inside y (non-tangentially, so away from y's boundary) and y is inside z (touching z's boundary), x must be entirely within z. However, x does not touch y's boundary, and since y touches z's boundary only at its own boundary (which x avoids), x remains entirely within the interior of z and does not touch z's boundary. Thus, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

The relation EQ(x,z) is impossible because x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, so x cannot equal z. TPP(x,z) is also impossible because x does not touch z's boundary. Other relations (DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi) are excluded because x is entirely within z.

Therefore, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).
