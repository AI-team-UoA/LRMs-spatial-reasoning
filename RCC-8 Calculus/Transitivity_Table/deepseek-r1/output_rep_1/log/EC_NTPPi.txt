PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

- EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected; they share boundary points but no interior points.
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y; z is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- Since z is strictly interior to y and x only touches y's boundary without sharing interior points, x and z share no points at all. Therefore, they are disconnected, leading to DC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- EC(x,z) is impossible because z has no boundary points accessible to x; x touches y's boundary, but z is not on the boundary.
- PO(x,z) is impossible because there is no overlap; x and y share no interior, and z is within y, so x and z cannot share any parts.
- Part relations (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi) are impossible because x and z are disjoint; neither can be part of the other.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible as x and z are distinct regions.

Thus, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).
