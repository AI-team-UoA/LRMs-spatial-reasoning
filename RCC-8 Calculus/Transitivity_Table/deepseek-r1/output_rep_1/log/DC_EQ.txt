PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected (no shared parts).
- EQ(y, z): y and z are coincident (identical regions).

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y, z)), the spatial relationship between x and z must mirror that between x and y. Therefore, if x is disconnected from y, it must also be disconnected from z.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x, z).

### Answer: DC(x, z)
