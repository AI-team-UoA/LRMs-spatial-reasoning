PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived as follows:

- **TPP(x,y)**: x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely within y and touches y's boundary.
- **PO(y,z)**: y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is part of the other.

Considering the spatial constraints:
- x is entirely within y (from TPP(x,y)).
- y and z overlap partially (from PO(y,z)), so y has parts inside and outside z.

Thus, x can be:
1. **Entirely in the part of y that does not overlap with z**: leading to DC(x,z) (disconnected).
2. **Partially in the overlapping region of y and z and partially outside**: leading to PO(x,z) (partial overlap).
3. **Entirely within the overlapping region of y and z**:
   - If x touches z's boundary: TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part).
   - If x does not touch z's boundary: NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part).

Other relations are impossible:
- EQ(x,z) is excluded because x is a proper part of y, and y is not coincident with z (due to PO(y,z)).
- EC(x,z) is excluded because if x and z share no interior, it would be DC, but if they touch, the interior sharing in PO(y,z) prevents EC.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is part of x, but x is part of y and y is not part of z (from PO(y,z)), leading to contradiction.

Therefore, the possible relations are DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
