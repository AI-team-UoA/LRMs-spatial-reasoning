PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (identical spatial regions), and DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (no shared parts), then x and z must also be disconnected. This is because x and y are the same region, so the relationship between x and z is identical to that between y and z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
