PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), which means x and y are coincident (i.e., x = y). Also given TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y) (meaning z is a tangential proper part of y). Since x = y, we substitute y with x, resulting in TPP(z,x). This is equivalent to TPPi(x,z) by definition.

- TPP(z,x) implies:
  - z is a proper part of x (so z ≠ x).
  - z touches the boundary of x.
- Therefore, the relation between x and z must be TPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Not possible because z is part of x (they share parts).
- **EC(x,z)**: Not possible because EC requires touching only at boundaries without shared interiors, but z is inside x.
- **PO(x,z)**: Not possible because PO requires overlapping without one being part of the other, but z is a proper part of x.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Not possible because TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, but here z is part of x (contradiction).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Not possible because NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, but z is smaller than x and inside it.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Not possible because NTPPi(x,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), but TPP(z,x) is tangential, not non-tangential.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Not possible because TPP(z,x) implies z ≠ x.

Thus, the only possible relation is TPPi.
