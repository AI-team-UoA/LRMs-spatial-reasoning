PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by considering the spatial interactions. Since PO(x,y) indicates partial overlap (they share some parts but each has distinct parts), and DC(y,z) indicates disconnection (no shared parts), the relation between x and z can vary based on how the non-overlapping part of x (with y) interacts with z.

- The part of x that overlaps with y must be disjoint from z (because y and z are disjoint).  
- The part of x that does not overlap with y can have different relations with z:  
  - If this part is entirely disjoint from z, then x and z are disconnected: DC(x,z).  
  - If this part touches z only at boundaries without sharing interior parts, then x and z are externally connected: EC(x,z).  
  - If this part partially overlaps with z, sharing interior parts but not being parts of each other, then x and z partially overlap: PO(x,z).  
  - If z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is inside x and touches x's boundary), then TPPi(x,z) holds (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).  
  - If z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is inside x without touching the boundary), then NTPPi(x,z) holds (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)).  

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:  
- TPP/NTPP(x,z) would require x to be part of z, but the part of x overlapping with y is disjoint from z, so x cannot be part of z.  
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be coincident, but they cannot be since part of x (overlapping with y) is disjoint from z.  

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.  

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
