PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary. PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap, sharing some common parts but neither being a part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This occurs if x is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z.
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. This occurs if x is partially within the overlapping region of y and z and partially outside it.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part. This occurs if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part. This occurs if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and does not touch z's boundary.

The relations EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EC(x,z) are not possible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be identical, but x is a proper part of y and y is not equal to z.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a part of x, but x is a proper part of y and cannot contain z, which overlaps y partially and extends beyond it.
- EC(x,z) would require x and z to touch at a boundary without sharing interior points, but since x is strictly interior to y and y shares interior points with z, x and z cannot touch without sharing interior.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
