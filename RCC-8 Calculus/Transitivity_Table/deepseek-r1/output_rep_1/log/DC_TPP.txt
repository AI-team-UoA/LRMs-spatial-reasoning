PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The composition table yields:

- **DC(x,z)**: x is disconnected from z. Since x has no connection to y and y is inside z, x could be entirely outside z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x externally connects to z. x could touch z's boundary without overlapping, provided it avoids y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps z. x may share an interior part with z that does not intersect y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. x could be inside z and touch z's boundary, without overlapping y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x could be entirely inside z without touching its boundary, and remain disjoint from y.

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible because they would imply z is part of x or x equals z, contradicting DC(x,y) (since y is part of z, leading to overlap between x and y).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
