PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts but neither being a subset of the other. TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y, so z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Considering the spatial configurations:
- If z is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with x (i.e., z ⊆ y \ x), then x and z may be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC), depending on whether they share boundary points.
- If z is entirely within the overlapping region of x and y (i.e., z ⊆ x ∩ y), then z is a proper part of x, so the relation could be TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x) or NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x).
- If z is partially within the overlapping region and partially within the non-overlapping part of y, then x and z partially overlap, resulting in PO(x,z).

Other relations are not possible:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because z is a proper part of y, while x is not a subset of y (from PO(x,y)).
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x is a proper part of z, but z is a proper part of y, so x would be a part of y, contradicting PO(x,y).
- Similarly, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are covered as inverses when z is part of x.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
