PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x and touches the boundary of x. Additionally, PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap; they share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other.

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if z overlaps x but extends outside x. Since y is inside x and overlaps z, z may share parts with x beyond y and have parts outside x.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within x, touches x's boundary, and overlaps y (which is also inside x).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within x, does not touch x's boundary, and overlaps y.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Not possible because y overlaps z and is part of x, so x and z share parts.
- **EC(x,z)**: Not possible because y and z share interior parts (from PO(y,z)), and y's interior is part of x's interior, so x and z share interior parts.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Not possible because if x were a proper part of z, then y (part of x) would be part of z, contradicting PO(y,z) (which requires y not part of z).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Similarly impossible, as it would imply y is part of z.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Not possible because PO(y,z) and TPP(y,x) imply y and x are not equal (since y is a proper part of x), and if x and z were equal, PO(y,x) would contradict TPP(y,x).

Thus, the possible relations are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
