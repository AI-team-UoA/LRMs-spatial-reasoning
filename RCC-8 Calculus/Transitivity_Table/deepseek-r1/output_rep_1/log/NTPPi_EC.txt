PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), we analyze the possible relationships between x and z.

- NTPPi(x,y) implies NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch its boundary.
- EC(y,z) indicates that y and z touch externally at their boundaries but share no interior parts.

The point of contact between y and z lies on the boundary of y. Since y is non-tangential in x, this point is interior to x. Therefore, x and z must share this point, ruling out DC (disconnected) and EQ (equal), as equality would imply y inside z, contradicting EC(y,z). EC(x,z) is impossible because the shared point is interior to x, not on its boundary. TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are excluded since they imply x is inside z, leading to y inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

The possible relations are:
- **PO (partial overlap)**: x and z share some but not all parts. For example, z overlaps partially with x, and y inside x touches z at a boundary point interior to x.
- **TPPi (tangential proper part inverse)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Here, z touches the boundary of x but is contained within it, and y inside x touches z.
- **NTPPi (non-tangential proper part inverse)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, z is entirely inside x without touching its boundary, and y inside x touches z.

These relations cover all consistent scenarios without contradictions.
