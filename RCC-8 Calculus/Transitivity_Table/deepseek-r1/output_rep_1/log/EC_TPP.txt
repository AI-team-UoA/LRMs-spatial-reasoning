PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected. This occurs when x is entirely outside z but touches the boundary of z at the point where x and y connect.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This happens when x extends partially into z's interior (beyond the boundary contact point) but is not entirely contained within z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This arises when x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary at the connection point with y.

These relations are derived from the constraints:
- EC(x,y) ensures x and y share a boundary but no interior.
- TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- The point of contact between x and y lies on z's boundary, leading to the above possibilities.

Other relations (DC, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are impossible due to contradictions:
- DC is excluded because x and z must touch at the boundary point.
- NTPP is impossible as x must touch z's boundary at the contact point.
- TPPi/NTPPi imply z is inside x, conflicting with y being inside z and EC(x,y).
- EQ is inconsistent as x and z would share all parts, but y's relation to both contradicts.

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z)
