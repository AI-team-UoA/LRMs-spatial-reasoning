PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z):  
- NTPP(x,y) implies that x is entirely contained within the interior of y, without touching y's boundary.  
- DC(y,z) implies that y and z share no points (disconnected).  

Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (entirely inside y), any point of x is also a point of y. Because y and z are disconnected (no shared points), x and z cannot share any points. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ would require some spatial overlap or connection, contradicting DC(y,z).  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
