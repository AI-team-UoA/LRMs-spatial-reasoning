PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), we have:
- NTPP(x,y) implies x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y without touching its boundary).
- NTPP(z,y) implies z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely inside y without touching its boundary).

The possible relations between x and z cover all eight RCC-8 relations, as no constraints prevent any spatial configuration between them within y. Examples:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disjoint (e.g., two separate circles inside y).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally (e.g., two circles inside y sharing a boundary point).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (e.g., two overlapping circles inside y).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (e.g., x inside z and touching z's boundary).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (e.g., x entirely inside z without touching its boundary).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP, e.g., z inside x and touching x's boundary).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP, e.g., z entirely inside x without touching its boundary).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (x = z).

Thus, all relations are possible.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
