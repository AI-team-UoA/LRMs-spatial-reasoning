PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y), which means x and y are spatially coincident (identical regions), and TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary).

Since x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), the relationship between x and z must be the same as between y and z. Therefore, TPP(y,z) directly implies TPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) are impossible because x is part of z.
- PO(x,z) is impossible because x is entirely within z, not partially overlapping.
- NTPP(x,z) is impossible because TPP specifies tangential contact, which must hold.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because z cannot be a proper part of x while x is part of z.
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because y (and thus x) is a proper part of z, so x cannot equal z.

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
