PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), we need to find the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y, so z is entirely within y and touches y's boundary.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This is possible if x and z are separated within y, e.g., x is in the interior away from z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, touching at a boundary but sharing no interior parts. This is possible if x is adjacent to z but does not overlap, e.g., x touches z at a point.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x and z share a common region but neither contains the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z, so x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if z contains x and x is near z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so x is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary. This is possible if z contains x and x is in z's interior.

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:
- TPPi(x,z) (equivalent to TPP(z,x)) and NTPPi(x,z) (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) would require z to be part of x, but since z touches y's boundary and x does not, this would imply x touches y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,y).
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because x does not touch y's boundary while z does.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer:  
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
