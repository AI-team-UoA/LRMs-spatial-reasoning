PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. EC(x,y) means that x and y are externally connected (they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts), and NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary).

The point where x and y touch is within the interior of z, since y is entirely inside z and not touching its boundary. This implies that x must share some spatial region with z, but the exact relationship depends on the configuration:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is possible, where x and z share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other. For example, x could overlap with z and touch y internally.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part is possible, where x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. For instance, x could be inside z, touching its boundary, and also touching y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part is possible, where x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. For example, both x and y could be entirely inside z without touching its boundary, and x touches y.

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because x and z share a common point (the touch point between x and y).
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected is impossible because the touch point between x and y is not on z's boundary.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal is impossible because x and y are distinct, and y is a proper part of z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse tangential proper part (equivalent to TPP(z,x)) is impossible because it would imply z is part of x, contradicting EC(x,y) as x and y would share interior points.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse non-tangential proper part (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

Thus, the only possible relations are PO, TPP, and NTPP.
