PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x, y) and PO(y, z), the possible relations between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition. Since x is entirely disconnected from y (no shared parts), and y partially overlaps with z (sharing parts but neither containing the other), the following relations for x and z are possible:

- **DC(x, z)**: x and z are disconnected (no shared parts).  
  *Example: x is completely separate from z, avoiding the overlapping region of y and z.*  
- **EC(x, z)**: x and z touch externally at a boundary but share no interior.  
  *Example: x touches the non-overlapping part of z, without interior overlap.*  
- **PO(x, z)**: x and z partially overlap (share interior and boundary but neither contains the other).  
  *Example: x overlaps with the part of z that does not intersect y.*  
- **TPP(x, z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary).  
  *Example: x is entirely within the non-overlapping part of z and touches its boundary.*  
- **NTPP(x, z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z without touching its boundary).  
  *Example: x is deep inside the non-overlapping part of z, not touching any boundary.*  

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible:  
- TPPi/NTPPi would require z to be a proper part of x, but this conflicts with DC(x, y) since z overlaps y.  
- EQ would imply x and z are identical, contradicting DC(x, y) and PO(y, z).  

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
