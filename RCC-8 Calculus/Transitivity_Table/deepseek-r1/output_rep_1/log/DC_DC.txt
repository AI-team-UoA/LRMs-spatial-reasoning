PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations. This is because the disconnection from y does not impose any constraints on the relationship between x and z; they can be disconnected, connected, or even coincident, as long as both remain disconnected from y. Therefore, all eight relations are possible:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch externally.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
