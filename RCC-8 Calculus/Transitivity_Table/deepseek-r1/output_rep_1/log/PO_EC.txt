PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by considering the spatial configurations:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if the part of x that overlaps with y does not extend to the boundary where y and z touch, and the non-overlapping part of x is away from z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary. This happens if the overlapping part of x and y extends to the boundary where y and z touch, causing x and z to meet at that boundary without sharing interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if the non-overlapping part of x (with respect to y) extends into the region of z, sharing interior parts, without violating the given relations.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely inside x and touches the boundary of x, with the boundary where y and z touch being within x.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x, and the boundary where y and z touch is inside x.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would require the interior of x (which overlaps with y) to be inside z, leading to an interior overlap between y and z, contradicting EC(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) would imply x and z are identical, but PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) cannot hold simultaneously if x equals z.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
