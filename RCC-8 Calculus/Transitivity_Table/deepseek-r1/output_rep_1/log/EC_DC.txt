PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This is possible if z is entirely separate from both x and y, or if the arrangement prevents any contact between x and z (e.g., y is adjacent to x, but z is located away from both).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, sharing a boundary but no interior parts. This is possible if z is adjacent to x at a boundary not shared with y (e.g., x is between y and z, with y and z disconnected).

Other relations are not possible:
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap would imply shared interior parts, which could force y and z to share a boundary (contradicting DC(y,z)).
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: Part-of relations would imply spatial containment, leading to y and z sharing a boundary or parts (contradicting DC(y,z)).
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equality would imply x and z are the same, but EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) cannot both hold if x and z coincide.

Thus, the only possible relations are DC and EC.
