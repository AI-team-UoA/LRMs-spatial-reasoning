PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is entirely contained within the interior of x and does not touch the boundary of x.

Given TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. This implies that z is entirely contained within y and touches the boundary of y.

Since z is contained within y and y is contained within the interior of x, z must be entirely contained within x. Because y does not touch the boundary of x, and z is within y, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

The composition of RCC-8 relations confirms that NTPPi(x,y) composed with TPPi(y,z) results in NTPPi(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as z must be a proper part of x without touching its boundary, and other relations like DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, or EQ are inconsistent with the given constraints.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi.
