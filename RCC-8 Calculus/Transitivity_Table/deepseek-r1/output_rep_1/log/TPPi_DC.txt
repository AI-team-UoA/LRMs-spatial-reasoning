PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is part of x and touches the boundary of x. Also given DC(y,z), meaning y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

The possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table, considering the spatial constraints:

- **DC(x,z)**: z is disconnected from x, sharing no parts. This is possible if z is entirely outside x and not touching it.
- **EC(x,z)**: z is externally connected to x, touching at a boundary point not occupied by y. Since y only touches part of x's boundary, this is possible if z touches x elsewhere.
- **PO(x,z)**: z partially overlaps with x but neither is part of the other, and the overlap does not involve y. Since y is a proper part of x (not the whole), this is possible if z overlaps x in a region disjoint from y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This means TPP(z,x), so z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is inside x, touches x's boundary at a point not shared with y, and is disconnected from y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This means NTPP(z,x), so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely inside x, not touching the boundary, and disconnected from y.

Relations not possible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Not possible because if x and z were equal, y (part of x) would overlap with z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **TPP(x,z)**: Not possible because this would mean x is part of z, so y (part of x) would be part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z); it would imply y overlaps with z.
- **TPP and NTPP from z to x are covered by TPPi and NTPPi**: TPP(z,x) is TPPi(x,z), and NTPP(z,x) is NTPPi(x,z), which are already included.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.
