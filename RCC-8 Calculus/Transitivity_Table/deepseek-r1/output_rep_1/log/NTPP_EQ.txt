PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relation between x and z is determined by the identity of y and z due to EQ(y,z). NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, implying x is entirely within y, not touching its boundary. Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), x must also be entirely within z, not touching its boundary. Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer:  
NTPP(x,z)
