PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Also, EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions). Therefore, z must be the same as y in relation to x. Thus, z is also a tangential proper part of x. This corresponds to TPPi(x,z), as TPPi(x,z) is defined as TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because the identity (EQ) directly transfers the relation from y to z.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
