{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (i.e., identical spatial regions), and EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident, it follows that x and z must also be coincident due to the transitive property of equality. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 55.361546754837036, "reasoning-tokens": 906, "completion-tokens": 983}
