PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are analyzed as follows:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if the part of x outside y does not interact with z.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if the part of x outside y touches z's boundary without interior overlap.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if the part of x outside y overlaps with z's interior partially, without containment.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Possible if z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., z ⊆ x and touches x's boundary), consistent with the constraints.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Possible if z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., z ⊆ x without touching x's boundary), consistent with the constraints.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible:
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would imply x ⊆ z, forcing the part of x overlapping y to be in z's interior, contradicting EC(y,z) (interiors disjoint).
- EQ(x,z) would imply PO(x,y) and EC(y,x), which is inconsistent (PO requires shared interior, EC requires disjoint interiors).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
