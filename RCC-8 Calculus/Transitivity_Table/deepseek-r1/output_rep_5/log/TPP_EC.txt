PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. This occurs if the boundary contact between x and y does not coincide with the boundary contact between y and z. Since x is entirely within y and z is outside y (except at the boundary), they may not share any points.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally. This occurs if the boundary point where x touches y is the same as where y touches z. Since x is a tangential part of y, it can inherit the boundary contact with z.

Other relations are impossible:
- **PO(x,z)**: Cannot occur because x is entirely within y, and z has no interior overlap with y (due to EC(y,z)).
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**: Cannot occur because z is not a superset of y (as EC(y,z) implies z is outside y), and x is confined within y.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Cannot occur since x is a proper part of y, and z is distinct and external to y.

Thus, the only possible relations are DC and EC.
