PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (equivalent to TPP(z,y)), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. This occurs if the boundary point where x touches y is not shared with z. Since z is inside y and x is outside y (except at the boundary), they may have no contact.
- **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. This occurs if the boundary point where x touches y is also a boundary point of z (since z touches y's boundary). Their interiors remain disjoint, but they share a boundary point.

Other relations are impossible:
- PO(x,z) is excluded because x and z cannot share interior parts (x is outside y, z is inside y).
- TPP/NTPP and their inverses are excluded because neither region can be a proper part of the other (x is outside y, z is inside y).
- EQ(x,z) is excluded as the regions are not coincident.

### Answer: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z)
