PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we derive the possible relations between x and z.  
- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x.  
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.  

Using the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of NTPP⁻¹ (i.e., NTPPi) and NTPP yields the following possible relations between x and z:  
1. **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (equal).  
2. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.  
3. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is part of z and touches z's boundary).  
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(z,x)).  
5. **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is part of z without touching the boundary).  
6. **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)).  

These are all possible relations, as confirmed by the RCC-8 calculus composition rules.
