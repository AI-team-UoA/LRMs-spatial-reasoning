PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z). TPP(x,y) indicates that x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely within y and touches y's boundary. PO(y,z) indicates that y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but each having parts not shared by the other.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, consider the spatial configurations:

1. **DC(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z. Since PO(y,z) implies that part of y is outside z, x could be in that non-overlapping region, making x and z disconnected.
2. **EC(x,z)**: Possible if x is within the non-overlapping part of y but adjacent to the boundary where y and z overlap. Since x touches y's boundary, and the overlap region is part of z, x may touch z's boundary externally.
3. **PO(x,z)**: Possible if x extends into both the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y with respect to z. Thus, x and z share some interior parts but not all, satisfying partial overlap.
4. **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the overlapping part of y and z and touches z's boundary. Since x is a tangential proper part of y and y overlaps z, x could similarly touch z's boundary while being inside z.
5. **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is entirely within the overlapping part of y and z but does not touch z's boundary. This occurs if x is deeply embedded within the overlap region.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Cannot occur because x is a proper part of y (since TPP(x,y)), and y is not equal to z (since PO(y,z) implies y and z are not coincident).
- **TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)**: Cannot occur because z cannot be a proper part of x. PO(y,z) means z has parts outside y, and since x is inside y, z cannot be contained in x.
- **PO(x,z) already covered**: No additional relations.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) or PO(x,z) or TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
