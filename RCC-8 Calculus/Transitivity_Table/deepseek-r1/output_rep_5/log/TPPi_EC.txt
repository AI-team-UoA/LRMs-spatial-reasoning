PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x and touches the boundary of x. Additionally, EC(y,z) indicates that y and z are externally connected, sharing a boundary but no interior parts.

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

- **EC(x,z)**: z is outside x and touches x at the boundary. Since y touches the boundary of x and z touches y at that boundary, z can be externally connected to x.
- **PO(x,z)**: z partially overlaps x. This is possible because z can extend into x's interior (overlapping) while still touching y at the boundary of x, without violating the disjoint interiors requirement of EC(y,z).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, z is inside x and touches its boundary. Since y is also inside x and touches the boundary, z can be adjacent to y at the boundary, satisfying EC(y,z).

Other relations are impossible:
- **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected is impossible because z touches y, which is part of x, so x and z are connected.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x cannot be a tangential proper part of z, as that would imply x is inside z, but y is inside x, leading to y being inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).
- **NTPP(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: Non-tangential parts are impossible because z must touch the boundary to connect with y, which is at the boundary of x.
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equality is impossible as z would then contain y, contradicting EC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z)
