PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we need to find the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, so y is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, so z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since y is a non-tangential proper part of x, y is in the interior of x with no contact with x's boundary. z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is contained within y and touches y's boundary. Because y is wholly inside x and not near x's boundary, z (being within y) is also entirely inside x and cannot touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

This means that NTPP(z,x) holds, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z). There are no other possible relations, as other RCC-8 relations (e.g., DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, EQ) are inconsistent with the given conditions and the part-whole relationships.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).
