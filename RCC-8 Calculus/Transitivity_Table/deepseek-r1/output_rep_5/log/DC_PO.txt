PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the spatial constraints. Since x is disconnected from y and y partially overlaps with z, x must not share any part with y. However, x can interact with the parts of z that do not overlap with y. The possible relations are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. Example: x is entirely separate from both y and z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary). Example: x touches z at a point not overlapping with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. Example: x overlaps a part of z that does not intersect y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. Example: x is inside z and touches z's boundary, entirely outside y.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Example: x is completely contained within z without touching its boundary, and disjoint from y.

Impossible relations include:
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: This would imply z is a proper part of x, forcing x to share a part with y (via PO(y,z)), contradicting DC(x,y).
- **EQ(x,z)**: This would make x and z the same region, implying DC(x,y) and PO(y,x) cannot hold simultaneously.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
