PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. PO(x,y) indicates that x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a part of the other. DC(y,z) indicates that y and z are disconnected, sharing no parts. The composition of these relations allows for the following possibilities between x and z:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected, sharing no parts. This is possible if z is positioned such that it does not interact with x, for example, when z is far from the region where x and y overlap.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected, touching at a boundary but sharing no interior parts. This can occur if z touches a part of x that is not shared with y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being a part of the other. This is possible if z overlaps with a part of x that is exclusive to x (not shared with y).
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This can happen if z is a part of x that touches x's boundary and is not connected to y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This is equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., z is inside x but not touching its boundary). This is possible if z is contained within x in a region away from y.

Relations that are impossible include EQ(x,z) (x and z cannot be equal, as this would conflict with PO(x,y) and DC(y,z)), TPP(x,z) (x cannot be a tangential proper part of z, as this would imply a connection between y and z), and NTPP(x,z) (x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z, for similar reasons).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
