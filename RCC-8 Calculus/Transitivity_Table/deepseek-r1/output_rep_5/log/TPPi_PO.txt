PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is part of x, touches x's boundary, and is not equal to x. Also given PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap: they share interior parts, but neither is part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap is possible because z may share parts with y (which is inside x) and also extend outside x, leading to shared interior parts between x and z without containment.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is inside x, touches x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y without being contained by y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is inside x, does not touch x's boundary, and partially overlaps with y without containment.

Other relations are impossible:
- DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are excluded because x and z share interior parts through y.
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are excluded because they imply x is part of z, making y part of z, contradicting PO(y,z).
- EQ(x,z) is excluded because x and z would be equal, but y is a proper part of x, so PO(y,x) would contradict y being part of x.

Thus, the possible relationships are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
