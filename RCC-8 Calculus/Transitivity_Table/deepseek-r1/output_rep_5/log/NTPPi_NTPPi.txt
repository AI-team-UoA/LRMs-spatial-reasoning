PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we can derive the relationship between x and z.

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, y is entirely contained within x without touching its boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, z is entirely contained within y without touching its boundary.

Since NTPP is transitive in the RCC-8 calculus, NTPP(z,y) and NTPP(y,x) imply NTPP(z,x). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, for the relation between x and z, NTPP(z,x) corresponds to NTPPi(x,z), as NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x).

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).
