PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the spatial constraints. TPPi(x,y) implies TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x: y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no points.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: z is entirely outside x and shares no points with x. Since y is inside x and DC(y,z) holds, z can be disjoint from x without conflict.
- **EC(x,z)**: z touches the boundary of x externally but shares no interior points. This is possible if the contact point is not shared with y (since y touches some boundary points of x), ensuring DC(y,z) is maintained.
- **PO(x,z)**: z partially overlaps x but does not include any part of y. This avoids violating DC(y,z), as y and z remain disconnected.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x)). z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, but the contact points do not coincide with those of y, preserving DC(y,z).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(z,x)). z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary, so it avoids y's boundary contact points, maintaining DC(y,z).

Other relations are impossible:
- **TPP(x,z)**, **NTPP(x,z)**, **TPPi(y,x)** variants, or **EQ(x,z)** would imply z contains x or equals x, forcing overlap with y (inside x), violating DC(y,z).
- **NTPP(x,z)** or **TPP(x,z)** would require z to contain x, leading to the same conflict.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
