PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we need to find the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary).

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z must be a proper part of x. The relation between x and z depends on whether z touches x's boundary:
- If z touches x's boundary (e.g., at the point where y touches x), then TPP(z,x) holds, meaning TPPi(x,z).
- If z does not touch x's boundary (e.g., z touches y at an interior point of x), then NTPP(z,x) holds, meaning NTPPi(x,z).

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- DC, EC, PO: Excluded because z is entirely within x (no disconnection, external contact, or partial overlap).
- EQ: Excluded because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so z cannot be equal to x.
- TPP: Would imply x is part of z, but z is part of x and smaller, contradiction.
- NTPP: Similarly, would imply x is part of z, contradiction.

Thus, the only possible relations between x and z are TPPi and NTPPi.

### Answer:  
TPPi, NTPPi
