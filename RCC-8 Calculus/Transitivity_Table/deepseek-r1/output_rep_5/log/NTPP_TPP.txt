PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Analysis:
- Since x is entirely within the interior of y (NTPP(x,y)), and y is contained within z (TPP(y,z)), x must be entirely within z. Thus, x is a proper part of z, ruling out DC, EC, PO, EQ, TPPi, and NTPPi.
- TPP(x,z) requires x to touch z's boundary. However, x is confined to the interior of y, and y's interior is entirely within the interior of z (because TPP(y,z) implies that only the boundary of y touches z's boundary, but the interior of y is interior to z). Thus, x does not touch z's boundary, so TPP(x,z) is impossible.
- NTPP(x,z) requires x to be entirely within the interior of z without touching its boundary. This holds because x is within the interior of y, which is within the interior of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Composition table for RCC-8 confirms that NTPP composed with TPP results in NTPP.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP.
