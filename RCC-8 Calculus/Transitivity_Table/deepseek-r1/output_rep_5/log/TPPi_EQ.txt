PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z):  
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x.  
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).  

Since z is identical to y, the relationship between x and z is the same as between x and y. Thus, TPPi(x,z) holds, meaning TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible because EQ(y,z) implies z inherits y's spatial relations exactly.  

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
