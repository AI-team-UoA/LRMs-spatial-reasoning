PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z). This is because EQ(y,z) implies that y and z are identical regions. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as the equality EQ(y,z) directly transfers the relation from y to z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
