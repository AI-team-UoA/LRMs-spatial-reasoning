PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, y is entirely contained within the interior of x, sharing no boundary points with x's boundary.
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected, sharing no common points.

We analyze possible relations between x and z:

1. **DC(x,z)**: z is entirely outside x. Since y is inside x and disconnected from z, this is possible.
2. **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally at a boundary but share no interior points. Since y is entirely within the interior of x and does not touch x's boundary, y and z remain disconnected.
3. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither containing the other. This is possible if the overlap region avoids y, ensuring y and z remain disconnected.
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary). This is consistent as long as z does not overlap y, which is satisfied by DC(y,z).
5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is entirely inside x and does not touch x's boundary). Again, DC(y,z) ensures no overlap with y.

Excluded relations:
- **EQ(x,z)**: Impossible because y is inside x, so if x and z are equal, y would be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPPi(z,x) or NTPPi(z,x), meaning x is a proper part of z. This would imply y is inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting DC(y,z).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
