PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z):

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary).
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical spatial regions).

Since y and z are identical, the relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Therefore, x must be a tangential proper part of z.

Thus, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).
