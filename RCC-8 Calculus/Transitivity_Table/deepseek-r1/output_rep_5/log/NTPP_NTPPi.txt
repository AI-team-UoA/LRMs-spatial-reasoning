PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which implies NTPP(z,y), both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y. This means x and z are entirely contained within y, do not touch y's boundary, and are proper parts (so not equal to y).

The possible relationships between x and z can be any of the RCC-8 relations, as there are no restrictions preventing any specific spatial configuration between them within y. For example:
- They can be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC).
- They can partially overlap (PO).
- One can be a tangential proper part (TPP or TPPi) or non-tangential proper part (NTPP or NTPPi) of the other.
- They can be equal (EQ).

Thus, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
