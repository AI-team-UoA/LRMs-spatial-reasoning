PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).  

**Reasoning**:  
- TPP(x,y) implies x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary).  
- NTPP(y,z) implies y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary).  
- Since x is entirely within y and y is entirely within z (with no boundary contact between y and z), x must be entirely within z without touching z's boundary. Thus, x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).  
- No other RCC-8 relations are possible (e.g., DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ are excluded by the transitivity of containment and boundary conditions).
