PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the RCC-8 composition table. EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected, sharing a boundary but no interior. NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **EC(x,z)**: x is externally connected to z. This occurs if x is outside z but touches z at the boundary point where it connects to y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps with z. This occurs if x straddles the boundary of z, with part inside and part outside, and touches y inside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This occurs if x is entirely within z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y inside z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This occurs if x is entirely within z, does not touch z's boundary, and touches y inside z.

Relations such as DC(x,z) (disconnected) are impossible because x touches y, which is part of z, implying x and z share a point. EQ(x,z) (equal) is impossible as x and y are distinct and y is a proper part of z. TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) (implying z is part of x) are impossible because if z were part of x, y would be part of x, contradicting EC(x,y) which requires no shared interior parts.

Thus, the possible relationships are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
