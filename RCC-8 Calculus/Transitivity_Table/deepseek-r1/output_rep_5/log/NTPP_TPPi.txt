PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)), the possible relations between x and z are determined by the spatial constraints:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely within the interior of y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPP(z,y) means z is within y and touches y's boundary.

Possible relations between x and z:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This is possible if x and z are separate regions inside y (e.g., two non-overlapping disks in a larger disk).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally but share no interior parts. This is possible if x and z are adjacent within y without overlapping (e.g., two disks touching at a point inside y).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. This is possible if they share some interior parts but neither contains the other (e.g., a disk z touching y's boundary and a disk x overlapping half of z but extending beyond, both inside y).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x inside z and touching z's boundary). This is possible if x is near the boundary of z, which is inside y (e.g., z is a ring touching y's boundary, and x is a smaller disk inside the ring touching its inner boundary).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x inside z without touching z's boundary). This is possible if x is entirely contained in the interior of z (e.g., z is a disk touching y's boundary, and x is a smaller disk inside z, away from its boundary).

The relations TPPi(x,z) (i.e., TPP(z,x)), NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x)), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because z touches y's boundary, while x is entirely in y's interior. If z were inside x, z would not touch y's boundary, contradicting TPP(z,y).
