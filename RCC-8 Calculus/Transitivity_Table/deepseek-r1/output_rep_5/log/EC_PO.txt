PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP. These are derived from the RCC-8 composition table and spatial reasoning:

- **DC(x,z)**: Possible if z does not intersect the boundary where x and y touch, resulting in no connection between x and z.
- **EC(x,z)**: Possible if z touches x at the boundary point where x and y connect, but they share no interior parts.
- **PO(x,z)**: Possible if z extends such that it overlaps with x, sharing some interior parts but neither is part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z and shares a boundary point with z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Possible if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible because:
- TPPi or NTPPi would imply z is part of x, but PO(y,z) requires z to share interior parts with y, leading to a contradiction with EC(x,y) (no shared interior between x and y).
- EQ would require x and z to be identical, which is inconsistent with the given relations and spatial configurations.
