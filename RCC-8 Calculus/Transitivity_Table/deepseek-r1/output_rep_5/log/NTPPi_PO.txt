PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely contained within the interior of x, and x is not equal to y). Also given PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap (they share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other).

The possible relations between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap. Since y is inside x and overlaps with z, z may extend outside x while sharing some interior parts with x. Neither x nor z is part of the other.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent as z can overlap y (inside x) without being part of y.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is entirely contained within the interior of x without touching its boundary. This is also consistent with z overlapping y (inside x).

Other relations are impossible:
- DC(x,z) or EC(x,z): Cannot occur because z shares interior parts with y, which is inside x, so z must overlap with x.
- EQ(x,z): Would imply x and z are identical, but PO(y,z) and NTPP(y,x) conflict (y cannot be both a proper part of x and partially overlap with x).
- TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z): Would imply x is a proper part of z, but then y (a part of x) would be a part of z, contradicting PO(y,z) which requires y not to be part of z.

Thus, the possible relations are PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: PO, TPPi, NTPPi
