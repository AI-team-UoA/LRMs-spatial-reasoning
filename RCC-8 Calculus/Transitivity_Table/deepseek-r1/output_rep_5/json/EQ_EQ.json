{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), meaning x and y are coincident and y and z are coincident, the relation between x and z must be coincident due to transitivity. Therefore, the only possible relationship is EQ(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 17.34257984161377, "reasoning-tokens": 227, "completion-tokens": 288}
