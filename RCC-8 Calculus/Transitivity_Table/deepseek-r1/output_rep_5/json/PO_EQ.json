{"prompt": "If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), since EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical regions, the spatial relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Therefore, the only possible relationship is PO(x,z).\n\n### Answer: PO(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 75.83323979377747, "reasoning-tokens": 1427, "completion-tokens": 1487}
