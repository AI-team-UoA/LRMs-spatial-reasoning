{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are coincident (i.e., identical regions). Therefore, any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Since EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected (they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts), this relationship directly transfers to x and z. Thus, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 21.781145095825195, "reasoning-tokens": 256, "completion-tokens": 353}
