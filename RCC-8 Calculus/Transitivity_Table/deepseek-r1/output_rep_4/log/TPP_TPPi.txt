PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of the relations. Since x is a tangential proper part of y and y is a tangential proper part of z, x must be a proper part of z. The specific relation between x and z can be either tangential or non-tangential, depending on whether x touches the boundary of z.

- If x is positioned such that it touches the boundary of z (e.g., at the point where y touches z), then TPP(x,z) holds.
- If x does not touch the boundary of z (e.g., it is deep within y and not at the contact point with z), then NTPP(x,z) holds.

No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as:
- DC, EC, PO are excluded because x is part of z.
- EQ is excluded because x and z cannot be equal (x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z).
- TPPi and NTPPi are excluded because z cannot be part of x.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are TPP and NTPP.

### Answer: TPP, NTPP
