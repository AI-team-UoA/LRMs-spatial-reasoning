PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we need to find the possible relations between x and z.

- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary).

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a tangential proper part of x, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x. This is because:
- z is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- y is contained within x and touches x's boundary, but since z does not touch y's boundary, it cannot touch x's boundary either.
- Therefore, z is strictly inside x without touching its boundary, so NTPP(z,x) holds, meaning the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, so z cannot be equal to x.
- PO(x,z) is impossible because z is entirely within y and y within x, so there is no partial overlap with x.
- DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are impossible because z is part of x, so they are connected.
- TPP(x,z) is impossible because if z were tangential to x, it would need to touch x's boundary, but z is non-tangential to y and deep within y, preventing contact with x's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z) is not applicable as it would imply x is part of z, but z is part of x.
- NTPP(x,z) is not applicable as it would imply x is part of z, but z is part of x.

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPPi.
