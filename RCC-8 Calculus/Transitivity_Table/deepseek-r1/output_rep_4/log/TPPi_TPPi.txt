PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).  
- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x: y is part of x, touches x's boundary, and is not equal to x.  
- TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y: z is part of y, touches y's boundary, and is not equal to y.  

Since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, z must be a proper part of x. The relationship between x and z depends on whether z touches the boundary of x:  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: This occurs if z touches the boundary of x. Since z touches y's boundary and y touches x's boundary, it is possible for z to be at a point where y's boundary meets x's boundary, causing z to also touch x's boundary. TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: This occurs if z does not touch the boundary of x. Even though z touches y's boundary, that point of contact may be internal to x (not on x's boundary). Thus, z is a non-tangential proper part of x. NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x).  

Other relations are impossible:  
- DC, EC: Not possible as z is part of x.  
- PO: Not possible as z is entirely within x.  
- EQ: Not possible as z is a proper part of x (via y).  
- TPP, NTPP: These would require x to be part of z, but z is smaller than x.  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are TPPi and NTPPi.
