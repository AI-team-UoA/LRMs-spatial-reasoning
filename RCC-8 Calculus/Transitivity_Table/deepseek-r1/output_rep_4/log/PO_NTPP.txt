PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

- **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps with z. This occurs when x extends beyond z in some regions, meaning there is a part of x inside z (due to overlap with y, which is inside z) and a part outside z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This happens if x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of z, which is possible if the part of x outside y reaches the boundary of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This occurs if x is entirely contained within z and does not touch the boundary of z, staying within the interior buffer around y.

These possibilities arise because:
- y is entirely within z (NTPP(y,z)), so the part of x overlapping y is inside z.
- The part of x not in y may be entirely within z (leading to TPP or NTPP) or extend outside z (leading to PO).

Other relations are impossible:
- DC, EC: Excluded because x and z share interior points (from the overlap of x and y, and y inside z).
- EQ, TPPi, NTPPi: Excluded because z cannot be a proper part of x (this would require y to be entirely within x, contradicting PO(x,y) where neither is a subset of the other).

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP
