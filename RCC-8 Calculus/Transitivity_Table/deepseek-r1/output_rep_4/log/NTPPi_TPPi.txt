PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), and TPPi(y,z) which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- NTPP(y,x) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x: y is entirely contained within the interior of x, not touching its boundary.
- TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y: z is part of y and touches the boundary of y.

Since y is inside x without touching x's boundary, the boundary of y lies entirely within the interior of x. Thus, z, which touches the boundary of y, must also lie entirely within the interior of x. Furthermore, z is a proper part of x because:
- z is part of y (from TPP(z,y)),
- y is part of x (from NTPP(y,x)).

However, z does not touch the boundary of x because the boundary of y (which z touches) is separated from x's boundary by the non-tangential condition of y in x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, leading to NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

The RCC-8 composition table confirms that the composition of TPP (z to y) and NTPP (y to x) results in NTPP (z to x), so the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
