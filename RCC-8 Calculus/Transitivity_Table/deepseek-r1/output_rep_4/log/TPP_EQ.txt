PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z is determined as follows:  
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y, shares a boundary, and is not equal to y).  
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).  

Since y and z are identical, substituting z for y in TPP(x,y) directly yields TPP(x,z).  
- Thus, x must be a tangential proper part of z.  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- **DC**, **EC**, **PO**, **NTPP**, **TPPi**, **NTPPi**, or **EQ** would contradict TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).  

Therefore, the only possible relationship is TPP(x,z).  

### Answer:  
TPP(x,z)
