PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x without touching the boundary).
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), the relation between x and z must be the same as the relation between x and y. From NTPPi(x,y), we have NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, z is also a non-tangential proper part of x, which is expressed as NTPP(z,x).

However, the RCC-8 relations are defined from the perspective of the first argument. The relation NTPP(z,x) corresponds to NTPPi(x,z) because NTPPi is the inverse of NTPP.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
