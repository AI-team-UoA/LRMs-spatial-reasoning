PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The possible relationships between \(x\) and \(z\) given \(\text{PO}(x,y)\) and \(\text{PO}(y,z)\) encompass all eight RCC-8 relations. This is because the composition of partial overlap (PO) with itself yields every relation in the calculus, as verified by the RCC-8 composition table. Here are the relations:

- \(\text{DC}(x,z)\): Disconnected  
- \(\text{EC}(x,z)\): Externally connected  
- \(\text{PO}(x,z)\): Partially overlapping  
- \(\text{EQ}(x,z)\): Equal  
- \(\text{TPP}(x,z)\): Tangential proper part of \(z\)  
- \(\text{NTPP}(x,z)\): Non-tangential proper part of \(z\)  
- \(\text{TPPi}(x,z)\): Inverse of TPP (i.e., \(z\) is a tangential proper part of \(x\))  
- \(\text{NTPPi}(x,z)\): Inverse of NTPP (i.e., \(z\) is a non-tangential proper part of \(x\))  

Thus, all relations are possible.

### Answer:
