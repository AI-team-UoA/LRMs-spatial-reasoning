PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is entirely within y and touches y's boundary. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither being part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected if x is in a part of y that does not overlap with z and they do not touch.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected if x touches y's boundary at a point where z also touches but does not share interior parts with x.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap if x is partially within the overlap region of y and z but not entirely contained in z.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Relations such as EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because:
- EQ(x,z) would require x and z to be coincident, but x is a proper part of y and z is not fully contained in y or vice versa, leading to inconsistency.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is a proper part of x, but since x is a proper part of y and z extends outside y, z cannot be contained within x.

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
