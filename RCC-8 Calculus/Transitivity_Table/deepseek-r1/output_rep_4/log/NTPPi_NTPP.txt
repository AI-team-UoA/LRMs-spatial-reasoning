PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z using the RCC-8 composition table:

- NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

The composition of NTPP⁻¹ (i.e., NTPPi) and NTPP yields the following possible relations between x and z:  
- **PO(x,z)**: Partial overlap; they share parts but neither is part of the other.  
- **EQ(x,z)**: Equal; x and z are coincident.  
- **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part; x is a tangential proper part of z.  
- **TPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of TPP; z is a tangential proper part of x.  
- **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part; x is a non-tangential proper part of z.  
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: Inverse of NTPP; z is a non-tangential proper part of x.  

These cover all possibilities, as confirmed by the RCC-8 composition rules. Relations like DC, EC are impossible due to shared parts via y.

### Answer: PO, EQ, TPP, TPPi, NTPP, NTPPi
