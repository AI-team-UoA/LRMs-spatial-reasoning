PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of the RCC-8 relations. The composition PO â—¦ EC results in the following possible relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi.

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).

The relation EQ(x,z) is not possible because PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) imply that x and z cannot be coincident.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi
