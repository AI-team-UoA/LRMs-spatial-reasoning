PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are derived from the constraints and definitions of the RCC-8 relations.

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, so z is part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Both x and z are parts of y, but x touches y's boundary while z does not. This leads to the following possibilities for the relation between x and z:

1. **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This occurs if z is positioned deep within y's interior and x is on the boundary without overlap or contact.
2. **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This happens if z is adjacent to x but does not overlap, and the contact point is not on y's boundary.
3. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is part of the other. This is possible if z overlaps with the interior portion of x.
4. **TPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is part of x and touches x's boundary, but not y's boundary (since z must not touch y's boundary).
5. **NTPPi(x,z)**: Equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This occurs if z is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary, while also not touching y's boundary.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), EQ(x,z), TPPi(y,z), NTPPi(y,z), etc., are not possible because:
- If x were part of z, it would imply that x does not touch y's boundary (since NTPP(z,y) prevents z from touching y's boundary), contradicting TPP(x,y).
- x and z cannot be equal (EQ) because x touches y's boundary and z does not.
- Other relations like TPPi(y,z) or NTPPi(y,z) are not between x and z.

Thus, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
