PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and DC(y,z), the relation between x and z must be determined.  

- TPP(x,y) implies that x is a proper part of y, sharing a boundary but not the entire boundary. Thus, every point of x is within y.  
- DC(y,z) implies that y and z are disconnected, sharing no points.  

Since x is entirely within y and y shares no points with z, x must also share no points with z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC (disconnected).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- EC is excluded because x and z cannot touch (as y separates them).  
- PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ would imply shared points, contradicting DC(y,z).  

Thus, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).  

### Answer: DC(x,z)
