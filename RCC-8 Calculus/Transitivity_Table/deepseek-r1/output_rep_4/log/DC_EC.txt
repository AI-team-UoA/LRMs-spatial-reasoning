PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the composition of these relations in the RCC-8 calculus. The constraints imply that x and y share no parts, while y and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. The possible relations between x and z are:

- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected and share no parts. This is possible if x is positioned away from z, despite y and z touching.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. This can occur if x touches z at a point not involving y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z share some spatial parts but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x overlaps with z without interacting with y.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., x is part of z and touches z's boundary). This can happen if x is inside z and touches the boundary, while y touches z externally at a different location.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (i.e., x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary). This is possible if x is fully inside z, not touching the boundary, and y touches z externally.

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible:
- TPPi(x,z) (equivalent to TPP(z,x)) or NTPPi(x,z) (equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) would mean z is part of x, but then EC(y,z) implies y touches x, contradicting DC(x,y).
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are coincident, but then EC(y,z) implies a connection between y and x, contradicting DC(x,y).

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP for x and z.

### Answer:  
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
