PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):  
- NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.  
- NTPP(y,z) means y is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.  

Therefore, x must be entirely contained within z (since x ⊂ y ⊂ z). Additionally, x cannot touch z's boundary because:  
- x does not touch y's boundary, and y does not touch z's boundary.  
- If x touched z's boundary, it would imply y touches z's boundary (contradicting NTPP(y,z)).  

This rules out TPP(x,z) (which requires touching the boundary). It also rules out EQ(x,z) (since x and z are not equal), DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) (as these imply no containment or inverse containment).  

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).  

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
