PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the possible relations between x and z:

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is inside y and shares a boundary point with y.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z: y is entirely contained within the interior of z, with no boundary contact.

Since y is entirely in the interior of z (due to NTPP(y,z)), and x is inside y (due to TPP(x,y)), x must also be inside z. Specifically:
- x is a proper part of z.
- The boundary contact of x with y occurs within the interior of z (as y has no boundary contact with z). Thus, x does not touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z), meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
- DC, EC: x and z overlap (x is inside z).
- PO: x is a proper part of z, not partially overlapping.
- TPP: requires boundary contact with z, but x is interior to z.
- TPPi, NTPPi: imply z is part of x, but x is inside z.
- EQ: x and z are not equal (x is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of z).

Thus, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
