PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we analyze the relations:

- EQ(x,y) implies x and y are identical regions (coincident).
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is entirely inside z without touching its boundary).

Since x and y are identical, the relation between x and z is the same as that between y and z. Therefore, NTPP(y,z) directly implies NTPP(x,z). No other RCC-8 relations are possible because:

- DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ would contradict the given NTPP relation when substituting x for y (due to identity).
- For example, EQ(x,z) would require EQ(y,z), but NTPP(y,z) precludes EQ (they are distinct). TPP(x,z) would require touching the boundary, but NTPP specifies non-tangential (no boundary contact).

Thus, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
