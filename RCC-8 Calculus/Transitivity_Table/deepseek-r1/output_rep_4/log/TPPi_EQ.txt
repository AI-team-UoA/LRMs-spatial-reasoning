PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary).
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), the relationship between x and z must be the same as between x and y. Thus, TPP(y,x) implies TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
