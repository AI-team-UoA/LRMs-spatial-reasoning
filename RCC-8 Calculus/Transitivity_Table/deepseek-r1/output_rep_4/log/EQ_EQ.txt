PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The relations EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) imply that x, y, and z are all spatially coincident. Therefore, by transitivity of the EQ relation, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
