PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPPi(x,y), which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is entirely inside x and does not touch x's boundary). Also, DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: z is entirely outside x, so no overlap with x or y (which is inside x).
- **EC(x,z)**: z touches x's boundary but their interiors are disjoint; since y is entirely inside x and not near the boundary, it remains disconnected from z.
- **PO(x,z)**: z partially overlaps x but avoids y; this is possible because y is a proper part of x, leaving room in x for overlap without intersecting y.
- **TPPi(x,z)**: equivalent to TPP(z,x), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). Since y is disconnected from z and inside x, this is allowed.
- **NTPPi(x,z)**: equivalent to NTPP(z,x), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x without touching the boundary). Again, y and z are disconnected.

Other relations are impossible:
- **EQ(x,z)**: would imply y is inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **TPP(x,z)**: would imply x is inside z, so y (inside x) is inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: same issue as TPP(x,z).

Thus, the possible relationships are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

### Answer:
DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
