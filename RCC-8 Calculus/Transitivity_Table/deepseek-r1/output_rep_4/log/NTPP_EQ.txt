PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).  

- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary).  
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (identical regions).  
- Since y and z are identical, x must be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary, leading to NTPP(x,z).  

No other RCC-8 relations are possible:  
- DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are excluded because x is strictly inside z without touching its boundary, and z cannot be part of x or overlap partially.  

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
