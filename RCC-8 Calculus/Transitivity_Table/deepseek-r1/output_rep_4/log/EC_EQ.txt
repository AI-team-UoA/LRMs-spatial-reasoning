PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are coincident (i.e., identical regions). Therefore, any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Since EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected (they touch at a boundary but share no interior parts), this relationship directly transfers to x and z. Thus, the only possible relationship is EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)
