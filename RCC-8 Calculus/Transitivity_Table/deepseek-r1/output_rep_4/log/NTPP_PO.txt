PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the relative positions of the regions. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, it is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary. Since y and z partially overlap, they share some interior parts but neither is a part of the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected if x is located entirely within the part of y that does not overlap with z and there is no contact between x and z.
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected if x is not within z but touches z's boundary at a point, which can occur near the internal boundary of the overlap within y.
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap if x straddles the boundary between the overlapping and non-overlapping parts of y and z, sharing some interior parts but neither being a part of the other.
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and touches z's boundary.
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within the overlapping region of y and z and does not touch z's boundary.

Relations such as EQ(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because x is a proper part of y, while z is not fully contained within y, and the sizes and containments do not allow for equality or z being a part of x.

### Answer:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
