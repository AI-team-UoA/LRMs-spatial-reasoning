PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).  
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y, not touching y's boundary).  
- NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is entirely inside y, not touching y's boundary).  

Both x and z are non-tangential proper parts of y, so they are entirely contained within y's interior. The possible relationships between x and z are all eight RCC-8 relations, as there are no restrictions that eliminate any relation:  
1. **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected (no shared parts).  
2. **EC(x,z)**: x and z are externally connected (touch at a boundary but no shared interior).  
3. **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap (share some interior, but neither is part of the other).  
4. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary).  
5. **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary).  
6. **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z without touching z's boundary).  
7. **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x without touching x's boundary).  
8. **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are coincident (equal).  

This is consistent with the RCC-8 composition table, where the composition of NTPP and NTPP⁻¹ (i.e., NTPPi) yields all possible relations.
