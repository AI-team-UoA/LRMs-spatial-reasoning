PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are determined by the constraints of the RCC-8 calculus.  

- **DC(x,y)**: x and y are disconnected (no shared points).  
- **PO(y,z)**: y and z partially overlap (share interior points but neither is a part of the other).  

The possible relations between x and z are:  
1. **DC(x,z)**: Disconnected. Since x and y are disconnected, and y overlaps z, x could be entirely outside z.  
2. **EC(x,z)**: Externally connected. x may touch the boundary of z without sharing interior points.  
3. **PO(x,z)**: Partially overlapping. x may share interior points with z, but only in the part of z not overlapping y (since x and y are disconnected).  
4. **TPP(x,z)**: Tangential proper part. x could be a proper part of z, touching z's boundary.  
5. **NTPP(x,z)**: Non-tangential proper part. x could be a proper part of z, not touching z's boundary.  

The relations **TPPi(x,z)**, **NTPPi(x,z)**, and **EQ(x,z)** are impossible:  
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)** would imply z is a proper part of x, but then y and z overlapping would force x and y to share points, contradicting DC(x,y).  
- **EQ(x,z)** would make x and z identical, but then DC(x,y) would contradict PO(y,z) (since z must overlap y).  

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.  

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
