PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given the relations NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we analyze the possible spatial relationships between x and z. Here, NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is entirely inside y and does not touch y's boundary). TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is entirely inside y and touches y's boundary).

Both x and z are proper parts of y, but their relative positions can vary:
- **DC(x,z)**: x and z are disconnected. Possible if x and z are separated within y (e.g., x in the interior, z near the boundary, no contact).
- **EC(x,z)**: x and z touch externally but share no interior. Possible if x and z are adjacent but do not overlap (e.g., x touches z at a boundary point).
- **PO(x,z)**: x and z partially overlap. Possible if they share some interior parts but neither is a proper part of the other (e.g., x overlaps with part of z).
- **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. Possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary (e.g., x near z's internal boundary).
- **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Possible if x is entirely inside z and does not touch z's boundary (e.g., x in the interior of z).

However, the following are impossible:
- **TPPi(x,z)** or **NTPPi(x,z)**: This would imply z is a proper part of x. But z touches y's boundary, while x does not; if z were inside x, x would inherit contact with y's boundary, contradicting NTPP(x,y).
- **EQ(x,z)**: x and z cannot be equal, as x avoids y's boundary while z touches it.

Thus, the possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
