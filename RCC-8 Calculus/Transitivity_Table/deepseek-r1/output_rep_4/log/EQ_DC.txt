PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given that EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (i.e., identical spatial regions), and DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (i.e., no shared parts or contact), the relationship between x and z must also be disconnected. This is because x is identical to y, so any spatial relation involving y directly applies to x. Specifically, since y is disconnected from z, x must be disconnected from z. No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as they would imply some form of contact or overlap, contradicting DC(y,z).
