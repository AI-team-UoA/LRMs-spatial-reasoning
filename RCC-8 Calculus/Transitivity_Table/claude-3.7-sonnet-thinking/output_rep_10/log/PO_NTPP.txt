PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this question step-by-step.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, meaning they share some spatial part, but neither is entirely part of the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

We need to find the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Let's consider each possible relationship and see if it's consistent with the given information:

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   If x and z are disconnected, then they share no spatial parts. But we know that x shares some spatial part with y, and y is completely inside z. This means x must share some spatial part with z as well, contradicting DC(x,z). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Is it possible that x externally connects with z?
   If x and z externally connect, they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But we know that x partially overlaps with y, which means x and y share interior points, and y is completely inside z. This means that x shares interior points with z, contradicting EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Is it possible that x partially overlaps z?
   If x partially overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, then x must share some spatial part with z. But x might also have parts outside of z, making PO(x,z) a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   TPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x partially overlaps with y (which is inside z), and the remaining part of x is also inside z, with some part of x touching the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x partially overlaps with y (which is inside z), and the remaining part of x is also inside z, without touching the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y is completely inside z, and y partially overlaps with x, meaning some part of y is outside of x. This contradicts the idea that z is completely inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. As with TPPi, this contradicts the fact that y is completely inside z but partially overlaps with x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   EQ(x,z) means x and z occupy the same space. But if y is completely inside z, and x partially overlaps with y, then x and z cannot occupy the same space. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me think about this again more carefully:

First, if PO(x,y), then x and y share some spatial part, but neither is a subset of the other. This means some part of x is not in y, and some part of y is not in x.

Second, if NTPP(y,z), then y is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - If x and z are disconnected, they share no spatial parts. But since x shares a part with y, and y is completely inside z, x must share a part with z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - If x and z externally connect, they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But since x shares interior points with y, and y is completely inside z, x must share interior points with z. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - This is possible. x shares a part with z (through y), but some part of x might be outside of z, and z definitely has parts that are not in x (since y is not equal to z, and not all of y is in x).

4. TPP(x,z) - This is possible if all of x is inside z, and some part of x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - This is possible if all of x is inside z, and no part of x touches the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But y is completely inside z, and since not all of y is inside x (due to PO(x,y)), not all of z can be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. As with TPPi, this contradicts the fact that y is completely inside z but partially overlaps with x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - This would mean x and z are the same spatial region. But if y is completely inside z, and x partially overlaps with y, then x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I notice I'm a bit unsure about TPP(x,z). Let's think through it once more. For TPP(x,z) to be true, all of x must be inside z, and some part of x must touch the boundary of z. Since y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z (due to NTPP(y,z)), and some part of x is inside y (due to PO(x,y)), we need to determine if the remaining part of x (which is not in y) can touch the boundary of z.

Given PO(x,y), some part of x is not in y. This part of x could be inside z (in which case TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) would be true) or outside z (in which case PO(x,z) would be true). If this part of x touches the boundary of z from the inside, then TPP(x,z) would be true. If it's entirely inside z without touching the boundary, then NTPP(x,z) would be true. If some of it is outside z, then PO(x,z) would be true.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I believe my analysis is correct, but let me re-assess:

Given:
- PO(x, y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is entirely part of the other.
- NTPP(y, z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

For x and z:

1. DC(x, z): Not possible because x shares a part with y, which is inside z.
2. EC(x, z): Not possible because x shares interior points with y, which is inside z.
3. PO(x, z): Possible if some part of x is outside z, while the part that overlaps with y is inside z.
4. TPP(x, z): Possible if all of x is inside z, and some part of x touches the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x, z): Possible if all of x is inside z, and no part of x touches the boundary of z.
6. TPPi(x, z): Not possible because y is inside z, and y shares a part with x, so z can't be entirely inside x.
7. NTPPi(x, z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x, z): Not possible because PO(x, y) and NTPP(y, z) together imply that x and z are not identical.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)

OK, let's try one more time. I want to be extremely clear in my reasoning.

Given:
1. PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap, which means they share some spatial part but neither is a part of the other. In other words, x ∩ y ≠ ∅, x - y ≠ ∅, and y - x ≠ ∅.
2. NTPP(y, z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. In other words, y ⊂ z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let's examine each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): If x and z are disconnected, then x ∩ z = ∅. But we know PO(x, y), which means x ∩ y ≠ ∅. And NTPP(y, z), which means y ⊂ z. Together, these imply x ∩ z ≠ ∅. So, DC(x, z) is not possible.

2. EC(x, z): If x and z externally connect, then they touch at their boundaries but x ∩ interior(z) = ∅. But we know PO(x, y), which means x ∩ y ≠ ∅, and this overlap is in the interior of both x and y. And NTPP(y, z), which means y is in the interior of z. Together, these imply x ∩ interior(z) ≠ ∅. So, EC(x, z) is not possible.

3. PO(x, z): For PO(x, z) to be true, we need x ∩ z ≠ ∅, x - z ≠ ∅, and z - x ≠ ∅.
   - x ∩ z ≠ ∅: This is satisfied because PO(x, y) and NTPP(y, z) together imply x ∩ z ≠ ∅.
   - x - z ≠ ∅: This is possible if some part of x is outside z. Given PO(x, y), we know that not all of x is inside y. The part of x that's outside y could be outside z as well.
   - z - x ≠ ∅: Given NTPP(y, z), we know that z is strictly larger than y. And given PO(x, y), we know that x doesn't fully contain y. So, there's a part of z (derived from the parts of y that are not in x, and the parts of z that are not in y) that is not in x.
   Therefore, PO(x, z) is possible.

4. TPP(x, z): For TPP(x, z) to be true, we need x ⊂ z, and x touches the boundary of z.
   - x ⊂ z: This is possible if all of x is inside z. Given PO(x, y), we know that x and y share a part, but not all of x is inside y. The part of x that's outside y could still be inside z.
   - x touches the boundary of z: This is possible if the part of x that's outside y reaches the boundary of z.
   Therefore, TPP(x, z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x, z): For NTPP(x, z) to be true, we need x ⊂ z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - x ⊂ z: As discussed for TPP, this is possible.
   - x doesn't touch the boundary of z: This is possible if the part of x that's outside y is still well inside z, not reaching the boundary.
   Therefore, NTPP(x, z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x, z): For TPPi(x, z) to be true, we need z ⊂ x, and z touches the boundary of x.
   - z ⊂ x: This means all of z is inside x. But we know NTPP(y, z), which means y is inside z. And we know PO(x, y), which means there's a part of y that's not in x. So, there's a part of z (derived from the part of y that's not in x) that's not in x. Therefore, z ⊄ x.
   Therefore, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): For NTPPi(x, z) to be true, we need z ⊂ x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
   - z ⊂ x: As discussed for TPPi, this is not possible.
   Therefore, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): For EQ(x, z) to be true, we need x = z.
   - But if x = z, then given NTPP(y, z), we would have NTPP(y, x). This contradicts PO(x, y), which states that y is not a part of x.
   Therefore, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)

In summary, if PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze the implications of PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some space, but neither is contained in the other)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, x must share some space with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. The overlap between x and y occurs in their interiors, and since y is inside z's interior, x must share interior points with z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x shares space with z (through y), but some part of x could extend outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside z and partially outside x, z cannot be contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be NTPP to x, contradicting PO(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
