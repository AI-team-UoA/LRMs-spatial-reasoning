PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step-by-step.

We're given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

We need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same spatial region. They have the same interior and the same boundary.

Since TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. 

Given that x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), and y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), we can conclude that x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

This is because:
1. x occupies exactly the same region as y (due to EQ(x,y))
2. y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary (due to TPP(y,z))
3. Therefore, x must also be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by considering what each of these relations means:

- EQ(x,y): x and y occupy exactly the same space
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z (completely contained within z) and touches z's boundary

Since x and y occupy exactly the same space, and y is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary, x must also be a proper part of z that touches z's boundary.

Therefore, TPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

Actually, I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me check each of the 8 RCC-8 relations to see if any other relation could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This can't be true because y is part of z, and x equals y, so x must be connected to z.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This can't be true because y shares interior parts with z (as y is part of z), and x equals y.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This can't be true because y is a proper part of z (fully contained in z), and x equals y, so x must also be fully contained in z, not partially overlapping.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, and x equals y, this relation is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Since TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary, and x equals y, x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since y is a proper part of z, and x equals y, it's not possible for z to be a part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, since y is a proper part of z, and x equals y, it's not possible for z to be a part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. This can't be true because y is a proper part of z, and x equals y, so x can't equal z.

So, after checking all 8 relations, I confirm that TPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z given the conditions EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me just double-check the relation TPP to make sure I'm understanding it correctly:

TPP(y,z) means that y is a "tangential proper part" of z, which means:
1. y is a proper part of z (all of y is contained in z, but y â‰  z)
2. y touches the boundary of z

If x is coincident with y (EQ(x,y)), then x must have exactly the same relation to z as y does, which is TPP.

So the answer is:

TPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship(s) could exist between x and z based on the given conditions.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is contained within z and touches z's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same spatial region - they have identical interiors and boundaries.

Since TPP(y,z), y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Therefore, if x is coincident with y, and y is a tangential proper part of z that touches z's boundary, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z that touches z's boundary.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
