PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step about what NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) tell us.

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a non-tangential proper part of y
- x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary

NTPP(y,z) means:
- y is a non-tangential proper part of z
- y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary

So we have:
- x is completely inside y
- y is completely inside z

From this, we can deduce that x must be completely inside z. But what specific RCC-8 relation holds between x and z?

Since x is inside y and y is inside z, we know that x must be inside z. So x is definitely a proper part of z. The question is whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

Given that x doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(x,y)), and y doesn't touch the boundary of z (from NTPP(y,z)), it means that x is completely surrounded by y, which is itself completely surrounded by z. This means that x cannot touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me double-check this by considering the definitions more carefully.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

So x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary. And y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. 

Can x touch z's boundary? Since x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, there's a "buffer zone" between x and the boundary of z (namely, the space between the boundary of y and the boundary of z). So x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this from a set-theoretic perspective to be completely sure.

If we think about regions as sets of points:
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper subset of y, and the closure of x is a subset of the interior of y.
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper subset of z, and the closure of y is a subset of the interior of z.

From these:
1. x is a proper subset of y, which is a proper subset of z. So x is a proper subset of z by transitivity of the subset relation.
2. The closure of x is a subset of the interior of y, and the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z. So the closure of x is a subset of the interior of z.

These two conditions together define NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is that the relation between x and z is definitely NTPP(x,z).

Actually wait, I think I'm being too hasty here. Let me go through the definitions carefully again.

For NTPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
For NTPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

From these, we can deduce:
1. x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x is a proper part of z.
2. x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, for the relation between x and z, we need to determine if x touches z's boundary.

Since x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), it means there is a "buffer zone" between x and z's boundary. This ensures that x does not touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I believe my reasoning is correct this time. So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relation must hold between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

From these conditions:
1. x is completely contained within y
2. y is completely contained within z
3. Neither x touches y's boundary nor y touches z's boundary

This means x is completely contained within z with a "buffer zone" (at least the thickness of y) between x and z's boundary. Since x cannot touch z's boundary, the only possible relation is:

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
