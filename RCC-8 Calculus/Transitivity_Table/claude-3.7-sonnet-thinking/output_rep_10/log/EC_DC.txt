PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step-by-step.

We're told that:
- EC(x,y) - x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- DC(y,z) - y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

The possible relationships must be one or more of the eight RCC-8 relations:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident

Given that EC(x,y), x and y are touching at their boundaries. Since DC(y,z), y and z are completely disconnected.

Let's consider what this means for the relationship between x and z:

Since y and z are disconnected (DC), there is some spatial separation between them. And since x is only touching y at the boundary (EC), x does not extend into the region where z is located.

However, it's still possible that x and z could have various relationships:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z could be completely disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - x and z could be touching at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z) - x and z could partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z) - x could be a tangential proper part of z
5. TPPi(x,z) - z could be a tangential proper part of x

I don't think NTPP(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) are possible because:
- If x were non-tangentially inside z, it would mean x is completely surrounded by z, which would likely make it impossible for x to externally connect with y while y is disconnected from z
- Similarly, if z were non-tangentially inside x, it would be difficult for y to be externally connected to x while being disconnected from z

Let me verify if EQ(x,z) is possible:
If x and z were equal (coincident), then since y is externally connected to x, y would also be externally connected to z. But we're told that y is disconnected from z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me check each of the remaining possibilities more carefully.

**DC(x,z)**:
This is definitely possible. x touches y, y is disconnected from z, and x could also be disconnected from z.

**EC(x,z)**:
This is possible too. x and z could be touching at their boundaries at a different location from where x touches y.

**PO(x,z)**:
I think this is possible. x could partially overlap with z in a region that doesn't include the part where x touches y.

**TPP(x,z)**:
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z but touching z's boundary. Since y touches x at the boundary and y is disconnected from z, this creates a contradiction. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches x at the boundary, then y would have to at least touch z as well. But since DC(y,z), this is not possible. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

**TPPi(x,z)**:
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would be completely inside x but touching x's boundary. Since y touches x at the boundary and y is disconnected from z, z cannot be at the same boundary where y touches x. But z could be at a different part of x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me reconsider NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) to be sure:

**NTPP(x,z)**:
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y would have to penetrate into z to reach x. But since DC(y,z), this is not possible. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

**NTPPi(x,z)**:
If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then since y touches x at the boundary and y is disconnected from z, this arrangement is possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me double-check TPPi(x,z) again:
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to touch x's boundary. If y also touches x's boundary (since EC(x,y)), and DC(y,z), then z cannot be touching the same part of x's boundary as y. But it could be touching a different part. So TPPi(x,z) remains possible.

Actually, let me reconsider my reasoning for TPP(x,z):

For TPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z but touching z's boundary. If y touches x's boundary (EC(x,y)), and x touches z's boundary, then y would at least need to touch z's boundary as well. But since DC(y,z), this creates a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I need to be more careful about the geometry here. Let's reconsider all cases systematically:

**DC(x,z)**:
Clearly possible. x touches y, y is disconnected from z, and x can also be disconnected from z.

**EC(x,z)**:
Also possible. x can touch z at a different location than where it touches y.

**PO(x,z)**:
This is possible too. x can partially overlap with z while still having a part of its boundary touch y, which is disconnected from z.

Now for the part-whole relationships:

**TPP(x,z)**:
For this to be true, x must be completely inside z but touching z's boundary. Also, EC(x,y) means y touches x's boundary. The question is: can y touch x's boundary while being completely disconnected from z? 

If x touches z's boundary at a point, and y touches x at the same point, then y would also touch z, contradicting DC(y,z). But what if x touches z's boundary at one point, and y touches x's boundary at a completely different point? In this case, y could still be disconnected from z.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible if the point where x touches z's boundary is different from the point where y touches x.

**NTPP(x,z)**:
For this to be true, x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But then for EC(x,y) to be true, y would have to penetrate into z to touch x, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

**TPPi(x,z)**:
Here, z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. If y touches x at a different part of x's boundary than z does, then y and z can remain disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

**NTPPi(x,z)**:
Here, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Since y only touches x's boundary (EC(x,y)), y and z can remain disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

**EQ(x,z)**:
If x and z are identical, and EC(x,y), then we would also have EC(z,y), contradicting DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to reconsider my logic for TPP(x,z). I said it's possible if x touches z's boundary at a point different from where y touches x. But if x is completely inside z (as required by TPP), then any point on x's boundary is either inside z or on z's boundary. If y touches x at any such point, y would either be inside z or touching z, both of which contradict DC(y,z).

So TPP(x,z) is actually not possible.

In summary, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But I want to double-check TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) to make sure I'm reasoning correctly.

For TPPi(x,z), z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y touches x's boundary at a point different from where z touches it, then y and z can remain disconnected. This seems possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Since y only touches x's boundary (EC(x,y)), y and z can remain disconnected. This also seems possible.

So my final answer stands: the possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me review this one more time for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. If y also touches x's boundary (since EC(x,y)), we need to ensure y and z remain disconnected (since DC(y,z)). This is possible if z touches x's boundary at a location different from where y touches x. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is properly contained in x and does not touch x's boundary. Since y only touches x at the boundary (EC(x,y)), and z is completely inside x without touching its boundary, y and z can remain disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

To summarize, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But wait, let me double check EC(x,z) again:

For EC(x,z), x and z touch at their boundaries but do not share interior parts. We also know that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z). This means y touches x's boundary but is completely disconnected from z.

Is it possible for x to touch z at their boundaries while y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z at all? I think it is, as long as x touches z at a different part of its boundary than where it touches y.

So EC(x,z) remains a possibility.

Let's also check PO(x,z) again:

For PO(x,z), x and z share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other. We also know that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z). This means y touches x's boundary but is completely disconnected from z.

Is it possible for x to partially overlap with z while y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z at all? Yes, as long as the part of x's boundary that y touches is not in the region where x overlaps with z.

So PO(x,z) remains a possibility.

So, my final answer stands: the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Given information:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- DC(y,z): y and z are completely disconnected

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Definitely possible. x can touch y at one boundary while being completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at a different part.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z while still having a boundary part that touches y but not z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were inside z touching z's boundary, then y would have to either penetrate z or touch z to reach x, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were completely inside z without touching its boundary, y would have to penetrate z to touch x, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x touching x's boundary at a different location than where y touches x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while y only touches x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then EC(x,y) would mean EC(z,y), contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
