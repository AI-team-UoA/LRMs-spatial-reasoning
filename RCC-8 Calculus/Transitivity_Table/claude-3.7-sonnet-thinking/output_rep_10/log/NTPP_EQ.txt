PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We are given:
- NTPP(x,y) - which means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary
- EQ(y,z) - which means that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. 

Since EQ(y,z), this means that y and z are identical in terms of their spatial extent. In other words, y and z have the same interior and the same boundary.

Since NTPP(x,y), this means that x is completely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

Since z is identical to y (due to EQ(y,z)), and x is completely contained within y without touching its boundary, it follows that x must also be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

To double-check: 
- Can it be DC(x,z)? No, because x is inside y, and y is coincident with z, so x cannot be disconnected from z.
- Can it be EC(x,z)? No, because x doesn't touch y's boundary, and since y and z share the same boundary, x cannot touch z's boundary either.
- Can it be PO(x,z)? No, because x is entirely contained within y, and y is coincident with z, so x must be entirely contained within z as well.
- Can it be TPP(x,z)? No, because NTPP(x,y) means x doesn't touch y's boundary, and since y and z share the same boundary, x cannot touch z's boundary either. TPP would require x to touch z's boundary.
- Can it be NTPP(x,z)? Yes, as we deduced above.
- Can it be TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)? No, these would mean that z is part of x, but we know that x is part of y, and y is coincident with z, so z cannot be part of x.
- Can it be EQ(x,z)? No, because NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, not equal to y, and since y and z are coincident, x cannot be equal to z.

So, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

To further verify our answer, I'll use the composition table for RCC-8 relations. According to the composition of NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the result should be NTPP(x,z). This confirms our reasoning.

Actually, I realize that the composition table isn't necessary here. The definition of EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical in terms of spatial relations. So any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z when EQ(y,z). Since NTPP(x,y), it must be the case that NTPP(x,z) as well.

So, the final answer is: NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what happens when we combine these two spatial relationships.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are spatially identical (same interior and same boundary), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP), and y is identical to z, then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
