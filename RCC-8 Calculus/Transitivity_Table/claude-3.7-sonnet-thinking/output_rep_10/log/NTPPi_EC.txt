PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this question carefully. We have two given relations:
1. NTPPi(x,y): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and does not touch the boundary of x.
2. EC(y,z): This means that y and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now we need to figure out the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's think about it in terms of the spatial arrangement:
- y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- z touches y at its boundary

Given these constraints, what are the possible arrangements of x and z?

First, let's note that since y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y at its boundary, z must at least reach inside x to touch y.

So what are the possibilities?

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But this is impossible because z touches y, which is inside x, so z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if z reaches exactly to the inside of x to touch y, without going any further into x.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z extends both inside and outside of x, while touching y inside x.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z completely contains x and x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z completely contains x and x does not touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x completely contains z and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, it cannot touch y which is also inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. This is impossible because z touches y, which is inside x, so z and x cannot be identical.

Hmm, let me re-think this carefully.

We have:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This seems impossible because if z touches y, and y is inside x, then z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if z reaches just to the boundary of x, and from there extends inward to touch y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is definitely possible. z could overlap with part of x, and the overlapping region includes or touches y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z, touching z's boundary. This seems possible. If z is large enough to contain all of x, and x touches the boundary of z, this would satisfy the conditions.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This is also possible if z completely contains x with some space in between.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x, touching x's boundary. This is possible if z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and also touches y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This seems impossible because if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is also completely inside x not touching x's boundary, it's not clear how z could touch y's boundary. Actually, I need to think more about this...

If y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y at its boundary, then z must extend from y's boundary outward. But since y is not touching x's boundary, z doesn't have to reach x's boundary. So it's actually possible for z to be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, thus NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. This seems impossible because y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y at its boundary. If x and z were identical, then z would also have y completely inside it, not touching its boundary, which contradicts EC(y,z).

Wait, let me review this again. I think I made a mistake in my reasoning about NTPPi(x,z).

We have:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. But if z is touching y, and y is inside x, then z must extend from y outward. But it doesn't necessarily have to reach x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Actually, let me reconsider all of these again, I'm not being precise enough. I'll draw some pictures and really think about this.

We have:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries.

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z share no points. But since z touches y, and y is inside x, z must at least share some points with x. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if z reaches from the outside of x, just to the boundary of x, and from there connects to y inside x. Wait, this doesn't make sense. If z is outside x and only touches x at its boundary, it can't also touch y which is strictly inside x. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z overlaps with part of x, and the overlapping region includes or touches y.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z completely contains x, and x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z completely contains x with some space in between.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and also extends inward to touch y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. As I was saying before, if z is inside x (not touching x's boundary) and extends inward to touch y, this would be possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. This is impossible because y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y at its boundary. If x and z were identical, then z would also have y completely inside it, not touching its boundary, which contradicts EC(y,z).

I still think there's a flaw in my reasoning. Let me try a different approach.

Let's try to place these regions in a 2D plane and see what's possible.

1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a small region completely inside a larger region x, not touching x's boundary. Visualize y as a small circle inside a larger circle x, with some space between the boundaries.

2. EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries. Visualize z as another region that touches the small circle y at its boundary.

Now, what are the possible arrangements of z relative to x? Let's enumerate the possibilities.

Since y is completely inside x, and z touches y at its boundary, z must at least extend into x. But how far does z extend? There are several possibilities:

1. z could be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This would make NTPPi(x,z) true.

2. z could be inside x but touching x's boundary. This would make TPPi(x,z) true.

3. z could extend beyond x, partially overlapping with x. This would make PO(x,z) true.

4. z could completely contain x, with x touching z's boundary. This would make TPP(x,z) true.

5. z could completely contain x, with x not touching z's boundary. This would make NTPP(x,z) true.

Let's check the other relations:

6. DC(x,z): This is impossible because z touches y, which is inside x, so z must at least touch x.

7. EC(x,z): This is impossible because if z only touches x at its boundary, it can't also touch y which is strictly inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): This is impossible because if x and z are identical, z cannot touch y at its boundary because y is strictly inside x.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think about EC(x,z) again. If z touches x at its boundary, can it also touch y inside x? For this to be true, z would have to somehow extend into x to touch y. But if z extends into x, then z and x share some interior points, which contradicts the definition of EC. So EC(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Actually, now I'm doubting my conclusion about NTPPi(x,z). If z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, and y is also completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, then both y and z are "floating" inside x. If y and z touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), then they're like two adjacent bubbles inside x. This is certainly possible, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, the more I think about it, the more I'm not sure if TPPi(x,z) is possible. Let me clarify this. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely inside x and must touch x's boundary. But z also has to touch y, which is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This means z has to extend from x's boundary to y. Given that y is not touching x's boundary, there's a gap between y and the boundary of x. So z would have to be a region that extends from the boundary of x, across this gap, to touch y. This is certainly possible, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me triple check that the relation TPP(x,z) is correct. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and must touch z's boundary. But we know that y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, and z touches y at its boundary. This means that z touches a region (y) that is strictly inside x, which means z must extend inside x. But if x is completely inside z, this is not a problem. So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me also triple check that the relation NTPP(x,z) is correct. For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and must not touch z's boundary. We know that y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, and z touches y at its boundary. This means that z touches a region (y) that is strictly inside x, which means z must extend inside x. But if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, this is not a problem. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

To sum up, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to double check these answers by considering the problem more carefully. The problem states:

1. NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
2. EC(y,z): This means y and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.

Let's carefully analyze what these mean for the relation between x and z:

1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
2. EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.

Now, let's consider the constraints these place on the relation between x and z:

- The fact that y is completely inside x and z touches y means that z must extend into x.
- The fact that y doesn't touch the boundary of x means there's some "buffer zone" inside x around y.

Let's reconsider each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because z must extend into x to touch y, which is inside x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is impossible because z must extend into x to touch y, which means x and z must overlap.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z extends into x to touch y, but also extends outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z completely contains x and x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z completely contains x and x does not touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x completely contains z and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x completely contains z and z does not touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. This is impossible because y is completely inside x and z touches y, so z cannot be identical to x.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I realize that I may have been wrong above about EC(x,z). Let me reason through it one more time.

If EC(x,z) is true, then x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap. This means that z can't extend into the interior of x. But we know that z touches y at its boundary, and y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary). For z to touch y, z would have to extend into the interior of x, which contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is indeed impossible.

So, to sum up, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's analyze what we know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap

Now I'll consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible. Since z touches y, which is inside x, z must at least extend into x.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible. If z only touched x at the boundary, it couldn't also touch y which is strictly inside x.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. z can partially overlap with x, extending both inside x (to touch y) and outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x while touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary (like a "bubble" next to y).

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x and z were identical, z couldn't touch y at its boundary since y is strictly inside x.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
