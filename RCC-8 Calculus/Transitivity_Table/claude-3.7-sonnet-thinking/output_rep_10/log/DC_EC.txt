PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze the given relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts

I need to find which of the 8 RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) can possibly hold between x and z given these constraints.

Let's think about what we know:
- x and y don't share any parts and are completely separate
- y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap

Given this information, what can we say about x and z?

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, this is possible. If x and y are disconnected, and y and z only touch at their boundaries, it's certainly possible that x and z have no connection at all.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at their boundaries? Yes, this is possible. If x and y are disconnected, but x happens to touch z at a boundary point or region that is different from where y touches z, then x and z could be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, this is possible. Even though x and y are disconnected, and y and z only touch at boundaries, x could still overlap with parts of z that are far from y.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, this is possible. x could be completely inside z and touching z's boundary at a location distant from where y touches z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, this is possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary at all.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, this is possible. z could be completely inside x and touching x's boundary at a location distant from y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, this is possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? Yes, this is possible. If x and z are the same region, and y is disconnected from x but touches z (which is the same as x) at a boundary, this would be consistent with our constraints.

Wait, let me recheck my reasoning, particularly for the last few cases. I need to ensure consistency with both DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z), if z is a tangential proper part of x, that means z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. But we also know that y touches z at its boundary (from EC(y,z)) and is disconnected from x (from DC(x,y)). This creates a contradiction: if y touches z at z's boundary, and z's boundary is part of x's boundary (since z is tangential to x), then y would touch x at its boundary, contradicting DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (which touches z at its boundary) would have to reach inside x to touch z. This would mean y and x share some spatial part, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same region, then y touching z at its boundary (EC(y,z)) would mean y touches x at its boundary, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me recheck TPP(x,z) as well. If x is a tangential proper part of z, x touches z's boundary. We also know y touches z's boundary (from EC(y,z)) and is disconnected from x (from DC(x,y)). This is possible if x and y touch different parts of z's boundary, with no overlap between x and y.

And NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y touches z at its boundary, this is consistent with y being disconnected from x.

Let me reconsider PO(x,z) too. If x and z partially overlap, some part of x is outside of z. If y touches z at its boundary and is disconnected from x, this requires that y touches z at a part of z's boundary that is far from any part of x, which is possible.

So the possible relations between x and z given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, I'm still not completely confident about my reasoning for some of these. Let me try a more systematic approach.

DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected. Let's call the regions occupied by x, y, and z as Rx, Ry, and Rz respectively. DC(x,y) means Rx and Ry have no points in common, not even boundary points.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. So Ry and Rz share some boundary points but no interior points.

Now, what are the possible relationships between Rx and Rz?

1. DC(x,z): Rx and Rz have no points in common. This is certainly possible. Imagine Rx and Rz are two separate regions, and Ry is a third region that touches Rz at its boundary but is completely separate from Rx.

2. EC(x,z): Rx and Rz share some boundary points but no interior points. This is also possible. Imagine Rx and Rz touch at some boundary points, and Ry is separate from Rx but touches Rz at different boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): Rx and Rz partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if the overlap between Rx and Rz does not include any part of Ry, and Ry touches Rz at a boundary point outside this overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Rx is a tangential proper part of Rz, meaning Rx is contained in Rz and touches Rz's boundary. This is possible if Ry touches Rz at a boundary point far from Rx, ensuring Ry and Rx remain disconnected.

5. NTPP(x,z): Rx is a non-tangential proper part of Rz, meaning Rx is completely contained within Rz without touching Rz's boundary. This is possible if Ry touches Rz at its boundary, keeping Ry disconnected from Rx which is deep inside Rz.

6. TPPi(x,z): Rz is a tangential proper part of Rx. If Rz is inside Rx and touches Rx's boundary, and Ry touches Rz at Rz's boundary, then Ry would touch or overlap with Rx, contradicting DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Rz is a non-tangential proper part of Rx. If Rz is completely inside Rx without touching Rx's boundary, and Ry touches Rz at Rz's boundary, then Ry would have to penetrate into Rx to touch Rz, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Rx and Rz are identical. If Rx and Rz are the same, and Ry touches Rz at its boundary, then Ry would also touch Rx at its boundary, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for the TPP(x,z) case. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If y touches z at z's boundary (EC(y,z)) and is disconnected from x (DC(x,y)), we need to make sure these conditions don't contradict. It's possible that y touches z at a part of z's boundary that is far from where x touches z's boundary, ensuring y and x remain disconnected.

Let me try to visualize it once more. If I have three regions:
- Rx (region x) is inside Rz and touches Rz's boundary at some point p1
- Ry (region y) touches Rz's boundary at some point p2
- p1 and p2 are different points on Rz's boundary, far enough that Rx and Ry don't overlap or touch

This configuration satisfies TPP(x,z), EC(y,z), and DC(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

Similar reasoning applies to PO(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) - both are possible as long as we ensure that the constraints DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are satisfied.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me double-check this list by considering each relation one more time.

DC(x,z): Possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at their boundaries, and x and z can be disconnected.

EC(x,z): Possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at their boundaries, and x and z can touch at their boundaries without contradicting the other relations.

PO(x,z): Possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at their boundaries, and x and z can partially overlap without contradicting the other relations.

TPP(x,z): Possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at their boundaries, and x can be a tangential proper part of z without contradicting the other relations.

NTPP(x,z): Possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at their boundaries, and x can be a non-tangential proper part of z without contradicting the other relations.

TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would have to touch or overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would have to penetrate into x to touch z, contradicting DC(x,y).

EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are identical, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would touch x at its boundary, contradicting DC(x,y).

So, my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be completely disconnected from z while y touches z's boundary.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z's boundary at a different location than where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z in areas away from where y touches z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary at points distant from where y touches z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were a tangential proper part of x, then y touching z at its boundary would mean y must touch or penetrate x, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were completely inside x, then y would have to penetrate x to touch z, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y touching z would mean y touches x, contradicting DC(x,y).
