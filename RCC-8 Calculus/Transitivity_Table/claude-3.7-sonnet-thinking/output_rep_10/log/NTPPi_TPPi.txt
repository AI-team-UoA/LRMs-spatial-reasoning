PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's use the definitions of NTPPi and TPPi to understand what relationships we have.

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary. In other words, NTPP(y,x).

- TPPi(y,z) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary. In other words, TPP(z,y).

So we have:
- NTPP(y,x), which means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now I need to determine what these two facts tell us about the relationship between x and z.

From NTPP(y,x), we know that y is properly contained within x, with no boundary contact.
From TPP(z,y), we know that z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is contained within y, and y is contained within x, we know that z must be contained within x by transitivity. But what kind of containment?

If z touches y's boundary, does it necessarily touch x's boundary? Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is contained within y, z cannot touch x's boundary either. Therefore, z must be properly contained within x without touching its boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me rethink this more carefully. The fact that z touches y's boundary doesn't necessarily tell us about z's relationship with x's boundary.

Let's go through each of the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z and see which ones are consistent with what we know:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know z is contained within y, and y is contained within x. So z must be contained within x, ruling out DC.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. But z is contained within y, which is properly contained within x. So z cannot touch x's boundary, ruling out EC.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since z is contained within y, and y is properly contained within x, z must be properly contained within x as well, ruling out PO.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But we know y is a proper part of x, and z is a proper part of y. So z must be a proper part of x, not the other way around, ruling out TPP.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, we know that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. This implies z is a proper part of x, not the other way around, ruling out NTPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z touches x's boundary. But wait - y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is contained within y. So z can't touch x's boundary either, ruling out TPPi.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that z is contained within y, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z must also not touch x's boundary. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, making NTPPi(x,z) a consistent relationship.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. But since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, z must be a proper part of x as well, not equal to it. This rules out EQ.

I'm a bit hesitant about my analysis of TPPi. Let me reconsider.

TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z would need to touch x's boundary. But we know y is completely contained within x (NTPP(y,x)), meaning y doesn't touch x's boundary. And z is contained within y (TPP(z,y)). 

If z touches y's boundary, can it also touch x's boundary? Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is contained within y, z cannot reach x's boundary. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, from the above analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, let me reconsider this once more. I think I might have made a mistake.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

The key question is: if z touches y's boundary, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must be inside x. Now, does z touch x's boundary? No, because y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y. Therefore, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

However, I'm not completely sure. Let me verify by drawing a mental image.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z as an even smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary.

In this setup, z is clearly completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary, which confirms NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me triple-check this. I'm overthinking.

We have:
- NTPP(y,x): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- TPP(z,y): z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Transitivity tells us that z is inside x. And since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, z cannot touch x's boundary. So z is inside x, not touching x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I think my answer is correct: the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

On fourth thought, let me go back to the original definitions.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that y is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means that z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's reason about the relationship between x and z.

Since y is completely contained within x, and z is completely contained within y, then z is completely contained within x. That means that either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

For TPP(z,x) to be true, z would need to touch x's boundary. However, since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is contained within y, z cannot touch x's boundary either. Therefore, TPP(z,x) is not possible.

This leaves NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z), as the only possible relationship.

Actually, no, I'm making a mistake. Let me rethink this from scratch.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is non-tangentially properly contained within x.
- TPPi(y,z): z is tangentially properly contained within y.

That means:
- y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, z must be inside x by transitivity. But does z touch x's boundary? No, it can't because y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y. Since z doesn't touch x's boundary, it must be non-tangentially properly contained within x, giving us NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

I think the answer is clear: the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I'm confused about this. Let me double-check.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Does this mean that z is inside y, or y is inside z? Let me reread the definitions.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is tangentially properly contained within y. So z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So, z is inside y, and y is inside x. By transitivity, z is inside x.

Now, does z touch x's boundary? Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, z cannot touch x's boundary either. Therefore, z is non-tangentially properly contained within x, giving us NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

For the final time to check, here's my understanding:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means:
- y is a proper part of x (contained within x).
- y does not touch x's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means:
- z is a proper part of y (contained within y).
- z touches y's boundary.

So:
- y is inside x, not touching its boundary.
- z is inside y, touching its boundary.

By transitivity, z is inside x.
Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, z cannot touch x's boundary.
Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I'm sure the correct answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let me revisit the definitions:

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's consider the relationship between x and z:

We know that y is properly contained within x without touching its boundary, and z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary. This means z is also properly contained within x (by transitivity of containment).

The question is whether z touches x's boundary. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is contained within y, z cannot reach x's boundary. Therefore, z is properly contained within x without touching its boundary, which makes the relationship NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reread the definition of TPPi more carefully. The problem statement said: "TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)". 

This means TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

I was right before: z is inside y (touching y's boundary), and y is inside x (not touching x's boundary). This means z is inside x, but z doesn't touch x's boundary because y doesn't. Hence, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I feel like I should double-check this. The problem statement says "There may be more than one possible relation, in which case name all of the possible answers." Let me just check again to see if there's any possibility other than NTPPi for the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Let's consider the possible RCC-8 relations for (x,z):

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Impossible because z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z is inside x.
2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Impossible for the same reason.
3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Impossible because z is entirely inside x.
4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: Impossible because x contains y, which contains z.
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Impossible for the same reason.
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This would mean z touches x's boundary. But y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, so z can't touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is consistent with what we know. z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are the same: Impossible because z is inside y, which is inside x, so z is properly inside x.

So, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to revisit the possibility of TPPi(x,z). This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z touches x's boundary.

But if y is a non-tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y, can z touch x's boundary?

Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, z can't extend beyond y to touch x's boundary. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

Actually, I think I need to be very careful about the spatial configurations allowed by these axioms. Let's define more precisely:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's carefully consider the possible configurations. If y doesn't touch x's boundary, can z, which is inside y and touches y's boundary, somehow touch x's boundary?

I think not. y is completely contained within x, without touching x's boundary. This means there's a "buffer zone" inside x, around y. Since z is inside y, even if it touches y's boundary, it's still inside this buffer zone, so it can't touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I think I can be confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me be super careful and do one final check. If y is inside x, not touching x's boundary, and z is inside y, touching y's boundary, then z is definitely inside x. The question is whether z can touch x's boundary.

For z to touch x's boundary, it would need to extend beyond y, since y doesn't touch x's boundary. But since TPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y, z cannot extend beyond y. Therefore, z cannot touch x's boundary.

So, z is properly contained within x without touching its boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

The answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, what I want to visualize is the following:

- x is a big circle.
- y is a smaller circle entirely within x, not touching x's boundary.
- z is an even smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary.

In this visualization, z is clearly entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This confirms NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I'm very confident that the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realized that I should double-check whether there's another way to interpret TPPi. Let's go back to the definition:

"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary.

This is consistent with my understanding, and I'm confident that the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

In conclusion, if NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me do one final check on this. I want to make sure I haven't missed any possibilities.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Impossible because z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z is inside x.
2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Impossible for the same reason.
3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Impossible because z is entirely inside x.
4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: Impossible because x contains y, which contains z, so x cannot be a proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Impossible for the same reason.
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: Impossible because y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, so z can't touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: Possible. z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are the same: Impossible because z is inside y, which is inside x, so z cannot be the same as x.

So, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm trying to be super careful, and I realized the fact that z touches y's boundary implies an even stronger constraint. It means that z cannot touch anything outside of y. In particular, if y doesn't touch x's boundary, then z certainly cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Acutally, I need to be even more careful. Let me reconsider this: 

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is properly contained within x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is properly contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Does TPP(z,y) mean that the entirety of z's boundary touches y's boundary, or just a part of it? I'm pretty sure it's the latter. TPP(z,y) means that z is a proper part of y, and there's at least some part of z's boundary that touches y's boundary.

So, z could be touching y's boundary at some points, but not all of z's boundary needs to be in contact with y's boundary.

With this understanding, can z touch x's boundary? Again, since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is contained within y, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I've checked this multiple times, and I'm confident that the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, one more thing for completeness. I should make sure about the nature of these regions. The RCC-8 relations typically apply to regions, which can have arbitrary shapes.

So, x, y, and z are regions, not necessarily circles. But the principles remain the same:

- y is contained within x without touching x's boundary.
- z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

By the definition of "contained within", z must be inside x. And since y doesn't touch x's boundary, z, being contained within y, cannot touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, making the relationship NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

The answer is definitely NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary (equivalent to NTPP(y,x))
- TPPi(y,z): This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary (equivalent to TPP(z,y))

Let me analyze what this means for the relationship between x and z:
1. Since y is completely inside x, and z is inside y, by transitivity z must be inside x
2. Does z touch x's boundary? Since y doesn't touch x's boundary (by NTPPi(x,y)), and z is fully contained within y, z cannot reach x's boundary
3. Therefore, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary

This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is defined as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
