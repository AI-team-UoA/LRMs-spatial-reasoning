PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary.

So we have:
- x touches y at the boundary.
- z is contained within y, not touching y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since z is contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, it seems like x and z cannot touch each other. 

Given that x and z don't touch, they must be disconnected, which corresponds to the DC relation.

So the answer should be DC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by considering the spatial arrangements more carefully:

- x and y touch at their boundaries (EC)
- z is completely contained within y, away from y's boundary (NTPPi)

Given this arrangement, x and z cannot share any points because z is strictly inside y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary. So x and z are disconnected, which is DC(x,z).

Wait, I need to be more careful about the definitions:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- x touches y at the boundary.
- z is contained within y, not touching y's boundary.

Since z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot overlap or touch. They must be disconnected, which is DC(x,z).

Ah, I think I made a mistake. Let me revisit the definition of NTPPi(y,z). This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Actually, I think I'm still confusing myself. Let's clarify:

- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary.
- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

So we have:
- z is properly contained in y, away from y's boundary.
- x touches y at the boundary.

Given this arrangement, x and z cannot share any points because z is strictly inside y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary. So x and z are disconnected, which is DC(x,z).

Wait, let me see if I can sketch this out to make it clearer for myself. 

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is properly contained in z, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, we have:
- x touches y at the boundary.
- y is properly contained in z, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given this, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is properly contained in z, and x touches y at the boundary, x might also touch z at the boundary. Alternatively, x might be properly contained in z, or x and z might overlap.

Let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This seems possible if x only touches y at a small part of y's boundary, and the rest of x is outside of z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is also a part of z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z overlap. This is possible if part of x is inside z, and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is contained in z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This doesn't seem possible because x touches y at the boundary, and y is contained in z, so x must also touch z's boundary if it's contained in z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This doesn't seem possible because y is contained in z, and x only touches y at the boundary, so z cannot be fully contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This doesn't seem possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This doesn't seem possible because x only touches y at the boundary, while y is properly contained in z.

Ok wait. I think I'm still making a mistake in understanding NTPPi(y,z). Let me reread the definition carefully.

NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is properly contained in y, away from y's boundary.

Given this, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is properly contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot share any points. So the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me sketch this out to make sure:

- We have three regions: x, y, and z.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is properly contained in y, away from y's boundary.

So, y contains z without z touching y's boundary. And x touches y at the boundary. Since z is away from y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z are disconnected.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

OK, I was overthinking this. I'm going to be very precise with my definitions now:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior points.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is fully contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.
- z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary (and doesn't overlap with y), it's clear that x and z cannot share any points. So the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I'm going to reconsider my understanding of NTPPi(y,z) one more time. The clue says: "NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y)."

NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

But the relation we're given is NTPPi(y,z), which is the inverse of NTPP, so it means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Oh wait, there's a direct definition for NTPPi: "NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)." So NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y).

Let's be super clear:
- NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b. a is inside b and doesn't touch b's boundary.
- NTPPi(a,b) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a. b is inside a and doesn't touch a's boundary.

So NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, with that cleared up:
- EC(x,y): x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given this arrangement, it's clear that x and z cannot share any points, because z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary. So the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually I think I'm still mixing things up. Let me be very explicit: Given NTPPi(y,z), what is the relationship between y and z?

If NTPPi(y,z), then z is fully contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

No, that's incorrect. Let's go back to the provided definitions:

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary."

"NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

So the relationship is: z is a proper part of y, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- EC(x,y): x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given this, it's clear that x and z cannot share any points, because z is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary. So the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

I think I've been making this too complicated. Let's simplify and be precise.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given this, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is fully contained within z, and x touches y at the boundary, x might also touch z at the boundary. Alternatively, x might be fully contained within z, or x and z might overlap.

Let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This seems unlikely because y is contained in z, and x touches y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is strictly inside z, but x doesn't overlap with z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z overlap. This is possible if part of x is inside z, and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This doesn't seem possible because y is contained in z, and x only touches y at the boundary, so z cannot be fully contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This doesn't seem possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This doesn't seem possible because x only touches y at the boundary, while y is properly contained in z.

OK but let me check. We have the following information:
- NTPPi(y,z) means that y is inside z, not touching z's boundary.
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at the boundary, but share no interior.

So now I need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z. 

Case 1: DC(x,z).
Let's imagine a small region y inside a larger region z, but not touching z's boundary. Now, add a region x that touches y's boundary, but is otherwise disjoint from y. Could x be disjoint from z? If x is disjoint from z, then x can't overlap with z. But y is inside z, and x touches y. So x and z must share at least one point (the point where x touches y). So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Case 2: EC(x,z).
For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at a boundary but not overlap. Given that y is inside z, and x touches y at the boundary, x might touch z at the boundary as well. This seems possible if x touches y at a part of y's boundary, and the rest of x is outside z, only touching z at a boundary.

Actually, wait. I need to be more careful about my reasoning. The fact that y is inside z means that any point on y's boundary is also inside z (not on z's boundary). So if x touches y at the boundary, x must also overlap with z. So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me reconsider this. If NTPPi(y,z), then y is contained in z, and y doesn't touch z's boundary. This means that y, including its boundary, is fully inside z. If EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. Since y's boundary is inside z, x touches a part of z as well. In fact, any part of x that touches y is also inside z. This means that x overlaps with z to some extent.

So, x and z cannot be disconnected (DC) or merely touch at the boundary (EC). They must overlap.

Now, let's consider the other possibilities:

3. PO(x,z): x and z overlap. This is possible if part of x is inside z, and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This doesn't seem possible because y is contained in z, and x only touches y at the boundary, so z cannot be fully contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This doesn't seem possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This doesn't seem possible because x only touches y at the boundary, while y is properly contained in z.

OK, I'm beginning to think that the only possible relationships are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z). Let me double-check my reasoning.

Actually, let me reason more carefully about each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. If y is inside z, and x touches y, then x and z cannot be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. If y is inside z, and x touches y at the boundary, then x overlaps with z to some extent. So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z overlap. This is possible if part of x is inside z, and part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. If y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, then z cannot be fully contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For the same reason as TPPi, this is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check my reasoning, though:

For EC(x,y), x and y touch at the boundary but don't overlap. For NTPPi(y,z), y is inside z, away from z's boundary. Given these conditions, could x be fully inside z (TPP or NTPP)?

If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, then part of x is inside z. For x to be fully inside z (TPP or NTPP), the entirety of x would need to be inside z. It's possible for x to be fully inside z, but it's also possible for part of x to be outside z. So both PO and TPP/NTPP seem possible.

Specifically, if x is small and just touches y at a point, then x could be fully inside z (TPP or NTPP). But if x is larger and extends outside of z, then x and z would partially overlap (PO).

To distinguish between TPP and NTPP, we need to determine if x can touch z's boundary. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z). If x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z). Given the conditions, both seem possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

Let me check this for a few concrete cases. I'll imagine a circular region y inside a circular region z, with y not touching z's boundary.
1. If x is a small circle that touches y at a point, but is otherwise outside of y, then a portion of x is inside z, and a portion is outside. This gives PO(x,z).
2. If x is a larger circle that engulfs y and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z).
3. If x is a circle inside z that touches y at a point but doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm not sure if case 2 is valid, given EC(x,y). Let me revisit this.

For EC(x,y), x and y touch at the boundary but don't overlap. This means x can't engulf y. So the only possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me revisit this again. A circle x can touch another circle y at a point (EC(x,y)) and still be completely inside a larger circle z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)).

Let's reconsider from the beginning. We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is inside z, away from z's boundary.

Since y is inside z, any part of x that touches y must also be inside z. If x is fully inside z, then TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z). If part of x extends outside of z, then PO(x,z).

Can x be fully inside z and still touch z's boundary (TPP(x,z))? Yes, if x is positioned in such a way that it touches y at one point and z's boundary at another.

Can x be fully inside z and not touch z's boundary (NTPP(x,z))? Yes, if x is small enough and positioned in such a way that it only touches y and doesn't reach z's boundary.

Can part of x be inside z and part be outside (PO(x,z))? Yes, if x is large enough to extend beyond z while still touching y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

Actually, we can be more clever about the TPP(x,z) case. TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that y is inside z, away from z's boundary, and x touches y at the boundary, can x also touch z's boundary?

Well, for x to touch z's boundary, x would need to be large enough to extend from y to z's boundary. But if x is that large, it might not be fully contained in z. So TPP(x,z) might not be a possible relationship.

Actually, let's consider a concrete case. Imagine a circular region y inside a circular region z, with y not touching z's boundary. Now, imagine a circular region x that touches y at a point. If x is positioned in such a way that it touches y at one point and z's boundary at another, and the entirety of x is inside z, then TPP(x,z).

Let me try to visualize this more clearly:
z is the largest circle.
y is a smaller circle inside z, not touching z's boundary.
x is another circle that touches y at a point.

If x is small and only touches y at a point, then x is fully inside z, but doesn't touch z's boundary. This gives NTPP(x,z).

If x is larger and touches both y at a point and z's boundary at another point, and the entirety of x is inside z, then TPP(x,z).

If x is even larger and extends beyond z, while still touching y at a point, then part of x is inside z, and part is outside. This gives PO(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let's provide a simpler reasoning:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is inside z, away from z's boundary.

So, y is properly inside z, and x touches y at the boundary. This means that x touches a point inside z. 

Now, x can extend in various ways:
1. It can extend outside of z, resulting in PO(x,z).
2. It can be fully inside z and touch z's boundary, resulting in TPP(x,z).
3. It can be fully inside z but not touch z's boundary, resulting in NTPP(x,z).

Since we're not given any other constraints, all three of these scenarios are possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me try a slightly different approach to see if the possible relationships can be further narrowed down:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is inside z, away from z's boundary.

Since y is inside z, any part of x that touches y is also inside z. Now, let's consider what it means for x and y to be EC. It means they touch at the boundary but don't overlap. So, x can't be inside y (otherwise, they'd overlap). This means x can't be fully inside z unless it's positioned in a very specific way.

Let's consider the possible relationships one by one:

1. DC(x,z): This isn't possible because x touches y, which is inside z, so x must touch z as well.

2. EC(x,z): This isn't possible because touching y, which is inside z, means x overlaps with z to some extent.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if part of x is inside z (the part that touches y) and part is outside.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, it's hard to imagine how z could be fully contained in x. So this doesn't seem possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For the same reasons as TPPi, this doesn't seem possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal. Given the constraints, this doesn't seem possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I've been overcomplicating this. Let me provide a clearer reasoning:

- EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't overlap.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is inside z, away from z's boundary.

Given that y is inside z, and x touches y, there are three possibilities for x:
1. Part of x is inside z, and part is outside. This gives PO(x,z).
2. x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. This gives TPP(x,z).
3. x is fully inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This gives NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

(I'm no longer considering the other possibilities because they've been ruled out.)

So, the answer is: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check: can we rule out any of these possibilities or would all three be possible?

One approach is to see if we can construct concrete examples for all these cases.

1. PO(x,z):
Imagine a small square y inside a large square z, not touching z's boundary. Now, imagine a long rectangular strip x that touches y at one corner, but extends far beyond z. In this case, x partially overlaps with z. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z):
Imagine a small square y inside a large square z, not touching z's boundary. Now, imagine a rectangular strip x that touches y at one corner and z at one of its boundaries, but is entirely inside z. In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z):
Imagine a small square y inside a large square z, not touching z's boundary. Now, imagine a small square x that touches y at one corner, but is entirely inside z, and doesn't touch z's boundary. In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, all three relationships are possible.

Let me come up with a visual representation to make this clearer. Let's denote regions as sets of points:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   - y = {(a,b) : 4 <= a <= 6, 4 <= b <= 6}
   - z = {(a,b) : 3 <= a <= 7, 3 <= b <= 7}
   - x = {(a,b) : 5 <= a <= 8, 5 <= b <= 8}
   In this case, x touches y at the point (6,6), part of x is inside z, and part is outside. So, PO(x,z).

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - y = {(a,b) : 4 <= a <= 6, 4 <= b <= 6}
   - z = {(a,b) : 3 <= a <= 7, 3 <= b <= 7}
   - x = {(a,b) : 6 <= a <= 7, 6 <= b <= 7}
   In this case, x touches y at the point (6,6), and x is fully inside z, touching z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z).

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - y = {(a,b) : 4 <= a <= 6, 4 <= b <= 6}
   - z = {(a,b) : 3 <= a <= 7, 3 <= b <= 7}
   - x = {(a,b) : 5 <= a <= 6, 5 <= b <= 6}
   In this case, x touches y at multiple points along the boundary, and x is fully inside z, not touching z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, my example for NTPP(x,z) above isn't quite correct, because in this example x not only touches y at the boundary but also overlaps with y. Let me try again:

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - y = {(a,b) : 4 <= a <= 6, 4 <= b <= 6}
   - z = {(a,b) : 3 <= a <= 7, 3 <= b <= 7}
   - x = {(a,b) : 6 <= a <= 6.5, 6 <= b <= 6.5}
   In this case, x touches y at the point (6,6), and x is fully inside z, not touching z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

So the answers is: PO, TPP, NTPP.

wait

I just realized we don't have the same understanding of the words. For me, "inside" means "contained in the interior". So if y is inside z, then y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let me restate clearly:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP. So it means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is properly contained in z, and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given these, we want to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Since y is properly contained in z, and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y at the boundary, we need to figure out how x relates to z.

Specifically, the question is: if EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

We have the relationships:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
2. NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given this, and based on my previous analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (neither is contained in the other).
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is contained in z and touches z's boundary).
3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is contained in z, but doesn't touch z's boundary).

So, the answer is: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me understand what these conditions mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (meaning y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary)

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is completely inside z (away from z's boundary), and x touches y at the boundary, x must interact with z in one of these ways:

1. PO(x,z): If x extends outside of z while touching y, then x partially overlaps with z.

2. TPP(x,z): If x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

3. NTPP(x,z): If x is completely contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

I can rule out other relationships:
- x can't be disconnected from z because it touches y, which is inside z
- x can't just touch z's boundary because it already overlaps with z (at points where it touches y)
- z can't be contained in x (TPPi/NTPPi) because y is inside z and x only touches y
- x and z can't be equal because y is properly inside z

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
