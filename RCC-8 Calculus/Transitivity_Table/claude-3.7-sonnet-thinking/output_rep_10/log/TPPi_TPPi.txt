PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through the relations and their meanings.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is part of x, y touches x's boundary, and y is not equal to x.

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is part of y, z touches y's boundary, and z is not equal to y.

So we have that:
- y is part of x (and touches x's boundary)
- z is part of y (and touches y's boundary)

From these, we can deduce that z is part of x by transitivity of the "part of" relation. But we need to determine more precisely which of the RCC-8 relations holds between x and z.

The possibilities for the relation between x and z are:
1. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z touches x's boundary.
2. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z does not touch x's boundary.
3. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This would mean x = z.

Let's rule out options:

EQ(x,z) would mean x = z, but we know that z is part of y and y is part of x, where both are proper parts (not equal). This implies that z is a proper part of x, so z cannot be equal to x. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's consider whether z can touch the boundary of x:

TPPi(x,y) means y touches the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means z touches the boundary of y.

The question is: if z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, must z touch the boundary of x?

Not necessarily. It's possible that z touches a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x. In this case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x, giving us NTPP(z,x).

However, it's also possible that z touches a part of y's boundary that coincides with the boundary of x. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x, giving us TPP(z,x).

So both TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) are possible.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the definition. TPPi(x,y) does not mean y is a tangential proper part of x, but rather x is a tangential proper part of y. Let me reconsider.

TPPi(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, which is the inverse of TPP(x,y). So it means that y contains x, x touches y's boundary, and x is not equal to y.

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So z contains y, y touches z's boundary, and y is not equal to z.

So we have:
- x is part of y (and touches y's boundary)
- y is part of z (and touches z's boundary)

From these, we can deduce that x is part of z by transitivity of the "part of" relation. But we need to determine more precisely which of the RCC-8 relations holds between x and z.

The possibilities for the relation between x and z are:
1. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x touches z's boundary.
2. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x does not touch z's boundary.
3. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This would mean x = z.

Let's rule out options:

EQ(x,z) would mean x = z, but we know that x is part of y and y is part of z, where both are proper parts (not equal). This implies that x is a proper part of z, so x cannot be equal to z. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's consider whether x can touch the boundary of z:

TPPi(x,y) means x touches the boundary of y.
TPPi(y,z) means y touches the boundary of z.

The question is: if x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, must x touch the boundary of z?

Not necessarily. It's possible that x touches a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z. In this case, x would be a non-tangential proper part of z, giving us NTPP(x,z).

However, it's also possible that x touches a part of y's boundary that coincides with the boundary of z. In this case, x would be a tangential proper part of z, giving us TPP(x,z).

Actually, I think there is an issue with the explanation I gave, because I'm not properly accounting for the "i" in TPPi, which indicates the inverse relation.

Let me start again with the correct definitions:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is part of x, y touches x's boundary, and y is not equal to x.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This implies that z is part of y, z touches y's boundary, and z is not equal to y.

So we have:
- y is part of x (and touches x's boundary)
- z is part of y (and touches y's boundary)

By transitivity, z is part of x. We need to determine whether z is a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x, or possibly equal to x.

Since z is a proper part of y (TPP(z,y)) and y is a proper part of x (TPP(y,x)), z must be a proper part of x. So z cannot be equal to x, ruling out EQ(x,z).

The question now is whether z touches the boundary of x. If it does, then TPP(z,x); if not, then NTPP(z,x).

Given that z touches the boundary of y (from TPP(z,y)) and y touches the boundary of x (from TPP(y,x)), there are two possibilities:
1. z touches the boundary of y at a point that also lies on the boundary of x. In this case, z would touch the boundary of x, giving us TPP(z,x).
2. z touches the boundary of y only at points that lie in the interior of x. In this case, z would not touch the boundary of x, giving us NTPP(z,x).

Both situations are geometrically possible, so both TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) are possible relations between x and z.

But TPP(z,x) is the same as TPPi(x,z), and NTPP(z,x) is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me just double-check this once more.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is part of x and y touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is part of y and z touches y's boundary.

By transitivity, z is part of x. 

If z touches the boundary of x, then TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z).

If z does not touch the boundary of x, then NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

Both of these cases are possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I'm confusing myself a bit. Let me try to understand the TPPi relation properly.

TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. The "i" stands for "inverse," and it's the inverse of TPP(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.

So TPPi(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (x is contained in y and is not equal to y)
- x touches the boundary of y

And TPPi(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z (y is contained in z and is not equal to z)
- y touches the boundary of z

From these, we can deduce that:
- x is a proper part of y
- y is a proper part of z
- Therefore, x is a proper part of z (by transitivity of the proper part relation)

Now, we need to determine if x touches the boundary of z:

If x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z).
If x does not touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z).

Given that x touches the boundary of y and y touches the boundary of z, it's possible that x touches the boundary of z (if x touches the part of y's boundary that also forms part of z's boundary). It's also possible that x only touches the part of y's boundary that is in the interior of z, in which case x would not touch the boundary of z.

Both situations are geometrically possible, so both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible relations between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

So I was indeed confusing myself. Let's make sure I have the definitions correct:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, which implies x is properly contained in y and x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). So TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, which implies y is properly contained in x and y touches the boundary of x.

Given these definitions:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

Thus:
- y is properly contained in x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is properly contained in y, and z touches the boundary of y.

By transitivity, z is properly contained in x. We need to determine if z touches the boundary of x. If it does, then TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z). If it doesn't, then NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

Given that z touches the boundary of y and y touches the boundary of x, there are two possibilities:
1. z touches the boundary of y at a point that also lies on the boundary of x. In this case, z would touch the boundary of x, giving us TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).
2. z touches the boundary of y only at points that lie in the interior of x. In this case, z would not touch the boundary of x, giving us NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Both situations are geometrically possible, so both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible relations between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think I've been overthinking this. Let me go back to the definitions.

We have these definitions:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which is the same as TPP(y,x).

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y.

This means:
- y is properly contained in x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is properly contained in y, and z touches the boundary of y.

By transitivity of the proper part relation, z is properly contained in x. But does z touch the boundary of x?

It could, if z touches the part of y's boundary that also forms part of x's boundary. In this case, the relation would be TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z).

But it might not, if z only touches parts of y's boundary that are in the interior of x. In this case, the relation would be NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are geometrically possible, so both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.

I'm being asked to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). Given that I've established that both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible, the answer is:

The possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me check this by considering concrete examples to make sure.

Example 1: Imagine three concentric circles, with circle x being the largest, circle y inside x, and circle z inside y. All circles touch, i.e., circle y touches the boundary of circle x, and circle z touches the boundary of circle y.

In this case, z would also touch the boundary of x, giving us TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z).

Example 2: Imagine a large circle x, a smaller circle y inside x and touching its boundary, and an even smaller circle z inside y but only touching a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

In this case, z would not touch the boundary of x, giving us NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is that given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

But I realize I've been flip-flopping between the definitions of TPP and TPPi, so let me double-check the definition once more:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is properly contained in y and x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is properly contained in x and y touches the boundary of x. This is the same as TPP(y,x).

Now, given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

We have:
- y is properly contained in x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is properly contained in y, and z touches the boundary of y.

By transitivity, z is properly contained in x. The question is whether z touches the boundary of x.

If z touches the boundary of x, then the relation is TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z).

If z does not touch the boundary of x, then the relation is NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, both scenarios are geometrically possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

But this still doesn't sound right. Let's make sure I'm thinking about this correctly.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. 
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

If y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y, then z is a proper part of x. 

We need to consider whether z is a tangential proper part of x (touches the boundary of x) or a non-tangential proper part of x (doesn't touch the boundary of x).

If z touches the boundary of y (which it does because z is a tangential proper part of y), and y touches the boundary of x (which it does because y is a tangential proper part of x), then it depends on whether the part of y's boundary that z touches coincides with the boundary of x. If it does, then z touches the boundary of x and the relation is TPP(z,x). If not, then z doesn't touch the boundary of x and the relation is NTPP(z,x).

Let's clarify:
- TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z.

But from our previous reasoning, we know that z is a proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations are:
- TPP(z,x), if z touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(z,x), if z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Both are geometrically possible given the constraints.

Wait, I got confused again. Let's go back to the basics:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is properly contained in y and x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), so TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

This means:
- y is properly contained in x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is properly contained in y, and z touches the boundary of y.

By transitivity, z is properly contained in x.

If z touches the boundary of x, then the relation is TPP(z,x).
If z does not touch the boundary of x, then the relation is NTPP(z,x).

Given the constraints, both scenarios are possible. Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

Ah, I see. I got confused by the naming. Let's convert them to the original RCC-8 relations.

TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is the relation we're considering.
TPPi(z,x) is the inverse, meaning x is a tangential proper part of z. But we know z is part of x, so this is not possible.

So, the possible relations are TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

Let's also double-check the original RCC-8 relations mentioned in the problem:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y): the same as TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y): the same as NTPP(y,x).
EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Given our reasoning, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z).
- NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, there's a mismatch in my reasoning. Let me correct:

TPPi(x,y) means the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(x,y) means the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

This means:
- y is properly contained in x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is properly contained in y, and z touches the boundary of y.

By transitivity, z is properly contained in x.

If z touches the boundary of x, then the relation is TPP(z,x).
If z does not touch the boundary of x, then the relation is NTPP(z,x).

Both scenarios are geometrically possible. Now, let's express these in terms of the original RCC-8 relations:

TPP(z,x) is one of the original relations and means z is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPP(z,x) is also one of the original relations and means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I think I'm still getting confused.

Let's see. This is one of the original relations:

TPPi(x,y): the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

So TPPi(x,y) means y is part of x and touches x's boundary. 

But TPP(y,x) means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

So I think there's a consistency. Let's check again:

TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y): the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

I think that's consistent. Now let's check the NTPP relations:

NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y): the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

I think that's also consistent. So given:

TPPi(x,y), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

We need to find the possible relationships between x and z. We know that z is part of y and y is part of x, so z is part of x by transitivity. But we need to determine if z touches the boundary of x.

If z touches the boundary of x, then the relation is TPP(z,x).
If z does not touch the boundary of x, then the relation is NTPP(z,x).

Both scenarios are possible. So the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

Wait, I'm still not fully confident. Let me just check one more time:

If we have TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

I know that:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

From these, I can deduce that z is part of x (by transitivity). But I need to determine if z touches x's boundary.

If z touches x's boundary, then the relation is TPP(z,x).
If z does not touch x's boundary, then the relation is NTPP(z,x).

Both scenarios are possible given the constraints.

Actually, I need to be more careful. We are reasoning about the relationship between x and z. So the final result should be in the form R(x,z), not R(z,x).

Given that z is part of x, the relationship between x and z could be TPPi(z,x) or NTPPi(z,x), depending on whether z touches x's boundary or not.

But TPPi(z,x) means the same as TPP(x,z), which means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. 

However, we know that z is part of x, so it's not possible for x to be part of z. So TPPi(z,x) is not a possible relationship.

Similarly, NTPPi(z,x) means the same as NTPP(x,z), which means x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. Again, since z is part of x, it's not possible for x to be part of z. So NTPPi(z,x) is not a possible relationship either.

I think I'm making things more complicated than they need to be. Let's approach this differently.

We know:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

The question asks for the relationship between x and z, i.e., R(x,z).

By transitivity, z is part of x. So the relationship between x and z is either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z), depending on whether z touches x's boundary or not.

TPPi(x,z) means z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(x,z) means z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Given that z touches y's boundary and y touches x's boundary, both scenarios are possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I'm confusing myself again. Let's be careful and get the definitions straight once more:

TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y): the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y): the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, the relationship between x and z, i.e., R(x,z), depends on how x and z are related spatially.

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z is also part of x (by transitivity). But the question is: does z touch x's boundary?

If z touches the boundary of x, then the relation is TPPi(x,z), which means the same as TPP(z,x).
If z does not touch the boundary of x, then the relation is NTPPi(x,z), which means the same as NTPP(z,x).

Both scenarios are possible given the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I see the problem. I'm getting confused because I was thinking of the relationship as R(z,x) instead of R(x,z).

Let me clearly define the relationships:

TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary. (This is the same as TPP(y,x).)
NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. (This is the same as NTPP(y,x).)

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

We know that z is part of y and y is part of x, so z is part of x by transitivity.

Now, we need to determine the relationship between x and z, i.e., R(x,z).

Since z is part of x, the relationship is either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z), depending on whether z touches x's boundary or not.

TPPi(x,z) means z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(x,z) means z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Given that z touches y's boundary and y touches x's boundary, both scenarios are possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

To double-check this:

TPPi(x,z) means z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(x,z) means z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Yes, both of these describe possible ways that x and z could be related, given that z is part of x.

Actually, I think there's been a misunderstanding all along. Let me restate the problem and the definitions:

We have these spatial relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

We need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

From the above, we can deduce that:
- y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- By transitivity, z is part of x.

So the question becomes: what is the specific relationship between x and z?

The possible relations that represent "z is part of x" in the RCC-8 calculus are:
- TPP(z,x): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(z,x): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(z,x): z and x are coincident.

Given that z is a proper part of y (from TPPi(y,z)) and y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), z must be a proper part of x. This rules out EQ(z,x).

So we're left with TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x). Both of these are possible, depending on whether z touches the boundary of x or not.

Given that z touches the boundary of y (from TPPi(y,z)) and y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), it's possible for z to touch the boundary of x (if the part of y's boundary that z touches also forms part of x's boundary). It's also possible for z not to touch the boundary of x (if the part of y's boundary that z touches lies entirely inside x).

Both scenarios are geometrically possible, so both TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) are possible relations between z and x.

Now, to express this in terms of the relationship between x and z, i.e., R(x,z), we need to convert TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) to equivalent relations where x is the first argument and z is the second.

TPP(z,x) is equivalent to TPPi(x,z) (by the definition of TPPi).
NTPP(z,x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z) (by the definition of NTPPi).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

I believe that this is the correct answer, and I've been flip-flopping due to over-complicating the problem and mixing up the order of the arguments. Let me double-check the logic:

We're given that:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

And we're asking for R(x,z), the possible relationships between x and z.

By transitivity, z is a proper part of x. But is z a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x?

If z touches the boundary of x, then z is a tangential proper part of x, and the relation is TPPi(x,z).

If z does not touch the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and the relation is NTPPi(x,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I may be making a mistake in the mapping from "z is a tangential proper part of x" to a relation in the form R(x,z). Let me double-check:

"z is a tangential proper part of x" corresponds to TPP(z,x), not TPPi(x,z). By the definition, TPPi(x,z) means "z is a tangential proper part of x", which is the same as TPP(z,x).

So, from our reasoning above, the possible relationships between z and x are TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x). To convert to relationships between x and z, we get TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Ok, let me get this right once and for all. To do so, I need to be crystal clear about the definitions of the relations.

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
- x is a proper part of y (x is contained in y and x ≠ y)
- x touches the boundary of y

TPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of TPP(x,y), so TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). This means:
- y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and y ≠ x)
- y touches the boundary of x

NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- x is a proper part of y (x is contained in y and x ≠ y)
- x does not touch the boundary of y

NTPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), so NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x). This means:
- y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and y ≠ x)
- y does not touch the boundary of x

Now, given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

We want to find the relationship between x and z. In particular, we want to know what R(x,z) is.

From the given conditions, we know:
- y is properly contained in x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is properly contained in y, and z touches the boundary of y.

By transitivity, z is properly contained in x. The question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not.

If z touches the boundary of x, then the relation is TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x).
If z does not touch the boundary of x, then the relation is NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x).

Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, both scenarios are geometrically possible. It's possible for z to touch the part of y's boundary that also forms part of x's boundary, in which case z would touch the boundary of x. It's also possible for z to touch only the part of y's boundary that lies in the interior of x, in which case z would not touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check by considering concrete examples:

Example 1: Imagine three concentric circles, with circle x being the largest, circle y inside x, and circle z inside y. All circles touch, i.e., circle y touches the boundary of circle x, and circle z touches the boundary of circle y at the same point where y touches the boundary of x.

In this case, TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) hold. Also, z touches the boundary of x, so the relation is TPPi(x,z).

Example 2: Imagine a large circle x, a smaller circle y inside x and touching its boundary, and an even smaller circle z inside y and touching y's boundary at a point that doesn't coincide with the boundary of x.

In this case, TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) hold. But z doesn't touch the boundary of x, so the relation is NTPPi(x,z).

These examples confirm that both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible, given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Great, so the final answer is:

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realized I may still have been confusing myself. Let me reason through this one more time, paying careful attention to the definitions and the question.

The RCC-8 relations are:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): the same as TPP(y,x). This means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y): the same as NTPP(y,x). This means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, i.e., R(x,z).

From the given conditions, we know:
- y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- z is contained in y and touches y's boundary.

By transitivity, z is contained in x. 

Given the RCC-8 relations, the possible relationships that represent "z is contained in x" are:
- TPP(z,x): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(z,x): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(z,x): z and x are coincident.

Since z is a proper part of y (from TPPi(y,z)) and y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), z must be a proper part of x. This rules out EQ(z,x).

So we're left with TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x). Both of these are possible, depending on whether z touches the boundary of x or not.

Now, the question asks for the relationship between x and z, i.e., R(x,z). We need to convert TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) to equivalent relations where x is the first argument and z is the second.

TPP(z,x) is equivalent to TPPi(x,z) (by the definition of TPPi).
NTPP(z,x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z) (by the definition of NTPPi).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Is TPPi(x,z) the same as TPP(z,x)? Let's check:

TPP(x,y) means x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), so TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

So TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is part of x and touches x's boundary.

Yes, TPPi(x,z) is the same as TPP(z,x). Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is the same as NTPP(z,x).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

I believe this is the correct answer, and it's consistent with my earlier reasoning and the examples I provided.

In conclusion, given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me analyze what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y (z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary)

By transitivity of the part-of relation, we know that z must be properly contained in x.

Now I need to determine whether z touches the boundary of x or not:

Case 1: If z touches y's boundary at a point that coincides with x's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary. In this case, the relation would be TPPi(x,z) (meaning z is a tangential proper part of x).

Case 2: If z only touches y's boundary at points that are in the interior of x, then z would not touch x's boundary. In this case, the relation would be NTPPi(x,z) (meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x).

Both cases are geometrically possible, so both relations are possible.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z)
