PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to reason through the possible relationships between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's analyze what we know:
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, which is equivalent to TPP(z,y). This means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's think about this step by step.

Given TPPi(y,z), we know that z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary. And given EC(x,y), we know that x touches y at a boundary but doesn't overlap with y's interior.

So what are the possible ways that x and z can relate?

1. x and z might be disconnected (DC): This is possible if z is contained in a part of y that is away from where x touches y.

2. x and z might be externally connected (EC): This could happen if z touches the boundary of y exactly where x touches y.

3. x and z might partially overlap (PO): This isn't possible because for x to overlap with z, x would have to share some interior part with y (since z is contained within y), but EC(x,y) says that x and y don't share interior parts.

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP): This isn't possible because for x to be a part of z, x would have to be a part of y (since z is a part of y), which contradicts EC(x,y).

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP): This isn't possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi): This seems possible if z is a small region that's part of y and touches y's boundary exactly where x touches y.

7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi): This doesn't seem possible because for z to be a non-tangential part of x, z would have to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But z touches y's boundary, and x only touches y at a boundary. So z would have to be inside x and also touch the boundary of y, which seems contradictory.

8. x and z could be equal (EQ): This isn't possible because for x to be equal to z, x would have to be a part of y (since z is a part of y), which contradicts EC(x,y).

Actually, let me re-examine 6 and 7 more carefully.

For TPPi(z,x), z would be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained within x and touches x's boundary. Given that z is a part of y and touches y's boundary, for z to be a part of x, x would have to overlap with y, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi isn't possible.

For NTPPi(z,x), z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. Again, for z to be a part of x, x would have to overlap with y, which contradicts EC(x,y). So NTPPi isn't possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning. Maybe I've missed something.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's use the composition table for RCC-8, which gives us the possible relations between x and z based on the relations between x and y, and y and z.

According to the composition table, for EC(x,y) ∘ TPPi(y,z) or EC(x,y) ∘ TPP(z,y), the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

I see I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine the case of PO(x,z).

For x and z to partially overlap, they need to share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other. Given that z is a part of y and touches y's boundary, it's possible for x to overlap with z if x touches y at the same part of the boundary as z. Then, x and z would share that boundary point, and x might extend further outside of y, while z extends into y. This would make x and z partially overlap.

And for TPPi(x,z), z would be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained within x and touches x's boundary. If z is at the boundary of y where x touches y, then it's possible for z to be a part of x, with x extending outside of y. This would make z a tangential proper part of x.

Actually, wait, I need to rethink this. Let's be more careful about the definitions:

- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, which is equivalent to TPP(z,y). This means that z is properly part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, for x and z to be in a PO relationship, they must share some interior points, but neither can be a part of the other. Given that z is properly part of y, and x does not share any interior with y (due to EC(x,y)), it's not possible for x and z to share any interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary. Again, since z is a part of y, and x does not share any interior with y, it's not possible for z to be a part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I seem to be getting confused with the interpretation of the RCC-8 composition table. Let me do more manual reasoning.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
Given TPPi(y,z), y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This means z contains y and extends beyond it, and y touches the boundary of z.

For DC(x,z), x and z must be disconnected. This is possible if z doesn't extend to the part of y's boundary where x touches y. For example, if y is a circle, x touches y at the top, and z is a slightly larger circle that contains y but doesn't reach the top, then x and z are disconnected.

For EC(x,z), x and z must touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. This is possible if z extends to the exact part of y's boundary where x touches y. Using the circle example again, if y is a circle, x touches y at the top, and z is a slightly larger circle that contains y and also extends to the top, then x and z touch at the top.

For PO(x,z), x and z must share some interior parts, but neither can be a part of the other. Given that z contains y, and x touches y at a boundary, for x and z to share interior parts, z must extend beyond y's boundary at the point where x touches y. But this would mean that x and y also share interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

For TPP(x,z), x must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y at a boundary, and y is a proper part of z, it's possible for x to be entirely contained within z and touch z's boundary. This would be the case if x is small enough to fit within the portion of z that extends beyond y.

But wait, that doesn't work, because for x to be a part of z, x would have to share some interior with y (since y is part of z), which contradicts EC(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. This has the same issue as TPP; for x to be a part of z, x would have to share some interior with y, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z must be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. Given that z contains y, and y is externally connected to x, it's not possible for z to be a part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z must be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. This has the same issue as TPPi; it's not possible for z to be a part of x given the constraints. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z must be equal. Given the constraints, this is not possible because z contains y, and x is only externally connected to y. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this reasoning, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

Actually, hold on, I think this is still not quite right. Let me check a standard composition table from RCC-8.

Actually, my reasoning might be constrained by visualizing examples in 2D. Let me try to be more abstract.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
TPPi(y,z) means that y contains z as a tangential proper part, which means z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if z is contained within y such that it doesn't reach the boundary of y where x touches y.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z is contained within y and touches the boundary of y at the exact point where x touches y.

Let me make sure no other relationship is possible.

3. PO(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must share some interior points, but neither can be a part of the other. Since z is properly contained within y, and x is externally connected to y (meaning x and y don't share interior points), it's not possible for x and z to share interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. Given that x is externally connected to y, and z is properly contained within y, it's not possible for x to be a part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. This has the same issue as TPP; it's not possible for x to be a part of z given the constraints. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. Given that z is properly contained within y, and x only touches y at a boundary, it's not possible for z to be a part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. This has the same issue as TPPi; it's not possible for z to be a part of x given the constraints. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must be equal. Given that z is properly contained within y, and x only touches y at a boundary, it's not possible for x and z to be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this reasoning, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

Hmm, I'm noticing that I'm not being clear about the relationship between y and z. Let me clarify.

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z (not the other way around), which means y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary. Alternatively, it means that z is a tangential proper inverse of y, which might be confusing.

So, with TPPi(y,z), z is the "bigger" object that contains y. With this in mind, let's redo our analysis.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
Given TPPi(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Let's use a visual. Imagine y as a circle, and z as a larger circle that completely contains y but extends further. Now, x is an object that touches y at its boundary. Since z is larger than y and contains it, x might touch z as well, or it might be contained within z, or it might be partially overlapping with z, or it might be disconnected from z. Let's go through each case.

1. DC(x,z): Can x be disconnected from z? Well, if z is a circle that fully contains y, and x touches the boundary of y, then x must also touch or overlap with z. So, DC(x,z) seems impossible.

2. EC(x,z): Can x be externally connected to z? Yes, if x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x will also touch z at that point but won't share interior points with z.

3. PO(x,z): Can x partially overlap with z? Yes, if x touches y at a point and extends into z but not completely within z, then x and z will partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x touches y at a point and is otherwise fully contained within z, then x will be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, because if x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, then x will touch the boundary of z, making it at most a tangential proper part, not a non-tangential one.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? No, because z fully contains y, and x only touches y at a boundary. So, z cannot be a part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? No, for the same reason as TPPi; z cannot be a part of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? No, because z fully contains y, and x only touches y at a boundary. So, x and z cannot be equal.

Based on this reasoning, the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.

Wait, let's make sure that DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think DC(x,z) might be possible in some configurations. Imagine y as a circle that touches the boundary of z at a single point. Now, imagine x as touching y at a point that's diametrically opposite to where y touches z. In this case, x and z might be disconnected. But wait, if y is a tangential proper part of z, then y is fully contained within z, not just touching it, so this scenario doesn't work.

Let me reconsider the definition. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary. This means that every part of y, including its boundary, is within z or on the boundary of z.

Given that x touches the boundary of y (due to EC(x,y)), and every part of y's boundary is either within z or on the boundary of z, x must touch either the interior of z or the boundary of z. It can't be disconnected from z.

So, DC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let's re-check that NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. Given that x touches the boundary of y (due to EC(x,y)), and every part of y's boundary is either within z or on the boundary of z, if x is fully contained within z (which is needed for NTPP), then x might touch the boundary of z if the part of y's boundary that x touches is also on the boundary of z. But if the part of y's boundary that x touches is within z (not on z's boundary), then x won't touch z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is actually possible in some configurations.

Let me double check if NTPP(x,z) is possible.

I'm thinking of a scenario: y is a circle, z is a larger circle that contains y. Now, the boundary of y touches the boundary of z at one point. But x touches y at a different point, one that's not where y touches z. In this case, x is fully contained within z (since everything in and on y is in z) and doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, based on this reasoning, the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me triple check my reasoning here: 

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Visualizing: y is a region inside z, touching the boundary of z. x is a region outside y, touching the boundary of y.

For DC(x,z), x and z must be disconnected. Given that y is inside z, and x touches y, x must at least touch z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), x and z must touch at a boundary but not share interior parts. This is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z. Then, x will touch z at that point but won't share interior points with z.

For PO(x,z), x and z must share some interior parts, but neither can be a part of the other. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and extends into z, but also extends outside of z.

For TPP(x,z), x must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, and x is otherwise fully contained within z.

For NTPP(x,z), x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y at a point that's not where y touches the boundary of z, and x is fully contained within z.

For TPPi(x,z), z must be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. Given that y is inside z, and x touches y, it's not possible for z to be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z must be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. This has the same issue as TPPi; it's not possible for z to be inside x given the constraints. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z must be equal. Given that y is inside z, and x touches y, it's not possible for x to be equal to z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this reasoning, the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, I'm confusing myself. Let me really carefully analyze this situation.

We have EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary.

So, y is contained within z, touching z's boundary.
And x touches y's boundary, without overlapping with y.

Now, let's go through each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. 
   This would mean x doesn't touch or overlap with z. But since x touches y, and y is contained within z, x must at least touch z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
   This is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z. Then, x will touch z at that point but won't share interior points with z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share interior points, but neither is part of the other.
   This is possible if x touches y at the boundary but also extends into z (beyond the boundary of y) but not fully within z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
   This is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, and x is otherwise fully contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   This is possible if x touches y at a point that's not where y touches the boundary of z, and x is fully contained within z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
   This would mean z is contained within x. But since y is contained within z, and x is only touching y without overlapping, it's not possible for z to be contained within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   This has the same issue as TPPi; it's not possible for z to be contained within x given the constraints. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This would mean x and z occupy the same space. But since y is contained within z, and x is only touching y without overlapping, it's not possible for x to be equal to z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this reasoning, the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
- PO(x,z): x and z share interior points, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Alright, let's double-check our understanding of the situation and the reasoning step by step.

We have EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary. In other words, all of y (including its interior and boundary) is contained within z, with at least part of y's boundary touching z's boundary.

Now, for each possible relation between x and z, I will carefully determine if it's possible or not.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   For x and z to be disconnected, they should neither touch nor overlap.
   Given that x touches y's boundary, and all of y is contained within z (with some part of y's boundary touching z's boundary), x must at least touch z (if not overlap with it). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
   For this to be true, x and z should touch at a boundary but not overlap.
   This is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z. Then, x will touch z at that point but won't share interior points with z.
   This is also possible if x touches y at a different point, but x itself is strictly outside of z and only touches z's boundary.

Actually, I'm getting confused. Let me use a clear visual metaphor to think about this.

Imagine y is a small circle, and z is a larger circle that contains y. The circle y touches the boundary of z at a single point.

Now, imagine x as another circle that touches y at its boundary. There are several possible positions for x:

a. x could touch y at the same point where y touches z. In this case, x would also touch z at that point, making x and z externally connected (EC).

b. x could touch y at a different point, and x could be partially inside z and partially outside z. In this case, x and z would partially overlap (PO).

c. x could touch y at a different point, and x could be fully inside z, touching the boundary of z at a different point. In this case, x would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP).

d. x could touch y at a different point, and x could be fully inside z without touching the boundary of z. In this case, x would be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).

e. x could touch y at a different point, and x could be fully outside z but touching the boundary of z at a different point. In this case, x would be externally connected to z (EC).

f. x could touch y at a different point, and x could be fully outside z without touching the boundary of z. This would make x disconnected from z (DC), but this contradicts the fact that y is inside z, so this scenario is not possible.

This visualization confirms that the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
- PO(x,z): x and z share interior points, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's double check if there's a scenario where x can be disconnected from z.

TPPi(y,z) means y is tangentially contained in z. This means all of y (interior and boundary) is contained in z (interior and boundary), and at least part of y's boundary touches z's boundary. If x touches y, it must touch either the interior of y or the boundary of y. If it touches the interior of y, it touches the interior of z. If it touches the boundary of y, it either touches the interior of z or the boundary of z. In no case can x be disconnected from z.

Alright, so the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Ok, I believe these are the correct answers.

Let me check the problem once more to make sure I haven't missed anything.

We have EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is properly contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Based on our analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
- PO(x,z): x and z share interior points, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

These are the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given the constraints EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning z contains y and y touches z's boundary

Now I'll consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside z and x touches y, x must at least touch z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x will touch z's boundary without sharing interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at the boundary but extends partially into z and partially outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at a point and is otherwise fully contained within z, touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at a point that's not where y touches z's boundary, and x is fully contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. Since y is contained within z and x only touches y without overlapping, z cannot be contained within x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since y is contained within z and x only touches y, x cannot be equal to z.
