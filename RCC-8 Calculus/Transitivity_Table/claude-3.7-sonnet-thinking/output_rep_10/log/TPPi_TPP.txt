PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to reason about the possible relationships between x and z, given the relationships between x and y, and y and z.

Let's break down what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is fully contained in x, and touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. This implies that y is fully contained in z, and touches the boundary of z.

Given these two facts, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

We know that y is contained in both x and z. This means that x and z must share at least some common space, namely y. So they can't be disconnected (DC).

Let's think about the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we know that they share y, so this is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. But we know they share y, which is an interior part (since y touches the boundary but isn't the boundary itself). So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Given that y is contained in both x and z, but y is not all of x (since y is a proper part of x), and we don't know if z extends beyond x, this is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is fully contained in z and touches the boundary of z, this is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, this is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is contained in z and y is a proper part of x, it's not clear if z can be contained in x. Let's think about this carefully. 

If z were contained in x, then we would have y contained in z, and z contained in x. Since TPP(y,z), y touches the boundary of z. And since TPPi(x,y), y touches the boundary of x. It's possible that z also touches the boundary of x at the same place where y touches it. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the above, if z is contained in x but doesn't touch the boundary of x, this is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, this is a possibility only if x and z are the exact same region.

Let me check this more carefully:

We know that TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is strictly contained within x and touches the boundary of x.

We also know that TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is strictly contained within z and touches the boundary of z.

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): As we established, this is impossible because x and z share at least y.

2. EC(x,z): As we established, this is impossible because x and z share at least y, which is an interior part.

3. PO(x,z): This is a possibility. We know that x and z share y, but neither might be completely contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is contained in z and touches the boundary of z. 

Let's analyze this: We know y is contained in x (because TPPi(x,y)). We also know y is contained in z and touches the boundary of z (because TPP(y,z)). If x is contained in z, it must touch the boundary of z (for TPP(x,z) to be true). Given that y touches the boundary of z and y is contained in x, it's possible that x also touches the boundary of z at the same place. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

This is a bit trickier. We know y touches the boundary of z (since TPP(y,z)). If x is contained in z but doesn't touch the boundary of z, then the boundary of x must be entirely in the interior of z. But we know y touches the boundary of x (since TPPi(x,y)), so y must also be away from the boundary of z, which contradicts TPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

But we know y is contained in z (since TPP(y,z)) and y touches the boundary of x (since TPPi(x,y)). If z is contained in x, then the place where y touches the boundary of x must also be a place where z touches the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

But we know y touches the boundary of x (since TPPi(x,y)). If z is contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, then y (which is contained in z) can't touch the boundary of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. 

If x and z are identical, then y is a tangential proper part of both, which is consistent with our given facts. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me review my conclusions:
1. DC(x,z): Not possible.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible.
3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Possible.

Actually, I'm not sure about my reasoning for NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me think about these cases more carefully.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z without touching the boundary of z. But we know y is inside x and y touches the boundary of z. This would mean that x can touch the boundary of z through y, making it TPP(x,z) and not NTPP(x,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), we need z to be completely inside x without touching the boundary of x. But we know y is inside z and y touches the boundary of x. This would mean that z can touch the boundary of x through y, making it TPPi(x,z) and not NTPPi(x,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I was confused because I was thinking that "y touches the boundary of x" and "y touches the boundary of z" mean that y touches the same boundary point or segment. But this doesn't have to be the case. y can touch the boundary of x at one point and the boundary of z at another point.

Let me rethink:

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z without touching the boundary of z. 

But we know that y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), so y touches the boundary of x.
And we know that y is a tangential proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)), so y touches the boundary of z.

Given that y touches both the boundary of x and the boundary of z, and y is inside both x and z, it's possible that x touches the boundary of z at the same place where y touches it. But it's also possible that the part of y that touches the boundary of z is not the same as the part of y that touches the boundary of x. In that case, x might not touch the boundary of z.

Actually, let's be more precise.

From TPPi(x,y), we know that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is spatially contained in x.
- y intersects the boundary of x.

From TPP(y,z), we know that y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is spatially contained in z.
- y intersects the boundary of z.

Let's consider NTPP(x,z), which means:
- x is spatially contained in z.
- x doesn't intersect the boundary of z.

Given that y is inside x and y touches the boundary of z, if x is contained in z, then x must also touch the boundary of z at the same place where y touches it. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's consider NTPPi(x,z), which means:
- z is spatially contained in x.
- z doesn't intersect the boundary of x.

Given that y is inside z and y touches the boundary of x, if z is contained in x, then z must also touch the boundary of x at the same place where y touches it. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check the consistency of this reasoning:

Imagine three concentric circles: z is the outermost, x is in the middle, and y is the innermost. 
- The innermost circle (y) touches the boundary of the middle circle (x). This satisfies TPPi(x,y).
- The innermost circle (y) touches the boundary of the outermost circle (z). This satisfies TPP(y,z).
- The middle circle (x) touches the boundary of the outermost circle (z), making it TPP(x,z).

Now, let's imagine a different arrangement: z is the middle circle, x is the outermost, and y is the innermost.
- The innermost circle (y) touches the boundary of the outermost circle (x). This satisfies TPPi(x,y).
- The innermost circle (y) touches the boundary of the middle circle (z). This satisfies TPP(y,z).
- The middle circle (z) touches the boundary of the outermost circle (x), making it TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

And finally, let's imagine x and z as the same circle, with y being a smaller circle inside them.
- The inner circle (y) touches the boundary of the outer circle (x). This satisfies TPPi(x,y).
- The inner circle (y) touches the boundary of the outer circle (z). This satisfies TPP(y,z).
- The outer circles (x and z) are identical, making it EQ(x,z).

What about a partially overlapping case? Can we have a scenario where x and z partially overlap (PO(x,z)) and still satisfy both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z)?

Imagine two partially overlapping circles, x and z. The part where they overlap is y, and this y touches the boundary of both x and z. 
- y touches the boundary of x, which satisfies TPPi(x,y).
- y touches the boundary of z, which satisfies TPP(y,z).
- x and z partially overlap, giving PO(x,z).

Wait, I think I may have misunderstood the tangential part property. Let's be precise about the definitions:

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b, i.e., every point of a is a point of b, a is not equal to b, and a intersects the boundary of b.
TPPi(a,b) is the inverse, so it means b is a tangential proper part of a, i.e., TPP(b,a).

Now, for our problem:
TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is strictly inside x and touches the boundary of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is strictly inside z and touches the boundary of z.

Let's reconsider the possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. But this is impossible because they share at least y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors. This is also impossible because they share y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. For example, imagine two circles x and z that partially overlap, and the third circle y which is inside the intersection of x and z and touches the boundaries of both x and z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. Imagine z as the largest circle, x as a circle inside z that touches the boundary of z, and y as an even smaller circle inside x that touches the boundaries of both x and z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is impossible because y touches the boundary of both x and z. If x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y (which is inside x) can't touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. Imagine x as the largest circle, z as a circle inside x that touches the boundary of x, and y as an even smaller circle inside z that touches the boundaries of both x and z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because y touches the boundary of both x and z. If z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, then y (which is inside z) can't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. This is possible. Imagine x and z as the same circle, and y as a smaller circle inside them that touches their boundary.

So, based on this reasoning, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, I'm not sure if I'm reasoning correctly about the tangential proper part relationship. Let me be extremely precise with my understanding:

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. This means:
- a is a proper part of b, i.e., every point of a is a point of b, and a ≠ b.
- a touches the boundary of b, i.e., there's at least one point of a that's also on the boundary of b.

TPPi(a,b) is the inverse, meaning b is a tangential proper part of a. So, TPPi(a,b) = TPP(b,a).

Now, let's work through this again:

We know:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So, y is inside x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z. So, y is inside z and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider the possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Since y is inside both x and z, and x and z would have to share at least y, this is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors. This is also impossible for the same reason as above.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. Imagine x and z as two overlapping regions, and y is in the intersection of x and z, touching the boundaries of both.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means every point of x is a point of z, and x touches the boundary of z. 

Let's check if this is consistent:
- We know y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- We know y is inside z and touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- If x is inside z, the fact that y (which is inside x) touches the boundary of z means x can also touch the boundary of z. 

So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means every point of x is a point of z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let's check:
- We know y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- We know y is inside z and touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- If x is inside z, the fact that y (which is inside x) touches the boundary of z implies that x must also touch the boundary of z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means every point of z is a point of x, and z touches the boundary of x.

Let's check:
- We know y is inside x and touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- We know y is inside z (from TPP(y,z)).
- If z is inside x, the fact that y (which is inside z) touches the boundary of x means z can also touch the boundary of x.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means every point of z is a point of x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Let's check:
- We know y is inside x and touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- We know y is inside z (from TPP(y,z)).
- If z is inside x, the fact that y (which is inside z) touches the boundary of x implies that z must also touch the boundary of x.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. This means every point of x is a point of z, and vice versa.

Let's check:
- We know y is inside x and touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- We know y is inside z and touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- If x and z are the same, these conditions are consistent.

So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, I realize that I need to be even more careful in my reasoning. TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, which means that y is strictly contained within z and touches the boundary of z. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means that y is strictly contained within x and touches the boundary of x.

Now let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. But we know that y is contained in both x and z, so they can't be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors. But again, we know that y is contained in both x and z, so they must share interior parts. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means that some points of x are in z, some points of z are in x, and there are also points of x that are not in z and points of z that are not in x.

We know that y is contained in both x and z. If there are parts of x not in z and parts of z not in x, then x and z would partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means that every point of x is a point of z, but not every point of z is a point of x, and x touches the boundary of z.

We know that y is contained in x, and y touches the boundary of z. If every point of x is in z, then the fact that y (which is in x) touches the boundary of z suggests that x can also touch the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that every point of x is a point of z, but not every point of z is a point of x, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

We know that y is contained in x, and y touches the boundary of z. If every point of x is in z, then the fact that y (which is in x) touches the boundary of z implies that x must also touch the boundary of z. This contradicts the requirement for NTPP(x,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means that every point of z is a point of x, but not every point of x is a point of z, and z touches the boundary of x.

We know that y is contained in z, and y touches the boundary of x. If every point of z is in x, then the fact that y (which is in z) touches the boundary of x suggests that z can also touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that every point of z is a point of x, but not every point of x is a point of z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

We know that y is contained in z, and y touches the boundary of x. If every point of z is in x, then the fact that y (which is in z) touches the boundary of x implies that z must also touch the boundary of x. This contradicts the requirement for NTPPi(x,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. This means that every point of x is a point of z, and every point of z is a point of x.

We know that y is a tangential proper part of both x and z. If x and z are identical, then it makes sense that y would have the same relationship with both. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In conclusion, based on this reasoning, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

OK, let me check one more time more carefully. I realized that in some of my earlier analyses, I was a bit sloppy and sometimes said "touches the boundary" when I meant "intersects the boundary" (i.e., has non-empty intersection with the boundary). But I think the gist is correct.

For the question at hand, I'm given that:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So, y is contained in x, y ≠ x, and y intersects the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z. So, y is contained in z, y ≠ z, and y intersects the boundary of z.

Now, I want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. But we know that y is contained in both x and z, so they must share at least y. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors. Again, we know that y is contained in both x and z, so they must share interior parts. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. 

Let's see if this is consistent with our given conditions:
- We know y is contained in both x and z.
- If there are parts of x not in z and parts of z not in x, then they would partially overlap.
- The fact that y intersects the boundaries of both x and z is still consistent with x and z partially overlapping.

So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.

Let's check if this is consistent:
- We know y is contained in x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- We know y is contained in z and intersects the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- If x is contained in z, the fact that y (which is in x) intersects the boundary of z means that a part of x is at the boundary of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's check:
- We know y is contained in x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- We know y is contained in z and intersects the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- If x is contained in z, the fact that y (which is in x) intersects the boundary of z implies that a part of x is at the boundary of z, which contradicts the requirement for NTPP(x,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Let's check:
- We know y is contained in x and intersects the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- We know y is contained in z (from TPP(y,z)).
- If z is contained in x, the fact that y (which is in z) intersects the boundary of x means that a part of z is at the boundary of x.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let's check:
- We know y is contained in x and intersects the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- We know y is contained in z (from TPP(y,z)).
- If z is contained in x, the fact that y (which is in z) intersects the boundary of x implies that a part of z is at the boundary of x, which contradicts the requirement for NTPPi(x,z).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical.

Let's check:
- We know y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- We know y is a tangential proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- If x and z are identical, these conditions are consistent.

So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Wait, before I conclude, let me just make sure I haven't made any errors in the analysis above. The key point to check is whether, when y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, does it force x and z to have a tangential proper part relationship with each other? Let me consider the cases again:

For PO(x,z), I believe this is possible. For example, if y is a small region that sits at the intersection of x and z and touches the boundaries of both.

For TPP(x,z), I believe this is possible. For example, if z is a large region, x is a smaller region inside z that touches the boundary of z, and y is an even smaller region inside x that touches the boundaries of both x and z.

For TPPi(x,z), I believe this is possible, by a similar logic to the above.

For EQ(x,z), I believe this is possible. If x and z are the same region, and y is a smaller region inside them that touches their boundary.

For NTPP(x,z), I don't believe this is possible because if y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, then x must touch the boundary of z.

For NTPPi(x,z), I don't believe this is possible because if y touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then z must touch the boundary of x.

For DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), these are not possible because y is contained in both x and z, so they must share at least y.

So, based on this reasoning, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, I just realized that I've been making a terminological error. In the context of RCC-8, "tangential" means "touches the boundary" and "non-tangential" means "doesn't touch the boundary". The way I've been analyzing the cases is correct; I've just been misusing the terminology.

So, let me restate my answer more clearly:

For the question at hand, I'm given that:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So, y is contained in x, y ≠ x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z. So, y is contained in z, y ≠ z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

So the answer is: PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the implications of the given relationships and determine which of the eight RCC-8 relations could possibly hold between x and z.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because y is contained in both x and z, so they must share at least region y.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because x and z share region y, which is an interior part of both.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z could partially overlap, with y in their intersection and touching both boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be a tangential proper part of z, with y contained in x and touching both boundaries.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y (which is in x) couldn't touch z's boundary, contradicting TPP(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be a tangential proper part of x, with y contained in z and touching both boundaries.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (which is in z) couldn't touch x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. x and z could be identical, with y as a tangential proper part of both.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
