PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, I need to understand what NTPPi(x,y) means. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

Next, EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are the same spatial region. If we replace y with z in the relation NTPPi(x,y), we get NTPPi(x,z), which means NTPP(z,x).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In RCC-8 notation, this would be NTPPi(x,z).

To double-check: 
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is fully inside x, not touching the boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same.
- Therefore, z must also be fully inside x, not touching the boundary.

The only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this again. 

We have NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
We also have EQ(y,z), which means y and z are coincident.

If y and z are coincident, then any spatial relation that holds between x and y should also hold between x and z.

So if NTPPi(x,y), then we should have NTPPi(x,z).

Let me verify this one more time:

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, x properly contains y and y does not touch the boundary of x.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are spatially identical.

If y is completely contained within x (not touching x's boundary), and z is identical to y, then z must also be completely contained within x (not touching x's boundary).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what happens when we combine these two relations:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (identical spatial regions).

Since y and z are identical (due to EQ(y,z)), any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if NTPPi(x,y) is true and y is identical to z, then NTPPi(x,z) must also be true.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
