PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this carefully:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
2. EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.

Given these conditions, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Since y is a tangential proper part of x, y is fully contained within x except that y touches the boundary of x at some point(s). And since y and z are externally connected, they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This seems unlikely because y touches both x's boundary (from inside) and z's boundary. If y touches both, then x and z should at least be externally connected.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: This is possible if z touches x exactly at the point(s) where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, x and z would be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: This is possible if z extends both inside and outside of x, with the overlap region containing parts of y. Since y is a tangential proper part of x and is externally connected to z, z could partially overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This doesn't seem possible because y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is externally connected to z. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then y would be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-Tangential Proper Part: This would mean x is fully inside z without touching its boundary. This is definitely not possible because y, which is inside x, touches z's boundary, which means x must also touch z's boundary or extend outside z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse: This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is inside x and touches the boundary of x exactly where y touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse: This would mean z is fully inside x without touching its boundary. This doesn't seem possible because z touches y, and y touches the boundary of x. Therefore, z cannot be fully separated from the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. This isn't possible because y is a tangential proper part of x but is externally connected to z, which means y cannot be a tangential proper part of z (contradiction).

Hmm, wait, I'm not sure I've done this correctly. Let me think more carefully.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected

Let's visualize this: x is a larger region, y is a smaller region inside x that touches x's boundary, and z is a region outside of y that touches y's boundary.

Now, z could be positioned in different ways relative to x:

1. z could be completely outside of x, touching x's boundary exactly where y touches it. In this case, EC(x,z).

2. z could be partially inside and partially outside of x, with the inside part touching y's boundary. In this case, PO(x,z).

3. z could be completely inside x, touching y's boundary and also touching x's boundary. In this case, TPPi(z,x).

4. z could be completely inside x, touching y's boundary but not touching x's boundary. In this case, NTPPi(z,x).

Wait, I'm not sure if the last one is possible. If y touches x's boundary and z touches y's boundary, can z not touch x's boundary? Let me reconsider.

Actually, if y touches x's boundary at point P, and z touches y's boundary at point Q, and P and Q are different points, then z doesn't necessarily touch x's boundary. So, NTPPi(z,x) is possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. EC(x,z)
2. PO(x,z)
3. TPPi(z,x) (which is equivalent to TPP(x,z))
4. NTPPi(z,x) (which is equivalent to NTPP(x,z))

But wait, I'm getting confused with the directionality of the relationships. Let me double-check.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So x is the larger region, and y is the smaller region inside x that touches the boundary of x.

But then I say z could be completely inside x. This doesn't seem right given EC(y,z). If y is inside x and z is inside x, how can y and z be externally connected? They would both be inside x.

Oh, I see the confusion. I'm not considering that y, being a tangential proper part of x, touches the boundary of x. And if z is externally connected to y, then z touches the boundary of y. But the boundary of y could include parts that are within the interior of x, not just the part where y touches the boundary of x.

Let me start over.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): Can x and z be disconnected? If y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and z touches the boundary of y but is outside of y, then z could be completely outside of x. But then y would touch both the boundary of x and the boundary of z, which means x and z share a boundary point, so they are not disconnected. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) (Externally Connected): Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, if z is outside of x and touches the boundary of x exactly where y also touches the boundary of x, then x and z are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if z extends both inside and outside of x, and the part of z inside x touches y, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? No, because y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y also touches the boundary of z. If x were inside z, then y would be inside z too, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) (Non-Tangential Proper Part): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, for the same reason as above.

6. TPPi(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part Inverse): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and z also touches y, then z is a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is completely inside x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, but touches the boundary of y, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z) (Equal): Can x and z be equal? No, because y is inside x but externally connected to z, which means y cannot be inside z, contradicting x = z.

Hmm, hold up, I need to reconsider again. I realized I've been visualizing this wrong. Let me remember the definitions clearly:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, since y touches the boundary of x (due to TPPi(x,y)), and z touches the boundary of y (due to EC(y,z)), let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

The point where y and z touch is on the boundary of y. This point can either be on the boundary of x as well (where y touches x) or it can be inside x (not on the boundary of x).

1. If the point where y and z touch is on the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x at that point. Since z is not inside x (otherwise, it would overlap with y, which contradicts EC(y,z)), the relationship between x and z is either EC(x,z) or PO(x,z).

2. If the point where y and z touch is inside x (not on the boundary of x), then z extends into the interior of x to touch y, but not the entire of z is inside x (otherwise, it would overlap with y, which contradicts EC(y,z)). In this case, the relationship is PO(x,z).

Wait, maybe I'm confused again. Let me take a step back and visualize this clearly:

TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected.

Visualization: x is a larger region, y is a smaller region inside x and touches the boundary of x, and z is a region that touches the boundary of y but doesn't overlap with y.

Now, z can be positioned in various ways:

1. z can be completely outside of x, touching the boundary of y exactly where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, x and z are externally connected, so EC(x,z).

2. z can partially extend into x to touch y's boundary at a point inside x (not on the boundary of x), and partially outside of x. In this case, x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z).

3. z can be completely inside x, touching y's boundary. Since y touches the boundary of x, z might or might not touch the boundary of x. If z touches the boundary of x, then z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z). If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. EC(x,z)
2. PO(x,z)
3. TPPi(x,z)
4. NTPPi(x,z)

Okay, wait, let's take this one more time. I'm not sure I've got it right, because of uncertainty about TPPi.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

OK, so y is properly inside x but touches the boundary of x. And z is outside of y, touches the boundary of y, but doesn't overlap with y. Let's consider what this means for the possible relationships between x and z.

First, can x and z be disconnected, i.e. DC(x,z)? No, because y is inside x, y touches z, and so x must intersect with z.

OK, what about z being externally connected to x, i.e. EC(x,z)? Yes, if z is outside x, and the point where y and z touch is on the boundary of x. Specifically, this would be the case if y touches x at point P, and y also touches z at point P, and z is otherwise completely outside of x. So x and z touch at their boundaries but have no overlapping parts, and EC(x,z) is possible.

Can x and z partially overlap, i.e. PO(x,z)? Yes, if part of z is inside x and part is outside x, and z doesn't completly contain x nor is it completely contained in x. This is possible if y touches the boundary of x at point P, but y and z touch at a different point Q that is inside x. So z extends partially into x to touch y, and partially outside of x. So PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Can x be a tangential proper part of z, i.e. TPP(x,z)? No, since y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e. TPPi(x,y), and y is externally connected to z, i.e. EC(y,z), it means y is inside x and outside z. So x cannot be properly inside z, and TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e. NTPP(x,z)? No, for the same reason as above.

Can z be a tangential proper part of x, i.e. TPPi(x,z)? Yes, if z is properly inside x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible if, for example, y touches the boundary of x at point P, z touches the boundary of x at point P, and z also touches y at a different point Q inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e. NTPPi(x,z)? Yes, if z is properly inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible if y touches the boundary of x at point P, but y and z touch at a different point Q inside x, and z is completely inside x away from the boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Can x and z be equal, i.e. EQ(x,z)? No, because y is inside x (due to TPPi(x,y)) but not inside z (due to EC(y,z)), so x and z cannot be the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. EC(x,z)
2. PO(x,z)
3. TPPi(x,z)
4. NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, actually, I realized I'm a bit confused about TPPi. Let me check the definitions again.

Ok, so TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(y,x). Since TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is properly inside x and touches the boundary of x), TPPi(x,y) means x is such that y is a tangential proper part of it.

So given TPPi(x,y), y is properly inside x and touches the boundary of x.
And given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): Can x and z be disconnected? If y is inside x and touches z, then x and z must have a point in common (at least the point where y and z touch), so they can't be disconnected. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) (Externally Connected): Can x and z be externally connected? Yes, if z is outside x and the point where y and z touch is on the boundary of x. In this case, x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if part of z is inside x (to touch y) and part is outside x. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? No, because y is inside x but not inside z (due to EC(y,z)), so x cannot be inside z. Thus, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (Non-Tangential Proper Part): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, for the same reason as above. Thus, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part Inverse): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible if, for example, z is inside x, touches the boundary of x, and also touches y inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x (away from the boundary) and touches y inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) (Equal): Can x and z be equal? No, because y is inside x (due to TPPi(x,y)) but not inside z (due to EC(y,z)), so x and z cannot be the same region. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. EC(x,z)
2. PO(x,z)
3. TPPi(x,z)
4. NTPPi(x,z)

OK I've considered it carefully, and convinced myself of the answer.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
1. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected
2. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping
3. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
4. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x

The answer is: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap)

Let me analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Not possible. Since y touches z and y is part of x, x and z must have at least a touching point.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: Possible if z is outside x and touches x's boundary at exactly where y touches x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: Possible if part of z extends into x (to touch y) while part remains outside x.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: Not possible because y is inside x but not inside z (as y and z only touch at boundaries).

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: Possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary while also touching y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: Possible if z is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) while touching y.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Not possible because y is inside x but only externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
