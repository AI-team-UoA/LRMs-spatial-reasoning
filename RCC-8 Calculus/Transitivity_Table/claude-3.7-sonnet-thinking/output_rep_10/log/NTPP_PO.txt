PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to figure out the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's analyze what these relations mean:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $y$. This means $x$ is fully inside $y$ without touching $y$'s boundary.

2. PO(y,z) means that $y$ and $z$ partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Now, I need to determine what these two constraints imply about the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$.

Since $x$ is fully inside $y$ without touching $y$'s boundary, and $y$ partially overlaps with $z$, there are a few possibilities for how $x$ and $z$ relate:

1. $x$ could be completely inside the overlapping region of $y$ and $z$. In this case, $x$ would be a non-tangential proper part of $z$ as well, so NTPP(x,z).

2. $x$ could be completely outside the overlapping region of $y$ and $z$ (but still inside $y$). In this case, $x$ and $z$ would be disconnected, so DC(x,z).

3. $x$ could partially overlap with the overlapping region of $y$ and $z$. In this case, $x$ and $z$ would partially overlap, so PO(x,z).

4. $x$ could be touching the boundary of the overlapping region from inside $y$. This is tricky because it depends on how the overlapping region's boundary relates to $z$'s boundary. 

Let me think about case 4 more carefully. If $x$ touches the boundary of the overlapping region from inside $y$, and that boundary is part of $z$'s boundary, then $x$ would be externally connected to $z$, so EC(x,z). But if that boundary is internal to $z$, then $x$ would still partially overlap with $z$, so PO(x,z).

5. $x$ could be completely inside $z$, but touching $z$'s boundary from the inside. In this case, $x$ would be a tangential proper part of $z$, so TPP(x,z).

Let me double-check these possibilities with some visual thinking:

NTPP(x,y) means:
```
   +---------------+
   |       y       |
   |   +-------+   |
   |   |   x   |   |
   |   +-------+   |
   |               |
   +---------------+
```

And PO(y,z) means:
```
   +---------------+     +---------------+
   |               |     |               |
   |        +------+-----+------+        |
   |        |      |     |      |        |
   |   y    |      |     |      |    z   |
   |        |      |     |      |        |
   |        +------+-----+------+        |
   |               |     |               |
   +---------------+     +---------------+
```

Now, combining these, where could $x$ be?

Case 1 (NTPP(x,z)): $x$ is completely inside the overlapping region
```
   +---------------+     +---------------+
   |               |     |               |
   |        +------+-----+------+        |
   |        |  +---+--+  |      |        |
   |   y    |  | x    |  |      |    z   |
   |        |  +---+--+  |      |        |
   |        +------+-----+------+        |
   |               |     |               |
   +---------------+     +---------------+
```

Case 2 (DC(x,z)): $x$ is completely inside $y$ but outside $z$
```
   +---------------+     +---------------+
   |               |     |               |
   |  +-------+    +-----+------+        |
   |  |   x   |    |     |      |        |
   |  +-------+    |     |      |    z   |
   |      y        |     |      |        |
   |        +------+-----+------+        |
   |               |     |               |
   +---------------+     +---------------+
```

Case 3 (PO(x,z)): $x$ partially overlaps with $z$
```
   +---------------+     +---------------+
   |               |     |               |
   |        +------+-----+------+        |
   |    +---+----+ |     |      |        |
   |    |   x    +-+-----+      |    z   |
   |    +--------+ |     |      |        |
   |      y +------+-----+------+        |
   |               |     |               |
   +---------------+     +---------------+
```

Case 5 (TPP(x,z)): $x$ is completely inside $z$, touching $z$'s boundary
```
   +---------------+     +---------------+
   |               |     |               |
   |        +------+-----+------+        |
   |        |      |     |      |        |
   |   y    |    +-+-----+----+ |    z   |
   |        |    | x     |    | |        |
   |        +----+-------+----+-+        |
   |               |     |               |
   +---------------+     +---------------+
```

I'm still not sure about EC(x,z). Let me try to visualize it:

Case 4 (EC(x,z)): $x$ touches $z$ at the boundary but doesn't overlap
```
   +---------------+     +---------------+
   |               |     |               |
   |        +------+-----+------+        |
   |        |      |     |      |        |
   |   y  +-+------+     |      |    z   |
   |      | x     ||     |      |        |
   |      +-------++-----+------+        |
   |               |     |               |
   +---------------+     +---------------+
```

But I realize that this doesn't work. Since NTPP(x,y), $x$ cannot touch the boundary of $y$. So $x$ can't touch the boundary where $y$ and $z$ meet, which means $x$ can't be externally connected to $z$. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider the possibilities:

1. NTPP(x,z): $x$ is fully inside the overlapping region of $y$ and $z$, away from $z$'s boundary.
2. TPP(x,z): $x$ is fully inside $z$, touching $z$'s boundary from inside.
3. PO(x,z): $x$ partially overlaps with $z$.
4. DC(x,z): $x$ is fully inside $y$ but outside $z$.

Wait, I think I missed a case. Let's consider NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) more carefully.

Since NTPP(x,y), $x$ is fully inside $y$ without touching $y$'s boundary.
Since PO(y,z), $y$ and $z$ share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

The key insight is that the boundary of the overlapping region between $y$ and $z$ consists of parts of $y$'s boundary and parts of $z$'s boundary.

Since $x$ is NTPP to $y$, $x$ cannot touch any part of $y$'s boundary. But $x$ could touch a part of $z$'s boundary that is inside $y$.

So the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are:

1. NTPP(x,z): $x$ is fully inside $z$ without touching $z$'s boundary.
2. TPP(x,z): $x$ is fully inside $z$, touching $z$'s boundary from inside.
3. PO(x,z): $x$ partially overlaps with $z$.
4. DC(x,z): $x$ is fully inside $y$ but outside $z$.

Let me verify this with one more example to make sure I haven't missed anything.

Is EC(x,z) possible? No, because for EC(x,z) to hold, $x$ and $z$ would need to touch at a boundary without sharing interior points. But since $x$ is NTPP to $y$, it cannot touch the boundary of $y$, which is where it would need to touch $z$ if it were EC to $z$.

Is TPPi(x,z) possible? No, because TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which would mean $z$ is a tangential proper part of $x$. But since $x$ is NTPP to $y$, and $y$ is PO to $z$, $z$ cannot be contained in $x$.

Is NTPPi(x,z) possible? No, for similar reasons to TPPi.

Is EQ(x,z) possible? No, because if $x$ and $z$ were equal, then since $x$ is NTPP to $y$, $z$ would also be NTPP to $y$, which contradicts PO(y,z).

So the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are DC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Hmm, actually, let me verify each one of these again.

NTPP(x,z) is possible. If $x$ is fully contained in the overlapping region of $y$ and $z$, and doesn't touch the boundary of that region, then $x$ is NTPP to $z$.

TPP(x,z) is possible. If $x$ is fully contained in the overlapping region of $y$ and $z$, and touches the boundary of that region where it's part of $z$'s boundary, then $x$ is TPP to $z$.

PO(x,z) is possible. If $x$ partially overlaps with the overlapping region of $y$ and $z$, then $x$ is PO to $z$.

DC(x,z) is possible. If $x$ is fully contained in the part of $y$ that doesn't overlap with $z$, then $x$ is DC to $z$.

EC(x,z) is not possible. For $x$ to be EC to $z$, it would need to touch the boundary of $z$ without sharing interior points. But since $x$ is NTPP to $y$, it cannot touch the boundary of $y$, which is where it would need to touch $z$ if it were EC to $z$.

Actually, let's double-check this carefully. Could it be that $x$ touches the boundary of $z$ that is inside $y$? But if $z$'s boundary is inside $y$, and $x$ touches it, that would mean $x$ and $z$ share at least one point, which is on the boundary of $z$. But this point is an interior point of $y$ (since $z$'s boundary is inside $y$). So $x$ and $z$ would share an interior point of $y$, which means they partially overlap, not externally connect.

So EC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which would mean $z$ is a tangential proper part of $x$. But since $x$ is NTPP to $y$, $x$ is strictly smaller than $y$. And since $y$ is PO to $z$, $z$ is not fully contained in $y$, let alone in $x$. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which would mean $z$ is a non-tangential proper part of $x$. This is not possible for the same reason TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) means $x$ and $z$ are equal. But since $x$ is NTPP to $y$, and $y$ is PO to $z$, $x$ and $z$ cannot be equal.

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. PO(x,z)
3. TPP(x,z)
4. NTPP(x,z)

OK, now let me recap and provide the final answer.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $y$ (fully inside without touching the boundary)
- PO(y,z): $y$ and $z$ partially overlap

The possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
- DC(x,z): $x$ is disconnected from $z$ (when $x$ is in the part of $y$ that doesn't overlap with $z$)
- PO(x,z): $x$ partially overlaps with $z$ (when $x$ crosses the boundary between the overlapping and non-overlapping regions)
- TPP(x,z): $x$ is a tangential proper part of $z$ (when $x$ is fully inside $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary)
- NTPP(x,z): $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $z$ (when $x$ is fully inside $z$ away from the boundary)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), I'll analyze what these conditions tell us:

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share some interior points but neither is contained in the other.

Given these constraints, I'll consider all possible positions of x relative to z:

1. x could be entirely inside the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
   This gives us DC(x,z).

2. x could be positioned so it partially falls within the overlapping region of y and z.
   This gives us PO(x,z).

3. x could be completely inside the overlapping region of y and z, touching z's boundary.
   This gives us TPP(x,z).

4. x could be completely inside the overlapping region, not touching z's boundary.
   This gives us NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible given the constraints.

### Answer: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
