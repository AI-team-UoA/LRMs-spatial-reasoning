PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what these relations mean:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. In other words, y is completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. So z completely contains y, and y is not touching the boundary of z.

Now, let's try to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y) -> y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
2. NTPP(y,z) -> y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary

We know that y is completely inside both x and z. However, this doesn't tell us exactly how x and z relate to each other. Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This seems impossible because y is a part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least some spatial part (namely, y). So DC is not a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is also impossible because y is an interior part of both x and z, so x and z must share an interior part. So EC is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. x contains y, and z contains y, but there could be parts of x that are not in z and parts of z that are not in x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. x contains y, which is completely inside z, but x could extend all the way to the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible. x could be completely contained within z, just as y is.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. z contains y, which is completely inside x, but z could extend all the way to the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible. z could be completely contained within x, just as y is.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This means x and z are the same spatial region. This is possible. If x and z are the same, they both contain y in the same way.

But wait, let's double-check my reasoning. I think I need to be more careful, because it's not just that y is inside both x and z; the specific relations are NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Let's analyze the possible relations more carefully:

1. DC(x,z): As I said, this is impossible because x and z both contain y, so they must overlap.

2. EC(x,z): This is also impossible for the same reason. x and z share an interior part (namely, y), so they can't just touch at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x contains y, and z contains y, but there could be parts of x that are not in z and parts of z that are not in x.

4. TPP(x,z): Is this possible? TPP(x,z) means that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. We know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. We also know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. 

    If x touches z's boundary, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y is indeed completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, this relation is possible. x could be completely contained within z, not touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But wait, z contains y, which doesn't touch z's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then y is inside x but might be close to x's boundary (since z is touching x's boundary). But we know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. I think TPPi(x,z) is still possible, but let's think more carefully.

    If TPPi(x,z), then z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means y is even more "inside" x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then y is certainly completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same spatial region. If x and z are the same, then y should have the same relation to both. But we're given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), which are inverse relations. This seems to be a contradiction, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me double-check the inconsistency of EQ(x,z).

If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same. If they're the same, then the relation between x and y should be the same as the relation between z and y. But we're given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), which are inverse relations. Specifically, NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which is the opposite of NTPP(y,z) if x and z are the same. This is a contradiction, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let's summarize: The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I'm going to double-check all of these relations.

1. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. We know y is contained in both x and z, so they do overlap. But for PO, neither can be a proper part of the other. Is this consistent with the given relations?

   NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
   NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
   
   So both x and z fully contain y. But this doesn't tell us about parts of x that might be outside z, or parts of z that might be outside x. If there are parts of x outside z and parts of z outside x, then PO(x,z) is valid. So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Is this consistent?

   NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
   NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
   
   If x is completely inside z, then any part of x (including y) is also inside z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). And if y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, that's consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Is this consistent?

   Similar to the above, if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then any part of x (including y) is also inside z without touching z's boundary, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). And if y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, that's consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Is this consistent?

   NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
   NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
   
   If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary (since y is inside z, which is inside x). This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Is this consistent?

   Similar to the above, if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. EQ(x,z): As I analyzed earlier, this is not consistent with the given relations. NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) imply different relations between y and the identical x and z, which is a contradiction.

7. DC(x,z) and EC(x,z): As I analyzed earlier, these are not possible because x and z both contain y, so they must overlap in their interiors.

So my earlier summary was correct. The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, let me think more about TPPi(x, z). If TPPi(x, z), then z is a proper part of x, touching the boundary of x. But we also know that NTPP(y,z), so y is a proper part of z, not touching the boundary of z. But we also know that NTPPi(x,y), so y is non-tangentially contains x, meaning it's a proper superset of x (and similarly, x is a proper subset of y).

Wait, that's not right. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x, not touching the boundary of x. So y is a proper part of x and is contained "deep" inside x (not touching the boundary of x).

So we know:
- y is a proper part of x, not touching the boundary of x.
- y is a proper part of z, not touching the boundary of z.

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x, touching the boundary of x. But we know y is a proper part of z, not touching the boundary of z. This means y is even more "inside" x, which is consistent with "y is a proper part of x, not touching the boundary of x." So TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Okay, I've checked all the relations, and my analysis stands: The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait. I think I need to be more careful about my understanding of these relations. Let me revisit the definitions to make sure:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. So y is completely contained in the interior of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is completely contained in the interior of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, I'll consider each possible relation between x and z and check if it's consistent with the given relations.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. If y is a part of both x and z, then x and z must share at least y, so they can't be disconnected. DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share an interior. If y is a part of the interior of both x and z, then x and z must share an interior, so EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Both contain y, which is consistent with overlap. But for partial overlap, neither can be a proper part of the other. This is still possible based on the given information. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Is this consistent with the given relations?

   If x is a proper part of z, then any part of x (including y) is also a part of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). And if y is a non-tangential proper part of x, that's consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Is this consistent?

   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then any part of x (including y) is also a non-tangential proper part of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). And if y is a non-tangential proper part of x, that's consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Is this consistent?

   If z is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). But we need to check if y can be a non-tangential proper part of both x and z.

   If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then y is definitely a non-tangential proper part of x (because y is not only inside x but inside z, which is inside x). This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Is this consistent?

   If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then y is definitely a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. Is this consistent?

   If x and z are the same, then y should have the same relation to both. But we're given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), which implies NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z). If x and z are the same, these two relations should be the same, which they are. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Wait, that's not right. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), not NTPP(x,y). So if NTPPi(x,y), then y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same. Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we have NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z). If x and z are the same, then these two relations should be the same, which they are. So EQ(x,z) is indeed possible. I made an error in my previous analysis.

Let me re-check all the relations:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as I correctly analyzed before.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible, as I correctly analyzed before.
3. PO(x,z): Possible, as I correctly analyzed before.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible, as I correctly analyzed before.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible, as I correctly analyzed before.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible, as I correctly analyzed before.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible, as I correctly analyzed before.
8. EQ(x,z): Possible, as I just re-analyzed.

Wait, I think I misunderstood NTPPi again. Let's be clear: NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x). So NTPPi(x,y) means y non-tangentially contains x, or x is a non-tangential proper part of y.

No, that's still not right. Let me be more careful.

NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP, which means NTPP(y,x). This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Hmm, let's think about EQ(x,z) again. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same. Given NTPPi(x,y), we know NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given NTPP(y,z), we know y is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x and z are the same, then these two statements are consistent: y is a non-tangential proper part of the same entity (x or z). So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Let me double-check PO(x,z). If PO(x,z), then x and z partially overlap, which means neither is a proper part of the other. Given that y is a non-tangential proper part of both x and z, is this possible? Yes, consider a scenario where x and z both non-tangentially contain y, but x has parts outside of z, and z has parts outside of x. This is consistent with PO(x,z).

I think my final list is correct. The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, I realize there's a logical constraint here I need to respect, which is the transitivity of the NTPP relation. It's a property of NTPP that if NTPP(a,b) and NTPP(b,c), then NTPP(a,c). I need to check if this property holds for the possible relations I've identified. 

We have NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), and NTPP(y,z). From the transitivity of NTPP, if NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(x,z), then NTPP(y,z). But we already know NTPP(y,z), so that doesn't constrain the relation between x and z. We can't apply the transitivity property here because the middle terms don't match.

Let's try the composition table for RCC8 relations to see what our composition is. We need to compute NTPPi ∘ NTPP, which is the composition of NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). 

According to the RCC8 composition table, NTPPi ∘ NTPP = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}.

Wait, that would mean all 8 RCC8 relations are possible between x and z. But I've already established that DC and EC are not possible because y is a part of both x and z, so they must overlap. So I think there's a problem with this approach.

In fact, I think my reasoning is wrong here about DC and EC. Let's think about this more carefully. 

We have NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), and NTPP(y,z).

Now, let's think about what this means geometrically:
- NTPP(y,x): y is completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z.

So y is inside both x and z, not touching the boundaries of either. This means x and z both contain y, but this doesn't necessarily mean x and z must overlap beyond y. They could both contain y in completely different parts of space, with no other overlap.

Actually, that's wrong. If y is a region of space that's inside both x and z, then x and z must overlap at least in the region y. So my original reasoning was correct: DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible.

Let me try a different approach. The composition of NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) means we're looking for all possible relations R such that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) implies R(x,z).

Let's think about this intuitively: 
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z.

What can we say about the relation between x and z? Well, they both contain y, so they must overlap. But beyond that, there are several possibilities:
- x and z might partially overlap, with parts of x outside z and parts of z outside x. This is PO(x,z).
- x might be completely inside z, touching z's boundary. This is TPP(x,z).
- x might be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This is NTPP(x,z).
- z might be completely inside x, touching x's boundary. This is TPPi(x,z).
- z might be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z).
- x and z might be the same. This is EQ(x,z).

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ.

This is consistent with what I've found in my earlier analysis.

In fact, I don't think DC and EC can be part of the composition because the composition requires that the middle term in the two relations is the same (in this case, y). So the composition of NTPPi ∘ NTPP is looking at all the possible relations between the outer terms (x and z) when the conditions NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are given. And as I've established, DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible in this case.

So I believe the correct list is: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ.

Wait, let me double-check my general understanding of the composition of relations. The composition of relations R1 and R2, denoted R1 ∘ R2, is the set of all relations R such that there exists some intermediate entity such that the first relation holds between the first entity and the intermediate, and the second relation holds between the intermediate and the third entity. That is, (R1 ∘ R2)(x,z) if and only if there exists some y such that R1(x,y) and R2(y,z).

But here, we're not looking for the composition in general. We're given specific relations NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), and we want to know the possible relation(s) between x and z given these constraints. So we're not looking for the full composition NTPPi ∘ NTPP, but rather the subset of the composition that's possible given the specific entities x, y, and z.

So my reasoning is correct: The possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ.

But to be sure, I should double-check the full composition NTPPi ∘ NTPP to make sure I'm not missing anything. According to RCC8 composition tables:

NTPPi ∘ NTPP = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}.

This would suggest that all RCC8 relations are possible, but I've already shown that DC and EC are not possible in this case. So either the composition table is wrong or my reasoning is wrong.

Let me think through a specific spatial example of NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). The constraints are:
- y is completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x (NTPP(y,x) or NTPPi(x,y)).
- y is completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z (NTPP(y,z)).

Let's visualize this with circles:
- x is a big circle
- y is a small circle entirely inside x, not touching the boundary of x
- z is a circle that entirely contains y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z

Now, the question is: what are the possible arrangements of x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z don't overlap at all. But since y is inside both x and z, this is impossible. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share an interior. But since y is inside both x and z, x and z must share an interior (namely, the region containing y). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, with parts of x outside z and parts of z outside x. This is possible. For example, x could be a big circle, z could be another big circle, and y could be a small circle in the overlapping region of x and z.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible. For example, x could be a big circle completely inside an even bigger circle z, touching the boundary of z, and y could be a small circle completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is possible. For example, x could be a big circle completely inside an even bigger circle z, not touching the boundary of z, and y could be a small circle completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible. For example, z could be a big circle completely inside an even bigger circle x, touching the boundary of x, and y could be a small circle completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible. For example, z could be a big circle completely inside an even bigger circle x, not touching the boundary of x, and y could be a small circle completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. This is possible. For example, x and z could be the same big circle, and y could be a small circle completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.

So based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ. This is consistent with my earlier analysis.

Wait, but that's inconsistent with what the composition table says. Let me reconsider. 

Actually, I think my intuition about DC and EC not being possible is wrong. Let me think about it differently. 

We have NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), and NTPP(y,z). That is, y is a non-tangential proper part of both x and z. But that doesn't mean y completely fills up either x or z. There's nothing in the constraints that says y must be a significant portion of either x or z. y could be a small portion of both x and z, and x and z could be largely disjoint. 

For example, imagine a tiny circle y, and two large circles x and z that each contain y but are otherwise disjoint. In this case, y is a non-tangential proper part of both x and z, but x and z don't overlap except for the tiny region y.

Actually, that doesn't work. If y is a region that's inside both x and z, then x and z must overlap at least in the region y. So they can't be disjoint (DC) or merely touching (EC). My original reasoning was correct.

Now I'm confused about why the composition table would include DC and EC. Let me reconsider.

Wait, I think I understand the issue. The composition NTPPi ∘ NTPP is the set of all possible relations between x and z such that there exists some y where NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). But when we're given specific entities x, y, and z and specific relations NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we're not looking for all possible relations in the composition; we're looking for the specific relation(s) that hold between the specific entities x and z.

In our case, since we're given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) hold for specific entities x, y, and z, we can rule out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) because, as I've established, they're inconsistent with the given relations. 

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

But wait, there's actually another constraint at play. We know from RCC8 that, for proper parts (e.g., NTPP(a,b)) we must have:
- if a is a proper part of b and b is a proper part of c, then a is a proper part of c (transitivity)

From our given relations, we have NTPP(y,x) (from NTPPi(x,y)) and NTPP(y,z). But this doesn't constrain the relation between x and z because of the orientation of the proper part relations.

From NTPP(y,x) we know y is a proper part of x (not the other way around). And from NTPP(y,z) we know y is a proper part of z (not the other way around). The transitivity of NTPP would only constrain the relation between x and z if we had something like NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(x,z), which would then imply NTPP(y,z). But we don't have that here.

I've been trying to remember if there's another transitivity rule for NTPP, but I don't think there is. The standard transitivity rule for NTPP is the one I mentioned above: if NTPP(a,b) and NTPP(b,c), then NTPP(a,c).

Let me search for a more complete RCC8 composition table to make sure. 

According to the standard RCC8 composition table, the composition of NTPPi ∘ NTPP is: {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}.

But as I've been explaining, this composition represents all the possible relations between x and z such that there exists some y where NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). It doesn't represent the possible relations for specific entities x, y, and z when the relations NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are given.

And as I've established, DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible in this case, because if y is a region that's inside both x and z, then x and z must overlap at least in the region y. They can't be disjoint (DC) or merely touching (EC).

Hang on, if the relations are really NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), and y is a region of space, then we know that NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. And NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. Given these two facts, it's certain that x and z overlap (at least by the region y). This might not have been evident from the RCC8 composition table, but it's a consequence of the specific relations and the specific regions we're talking about. So even if the RCC8 composition table says all relations are possible, in this specific case with these specific entities, DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Wait, I'm confused again. The question is asking about a relation between specific x, y, and z. It's not asking for the full NTPPi ∘ NTPP composition. And I've established that DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible in this case.

I think the confusion might be that I'm trying to use the RCC8 composition table to answer the question, but the composition table might not directly apply to the specific scenario in the question.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

This is my final answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what these given relations tell us about the spatial relationship between x and z.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary

Since y is contained within both x and z, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

First, I can rule out some relationships:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and z must overlap at least in region y
- EC(x,z) is impossible because x and z share interior parts (specifically y)

The remaining possible relationships are:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (with y in their shared region)
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are exactly the same region

### Answer: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ
