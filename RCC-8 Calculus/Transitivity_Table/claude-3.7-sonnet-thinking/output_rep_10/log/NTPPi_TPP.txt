PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's consider what these two premises mean:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.

2. TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

So we have that y is completely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary, and y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

I need to figure out what the possible relationships between x and z are based on these constraints.

Let's consider the possibilities systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This would mean x and z share no points. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least some points (specifically, they share y). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But we know y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This would mean x and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. This seems possible. We know that y is contained in both x and z, but there could be parts of x outside of z and parts of z outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. This seems possible. We know that y is contained in both x and z, and y touches z's boundary. So if x includes y and some additional parts up to z's boundary, but doesn't extend beyond z, then TPP(x,z) would hold.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: This would mean x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This doesn't seem possible. We know that y touches z's boundary and y is contained in x. So x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. This seems possible. We know that y is contained in z and y doesn't touch x's boundary. So z could be contained in x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: This would mean z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This doesn't seem possible. We know that y touches z's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary. But if z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, then y couldn't touch z's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. This seems possible. If x and z are the same, then y would be contained in both and touch the boundary of both, which is consistent with our premises.

Wait, I made an error. If y touches z's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, that means y is further from x's boundary than z's boundary. Let me reconsider some of these.

Actually, let me think step by step about this. We know:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Now, we need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about this spatially:

First, since y is completely inside both x and z, we know that x and z must overlap.

Next, since y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary, we know that z's boundary must be "closer in" than x's boundary, at least at some points.

Let's consider the possibilities again:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Not possible because x and z share y.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Not possible because x and z share y, which is an interior point of both.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This means x and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. This seems possible. y is in the overlapping region, y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. But we know y is completely inside x and touches z's boundary. So if x were completely inside z, then y would need to reach x's boundary to be able to touch z's boundary. But y doesn't touch x's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, I think I need to be more careful about my reasoning.

Let's reconsider with diagrams in mind.

NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Imagine x as a large circle and y as a smaller circle completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.

TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Imagine z as a circle that completely contains y, and y touches z's boundary at some point.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

The fact that y is completely inside both x and z means there's definitely some overlap between x and z.

The fact that y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary means that z's boundary must be "closer in" than x's boundary, at least at some points.

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Not possible because x and z share y.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Not possible because x and z share y, which is an interior point of both.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This means x and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. This seems possible. y is in the overlapping region, y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is completely inside x and touches z's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, it seems like x must extend beyond y to touch z's boundary, but still be completely contained within z. So this seems possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: This would mean x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But we know y touches z's boundary, and y is completely inside x. So x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary, for z to be completely inside x, z's boundary must be between y and x's boundary. This seems possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: This would mean z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But given that y touches z's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, for z to not touch x's boundary, z must be between y and x's boundary. This seems possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. But we know y touches z's boundary and doesn't touch x's boundary. So x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider. I think there's still an issue with my analysis, because I'm getting confused about the spatial relationships.

Let's be more careful:

NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This means x completely contains y and there's some space between y and x's boundary.

TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This means z completely contains y and y touches z's boundary at some point.

Let's think about the possible configurations:

First, since y is completely inside both x and z, we know that x and z must overlap at least at y.

Next, since y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary, we know that z's boundary must be "closer in" than x's boundary, at least at some points.

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Not possible because x and z share y.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Not possible because x and z share y, which is an interior point of both.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This means x and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. This seems possible. y is in the overlapping region, y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is completely inside x and touches z's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, it's not clear to me how x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. It seems like there's a contradiction here. Actually, thinking about it more, I don't think this is possible. If y touches z's boundary and y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), then x must extend beyond the point where y touches z's boundary. But if x is a tangential proper part of z, then x would touch z's boundary but be completely inside z. These two conditions seem to be in conflict.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: This would mean x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But we know y touches z's boundary, and y is completely inside x. So x must also touch or extend beyond z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary, for z to be completely inside x, z's boundary must be between y and x's boundary. This seems possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: This would mean z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But given that y touches z's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, for z to not touch x's boundary, z must be between y and x's boundary. But if z doesn't touch x's boundary, then there must be some space between z's boundary and x's boundary. However, y touches z's boundary and y is strictly inside x. This creates a contradiction. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. But we know y touches z's boundary and doesn't touch x's boundary. So x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, I'm still not sure about my analysis. Let me try drawing some diagrams mentally.

Let me clarify the spatial relationships step by step.

1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. So x contains y, and y doesn't touch x's boundary.

2. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So z contains y, and y touches z's boundary.

Now let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): This would mean x and z don't share any points. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the region y. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) (Externally Connected): This would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping): This would mean x and z share some points, but neither is completely contained in the other. This seems possible. y would be in the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part): This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

   Let's carefully think about this. We know y is part of x and y touches z's boundary. So x must also touch z's boundary at the same point. But if x is completely inside z, then all of x's boundary must be touching or inside z's boundary. Since y is inside x (not touching x's boundary), there must be some distance between y and x's boundary. But y also touches z's boundary. If all of x's boundary is touching or inside z's boundary, and y is inside x not touching x's boundary, then y cannot touch z's boundary. This creates a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (Non-tangential Proper Part): This would mean x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But as we just discussed, y touches z's boundary and is inside x. So x must also touch z's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (Inverse Tangential Proper Part): This would mean z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. This seems possible. y is inside z, and z is inside x. y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (Inverse Non-tangential Proper Part): This would mean z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This also seems possible. z would be between y and x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) (Equal): This would mean x and z are the same region. But we know y touches z's boundary and doesn't touch x's boundary. So x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I'm now more confident, but just to be sure, let me carefully reconsider TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z), I think there's an issue with my reasoning.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since y is inside x and y touches z's boundary, x also touches z's boundary at the same point. This doesn't seem to create a contradiction. It's possible for x to be completely inside z, with a portion of x touching z's boundary, and y inside x also touching z's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) seems possible.

For NTPP(x,z), I think my reasoning is correct.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. But since y is inside x and y touches z's boundary, x must also touch or extend beyond z's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me rethink this once more. Actually, I think I should look at the specific defining axioms of NTPPi and TPP:

NTPPi(x,y) means: 
1. y is a proper part of x (all of y is contained in x, and y is not equal to x)
2. y does not touch the boundary of x (y is strictly inside x)

TPP(y,z) means:
1. y is a proper part of z (all of y is contained in z, and y is not equal to z)
2. y touches the boundary of z (at least one point of y is on the boundary of z)

So, we have:
- All of y is contained in x, and y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- All of y is contained in z, and y touches z's boundary

Let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): This would mean x and z don't share any points. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the region y. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) (Externally Connected): This would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping): This would mean x and z share some points, but neither is completely contained in the other. This seems possible. y would be in the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part): This would mean all of x is contained in z, and x touches z's boundary.

   We know y is inside x (not touching x's boundary) and y touches z's boundary. If all of x is inside z, and y touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary. This doesn't create a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

   Actually, let me think about this more carefully. If y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, and x is a proper part of z, that means there's a point p on y that is also on z's boundary. But p is not on x's boundary. So p is in the interior of x. But if p is on z's boundary and x is a proper part of z, then p should also be on x's boundary or outside of x. This creates a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (Non-tangential Proper Part): This would mean all of x is contained in z and x doesn't touch z's boundary. But as we just discussed, y touches z's boundary and is inside x. So x must also touch z's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (Inverse Tangential Proper Part): This would mean all of z is contained in x and z touches x's boundary. This seems possible. y is inside z, and z is inside x. y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (Inverse Non-tangential Proper Part): This would mean all of z is contained in x and z doesn't touch x's boundary. This also seems possible. z would be between y and x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) (Equal): This would mean x and z are the same region. But we know y touches z's boundary and doesn't touch x's boundary. So x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I'm struggling to reason about TPP(x,z) because I'm getting confused about the boundaries.

Let's actually ask: Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), can we have TPP(x,z)?

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
TPP(x,z) would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

If y touches z's boundary, then there's a point p on y that is also on z's boundary. If y doesn't touch x's boundary, then p is in the interior of x. But if x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then the only part of x that can touch z's boundary is x's boundary. But p is in the interior of x, not on x's boundary. This creates a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I'm now confident in my analysis.

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping)
2. TPPi(x,z) (Inverse Tangential Proper Part)
3. NTPPi(x,z) (Inverse Non-tangential Proper Part)

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning. I think the issue is that I'm not properly keeping track of what's in the interior vs. boundary of a region.

Let's start again:

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So all of y is in the interior of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. So all of y is in z, and at least one point of y is on z's boundary.

Now, for TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x would have to be in z, and at least one point of x would have to be on z's boundary.

We know y is inside x and y touches z's boundary. So there's at least one point of y that's on z's boundary. But since y is inside x, this point is also part of x. So x also touches z's boundary.

For x to be a proper part of z, all of x would have to be inside z. Since y is inside x, that would mean all of y is inside z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z).

So it seems like TPP(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I need to be careful about tangentiality. Let's be precise:

NTPPi(x,y) means all of y is in the interior of x (not on x's boundary).
TPP(y,z) means all of y is in z, and at least one point of y is on z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x would have to be in z, and at least one point of x would have to be on z's boundary.

Since y is in the interior of x, all of y's points are in the interior of x, not on x's boundary. But if a point of y is on z's boundary, that point is both in the interior of x and on z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x would have to be in z, and x would touch z's boundary only at x's boundary. But we have a point that's both on z's boundary and in the interior of x. This seems to create a contradiction.

Let's look at it spatially. Imagine concentric circles: z is the largest circle, x is inside it, and y is inside x. TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary. NTPPi(x,y) means y doesn't touch x's boundary. So y is inside x, not touching x's boundary, but y touches z's boundary. This means z's boundary must be inside x or touching x's boundary. But for TPP(x,z) to hold, x would have to be inside z, touching z's boundary.

I'm still struggling to visualize this clearly. Let's think of an example:

Imagine x is a circle of radius 10, y is a circle of radius 8 with the same center as x, and z is a circle of radius 9 that's shifted so that y touches z's boundary. In this case, y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), and y is inside z and touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)). But x is not inside z; they overlap (PO(x,z)).

Ah, I see the problem now. For y to touch z's boundary while being inside x, z's boundary must cut through x. This means x is not entirely inside z, which contradicts TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

I think my initial analysis was correct:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping)
2. TPPi(x,z) (Inverse Tangential Proper Part)
3. NTPPi(x,z) (Inverse Non-tangential Proper Part)

Let's double-check each of these:

1. PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. This seems possible. y is in the overlapping region, y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.

2. TPPi(x,z): This means z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. This seems possible. z's boundary would be between y and x's boundary, with y touching z's boundary.

3. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But if y touches z's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is completely inside x, then z's boundary must be between y and x's boundary. So z would touch x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I'm still second-guessing myself about NTPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z would be inside x and wouldn't touch x's boundary.

Given that y touches z's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z's boundary would have to be between y and x's boundary.

But wait, that would mean z's boundary approaches x's boundary, which contradicts the non-tangentiality of NTPPi(x,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let me try another approach to be sure. In the RCC-8 calculus, the composition of two relations can be determined by a composition table. Let's try to derive the composition of NTPPi and TPP.

Actually, I don't recall exactly, but the RCC-8 composition table should tell us what relations are possible between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Without the composition table at hand, I'll continue with my spatial reasoning.

Again, we have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

For PO(x,z), x and z would share some points (at least y), but neither would be completely contained in the other. This seems possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. This also seems possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. Given that y touches z's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, for z to be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary, z's boundary would have to be somewhere between y and x's boundary. But if y touches z's boundary, and z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary, there would be a gap between z's boundary and x's boundary. This seems possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me double-check. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary, then y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This matches NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is consistent with our given relations.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping)
2. TPPi(x,z) (Inverse Tangential Proper Part)
3. NTPPi(x,z) (Inverse Non-tangential Proper Part)

Actually, I think I was confused earlier. NTPPi(x,z) is possible. Let me be careful:

NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z would be inside x and wouldn't touch x's boundary.

If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which matches NTPPi(x,y).

If y touches z's boundary, that's consistent with TPP(y,z).

So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping)
2. TPPi(x,z) (Inverse Tangential Proper Part)
3. NTPPi(x,z) (Inverse Non-tangential Proper Part)

Actually, let me just verify EQ(x,z) one more time.

EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y touches z's boundary, then y would touch x's boundary. But we're given NTPPi(x,y), which means y doesn't touch x's boundary. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

And let's double-check NTPP(x,z) and TPP(x,z) again:

NTPP(x,z) would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If y is inside x and y touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z) would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If y is inside x and y touches z's boundary, then x also touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) could be possible.

But there's a problem. We know y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, then y must be touching z's boundary at a point where x also touches z's boundary. But since y is inside x, if y touches z's boundary, it does so at a point that's inside x. For x to also touch z's boundary at this point, this point would have to be on x's boundary. But we know y doesn't touch x's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

So my final analysis is:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping)
2. TPPi(x,z) (Inverse Tangential Proper Part)
3. NTPPi(x,z) (Inverse Non-tangential Proper Part)

This seems to be my final answer.

Actually, wait. Let me try to see if I can construct a concrete example for each of these relations.

1. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping):
   Imagine x is a circle of radius 10, y is a circle of radius 7 concentric with x, and z is a circle of radius 8 that's shifted so that y touches z's boundary. In this case, x and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary. So this example satisfies PO(x,z).

2. TPPi(x,z) (Inverse Tangential Proper Part):
   Imagine x is a circle of radius 10, z is a circle of radius 8 concentric with x, and y is a circle of radius 7 that's shifted so that y touches z's boundary. In this case, z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary. So this example satisfies TPPi(x,z).

3. NTPPi(x,z) (Inverse Non-tangential Proper Part):
   Imagine x is a circle of radius 10, z is a circle of radius 7 concentric with x, and y is a circle of radius 5 that's shifted so that y touches z's boundary. In this case, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary. So this example satisfies NTPPi(x,z).

I think these examples confirm that PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are all possible given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

But wait, there's a problem with my first example for PO(x,z). If y has radius 7 and z has radius 8, and y touches z's boundary, then the center of y can be at most 1 unit away from the center of z. But if x has radius 10 and is concentric with y, then the center of x is also at most 1 unit away from the center of z. Given that the radius of z is 8 and the radius of x is 10, x must contain z entirely. So PO(x,z) wouldn't hold; instead, TPPi(x,z) would hold.

Let me revise my example for PO(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin, y is a circle of radius 5 centered at (0, 0), and z is a circle of radius 6 centered at (4, 0). In this case, y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary. x and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. So this example satisfies PO(x,z).

Similarly, there's a problem with my example for TPPi(x,z). If z has radius 8 and y has radius 7, and y touches z's boundary, then the center of y can be at most 1 unit away from the center of z. If z is concentric with x, and z has radius 8 and x has radius 10, then z touches x's boundary. But if the center of y is at most 1 unit away from the center of z, and z is concentric with x, then y would be at most 1 unit away from the center of x. Given that y has radius 7 and x has radius 10, y would touch x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y).

Let me revise my example for TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin, z is a circle of radius 5 centered at (5, 0), and y is a circle of radius 2 centered at (3, 0). In this case, z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z) holds. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,y) holds. y is inside z and touches z's boundary, so TPP(y,z) holds.

Hmm, that doesn't work either. If z is centered at (5, 0) with radius 5, it would extend from (0, 0) to (10, 0), touching the boundary of x (which is centered at the origin with radius 10). But if y is centered at (3, 0) with radius 2, it would extend from (1, 0) to (5, 0). So y would touch the boundary of z at (5, 0), but it would be 1 unit away from the boundary of x at (1, 0), which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y).

But there's a problem: if z extends from (0, 0) to (10, 0), and y extends from (1, 0) to (5, 0), then the point (0, 0) is in z but not in y. This contradicts the assumption that y is a proper part of z (TPP(y,z)).

Let me try a different example:
Imagine x is a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin, z is a circle of radius 5 centered at (5, 0), and y is a circle of radius 2 centered at (3, 0). In this case, z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z) holds. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,y) holds.

But now I'm not sure about TPP(y,z). For TPP(y,z) to hold, y must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. If z is centered at (5, 0) with radius 5, it extends from (0, 0) to (10, 0). If y is centered at (3, 0) with radius 2, it extends from (1, 0) to (5, 0). So y touches the boundary of z at (5, 0), but the point (0, 0) is in z but not in y. So y is not a proper part of z, which contradicts TPP(y,z).

I'm getting confused because I'm trying to construct examples with circles, which have circular boundaries. Let me try a different approach with rectangles.

Actually, let me reconsider the definition of a proper part again. A region y is a proper part of region z if all points of y are in z, and there's at least one point of z that's not in y. So for TPP(y,z), all of y must be in z, and y must touch z's boundary.

Let me try again:
Imagine x is a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin, z is a circle of radius 8 centered at the origin, and y is a circle of radius 6 centered at (2, 0). In this case, y is inside x (the distance from the center of y to the center of x is 2, and the radius of y is 6, so the boundary of y is 2 units away from the boundary of x), so NTPPi(x,y) holds. y is inside z (the distance from the center of y to the center of z is 2, and the radius of z is 8, so the boundary of z is 2 units away from the center of y), and y touches z's boundary (the distance from the center of y to the center of z is 2, the radius of y is 6, and the radius of z is 8, so the boundary of y is 2 units away from the boundary of z), so TPP(y,z) holds. z is inside x and touches x's boundary (the radius of x is 10 and the radius of z is 8, so the boundary of z is 2 units away from the boundary of x), so TPPi(x,z) holds.

Actually, I'm getting confused again. If z is centered at the origin with radius 8, and y is centered at (2, 0) with radius 6, then the distance from the center of y to the boundary of z in the positive x direction is 8 - 2 = 6, which is equal to the radius of y. So y touches the boundary of z. But the distance from the center of y to the boundary of z in the negative x direction is 2 + 8 = 10, which is greater than the radius of y (6). So y doesn't completely touch the boundary of z, but it touches the boundary of z at one point. I think this still satisfies TPP(y,z).

And now I realize there's an issue with my previous reasoning. TPP(y,z) doesn't mean y touches z's boundary everywhere; it just means y touches z's boundary somewhere. So my example should work:
Imagine x is a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin, z is a circle of radius 8 centered at the origin, and y is a circle of radius 6 centered at (2, 0). In this case, y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,y) holds. y is inside z and touches z's boundary, so TPP(y,z) holds. z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

Wait, that's not right. If z has radius 8 and x has radius 10, and they're concentric, then the boundary of z is 2 units away from the boundary of x. So z doesn't touch x's boundary, which means TPPi(x,z) doesn't hold; instead, NTPPi(x,z) holds.

Let me try again for TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin, z is a circle of radius 9 centered at the origin, and y is a circle of radius 6 centered at (3, 0). In this case, y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,y) holds. y is inside z and touches z's boundary, so TPP(y,z) holds. z is inside x and touches x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z) holds.

Actually, if z has radius 9 and is centered at the origin, and y has radius 6 and is centered at (3, 0), then the distance from the center of y to the boundary of z in the positive x direction is 9 - 3 = 6, which is equal to the radius of y. So y touches the boundary of z. But the distance from the center of y to the center of x is 3, and the radius of y is 6, so the boundary of y is 10 - 3 - 6 = 1 unit away from the boundary of x. So y doesn't touch x's boundary, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y).

So these examples support that both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.

Now, let's try to construct an example for PO(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin, z is a circle of radius 8 centered at (7, 0), and y is a circle of radius 4 centered at (3, 0). In this case, y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,y) holds. y is inside z and touches z's boundary, so TPP(y,z) holds. x and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other, so PO(x,z) holds.

But wait, if z is centered at (7, 0) with radius 8, it extends from (-1, 0) to (15, 0). If y is centered at (3, 0) with radius 4, it extends from (-1, 0) to (7, 0). So y touches the boundary of z, but it's not clear that y is a proper part of z.

Let's try a different example:
Imagine x is a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin, z is a circle of radius 8 centered at (6, 0), and y is a circle of radius 5 centered at (2, 0). In this case, y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,y) holds. The distance from the center of y to the center of z is 4, the radius of y is 5, and the radius of z is 8. So the boundary of y is 8 - 4 - 5 = -1 unit away from the boundary of z, which means y extends 1 unit beyond the boundary of z in the negative x direction. So y is not a proper part of z, which contradicts TPP(y,z).

Let me try again:
Imagine x is a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin, z is a circle of radius 8 centered at (4, 0), and y is a circle of radius 3 centered at (1, 0). In this case, y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,y) holds. The distance from the center of y to the center of z is 3, the radius of y is 3, and the radius of z is 8. So the boundary of y is 8 - 3 - 3 = 2 units away from the boundary of z in the positive x direction, which means y doesn't touch the boundary of z. So TPP(y,z) doesn't hold.

Let me try again:
Imagine x is a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin, z is a circle of radius 7 centered at (8, 0), and y is a circle of radius 4 centered at (5, 0). In this case, y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,y) holds. The distance from the center of y to the center of z is 3, the radius of y is 4, and the radius of z is 7. So the boundary of y is 7 - 3 - 4 = 0 units away from the boundary of z, which means y touches the boundary of z. The distance from the center of y to the center of x is 5, the radius of y is 4, and the radius of x is 10. So the boundary of y is 10 - 5 - 4 = 1 unit away from the boundary of x, which means y doesn't touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) both hold.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z. The distance from the center of x to the center of z is 8, the radius of x is 10, and the radius of z is 7. So the boundary of x is 10 - 8 - 7 = -5 units away from the boundary of z, which means x extends 5 units beyond the boundary of z in the negative x direction. So x and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other, which means PO(x,z) holds.

So, my examples support that PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are all possible given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

My final answer is:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping)
2. TPPi(x,z) (Inverse Tangential Proper Part)
3. NTPPi(x,z) (Inverse Non-tangential Proper Part)

ANSWER:

Let me work through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Now, what relationship could exist between x and z?

I'll analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Not possible because x and z must share at least region y.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Not possible because x and z share interior points (specifically y).

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Possible. x and z can overlap without either being completely contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: Not possible. If y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary, and x were completely inside z, this would create a contradiction.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: Not possible. Since y touches z's boundary and y is inside x, x must also touch z's boundary, which contradicts NTPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: Possible. z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: Not possible. Since y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, x and z cannot be identical.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
