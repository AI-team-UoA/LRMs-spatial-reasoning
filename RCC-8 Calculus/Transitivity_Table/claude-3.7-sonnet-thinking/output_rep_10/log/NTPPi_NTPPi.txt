PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's start by understanding what these relations mean.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is entirely contained within the interior of x, and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is entirely contained within the interior of y, and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So we have:
- y is entirely contained within the interior of x
- z is entirely contained within the interior of y

The question asks for the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about this carefully. If z is entirely contained within y, and y is entirely contained within x, then z must also be entirely contained within x. This means that z is a proper part of x.

Now, does z touch the boundary of x? Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y)), and y doesn't touch the boundary of x (from NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x)), it follows that z cannot touch the boundary of x. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Let's double-check this conclusion:
- We know that z is entirely contained within y.
- We know that y is entirely contained within x.
- Therefore, z is entirely contained within x.
- Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x.
- Thus, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me think about this more carefully. I want to be precise about the RCC-8 relations.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a proper part of x and does not share any points with the boundary of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y and does not share any points with the boundary of y.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of x (i.e., y is entirely contained within x) and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y (i.e., z is entirely contained within y) and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

If z is entirely contained within y, and y is entirely contained within x, then it follows that z is entirely contained within x. This means that z is a proper part of x.

Now, can z touch the boundary of x? Since z is entirely contained within y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more careful. RCC-8 has 8 exhaustive relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), what are the possible relationships between x and z?

We have established that z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This rules out DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ. It leaves only NTPP or NTPPi.

NTPP(x,z) would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But we've established that z is a proper part of x, so x cannot be a proper part of z. This rules out NTPP.

NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with our reasoning above. So NTPPi(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

Actually, let me double-check one more possibility: could we have EQ(x,z)?

EQ(x,z) would mean that x and z are identical. But we know that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. Since "proper part" means "part but not equal to", this implies that z is not equal to x. So EQ(x,z) is ruled out.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me recheck the definitions one more time to be absolutely sure.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that z is a proper part of x. And since z is entirely contained within y, which is entirely within the interior of x, z is also entirely within the interior of x. Thus, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I think NTPPi(x,z) is the final answer.

Actually, I just realized I have been overthinking this. The prompt already gives me the definitions of the 8 RCC-8 relations, which are pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive. Let me revisit those:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x), meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), meaning y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (the same).

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), let's see what that means:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is entirely within the interior of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is entirely within the interior of y.

So, z is entirely within the interior of y, and y is entirely within the interior of x. This means z is entirely within the interior of x, making z a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

The answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait a minute. Let me be more systematic. 

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we know:
- y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Let's consider all 8 possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean that x and z are disconnected. But we know that z is within y, and y is within x, so z must also be within x. This is a contradiction, so DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean that x and z touch at a boundary. But since z is within the interior of y, and y is within the interior of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean that x and z share a part, but neither is part of the other. However, we know that z is within y, and y is within x, so z is entirely within x. This contradicts the definition of PO, so PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z. But we've established that z is within x, not the other way around. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But we've established that z is within x, not the other way around. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is within x and touches the boundary of x. But since z is within the interior of y, and y is within the interior of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is entirely within the interior of x. This is consistent with our reasoning, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are the same region. But we know that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is smaller than x. This contradicts the definition of EQ, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, out of the 8 possible relations, only NTPPi(x,z) is consistent with the given information. Thus, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I'll double-check this with a specific example:
Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle entirely within x (not touching the boundary of x), and z as an even smaller circle entirely within y (not touching the boundary of y). Clearly, z is entirely within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This confirms that the relationship is indeed NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I'm actually being sloppy with my examples. Let me think about the constraints of RCC-8 more carefully.

In RCC-8, regions are non-empty regular closed sets, which means that they have no "holes" or "cracks". A proper part of a region is a region that is contained within the first region but is not equal to it.

So, let's imagine x as a large square, y as a smaller square entirely within the interior of x, and z as an even smaller square entirely within the interior of y. In this case, we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), and we can see that the relationship between x and z is indeed NTPPi(x,z), as z is entirely within the interior of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be even more careful. RCC stands for "Region Connection Calculus" and regions in RCC-8 are supposed to be non-empty regular closed sets, but the connections are defined based on whether the closures of the regions intersect. I won't get into the formal details since they aren't provided in the problem, but let me think this through one more time.

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we know:
- y is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means that y is within the interior of x.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means that z is within the interior of y.

From this, we can derive that z is within the interior of x, which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm confused myself. Let me just stick to the definitions provided in the problem statement:

- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), meaning y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

So, NTPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x but does not touch the boundary of x.
And NTPPi(y,z) means that z is part of y but does not touch the boundary of y.

From this, we can conclude that z is part of y, and y is part of x, so z is part of x. And since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, the relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

But wait a minute. There is an issue with my reasoning. Just because z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, doesn't necessarily mean that z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This would only be true if y "shields" z from the boundary of x, which requires that y surrounds z completely.

But the definition of NTPP says that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. This implies that x is completely within the interior of y, not just that some part of x is in the interior of y.

So, when we say NTPPi(x,y), it means that y is completely within the interior of x. And when we say NTPPi(y,z), it means that z is completely within the interior of y.

From this, we can indeed conclude that z is completely within the interior of x, which means NTPPi(x,z).

I think NTPPi(x,z) is the final answer.

Actually, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just use the definitions and reason step by step.

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is part of x but does not touch the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but does not touch the boundary of y.

So, z is part of y, and y is part of x. By the transitivity of the "part of" relation, z is part of x.

Now, does z touch the boundary of x? 
- We know that z does not touch the boundary of y.
- And y does not touch the boundary of x.
- Since z is inside y, and y is inside x (without touching its boundary), z is completely inside x (without touching its boundary).

Therefore, z is part of x but does not touch the boundary of x, which is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

The relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, a few moments ago I was getting confused about whether this is necessarily the case (whether z not touching the boundary of y, and y not touching the boundary of x, implies that z doesn't touch the boundary of x). But it is, and I was right the first time. Let me explain why:

Imagine z as a small region inside y, and y as a region inside x. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, there's a "buffer zone" of y surrounding z. Similarly, since y doesn't touch the boundary of x, there's a "buffer zone" of x surrounding y. This means that z is surrounded by a "double buffer" and cannot touch the boundary of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is indeed NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me give a simple argument. I'm given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). Then we have NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(z,y). By definition NTPP(y,x) means that y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similarly, NTPP(z,y) means that z is part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. We can infer that z is a part of x by transitivity of the "part of" relation. So z is part of x. Moreover, z is entirely contained within y, and y is entirely contained within the interior of x, which means that z is entirely contained within the interior of x. Thus, z is part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me make absolutely sure I understand the definitions correctly. The problem states:

NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), meaning y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

So, NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a subset of x and y doesn't touch the boundary of x.
And NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a subset of y and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

From this, we can say that z is a subset of y, and y is a subset of x, so z is a subset of x. 

Now, does z touch the boundary of x? Since z is a subset of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z also doesn't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a subset of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, maybe there's a slight oversight in my reasoning. Let me try to be very explicit. We have 8 pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is completely within the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means that z is completely within the interior of y, not touching the boundary of y.

Visually, imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle entirely within x (not touching the boundary of x), and z as an even smaller circle entirely within y (not touching the boundary of y).

Now, let's consider all 8 possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean that x and z are disconnected. But z is within y, and y is within x, so z is within x, which means they are connected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean that x and z touch at a boundary. But z is within the interior of y, which is within the interior of x, so z cannot touch the boundary of x. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean that x and z share a part, but neither is part of the other. But z is entirely within x, so z is part of x. This contradicts the definition of PO, so PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z. But z is within x, not the other way around. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But z is within x, not the other way around. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is within x and touches the boundary of x. But z is within the interior of y, which is within the interior of x, so z cannot touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is entirely within the interior of x. This is consistent with our reasoning, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are the same region. But z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is smaller than x. This contradicts the definition of EQ, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

From this exhaustive analysis, we can confidently say that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

The answer is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), I need to analyze what these relations tell us:

First, let's understand what we know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary (y is completely within the interior of x)
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary (z is completely within the interior of y)

From these facts:
1. Since z is completely within the interior of y, and y is completely within the interior of x, it follows that z must be completely within the interior of x.
2. z is definitely part of x (by transitivity of the "part of" relation)
3. z cannot touch the boundary of x, since it doesn't even touch the boundary of y, which itself doesn't touch the boundary of x

Let me check this against all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:
- DC(x,z): Impossible, since z is within x
- EC(x,z): Impossible, since z doesn't touch x's boundary
- PO(x,z): Impossible, since z is completely contained in x
- TPP(x,z): Impossible, since x isn't part of z
- NTPP(x,z): Impossible, since x isn't part of z
- TPPi(x,z): Impossible, since z doesn't touch x's boundary
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible, since z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- EQ(x,z): Impossible, since z is smaller than x

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
