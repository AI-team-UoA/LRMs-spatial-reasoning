PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the information:

1. TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which in turn means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

So, we have:
- x is a tangential proper part of y (touches y's boundary)
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y (fully contained within y, not touching the boundary)

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: 
   Can x and z be completely disconnected? If both x and z are parts of y, they are at least within the same region. However, they might not overlap. But if z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, while x is a part of y and touches the boundary, then x and z could be disconnected within y. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: 
   Can x and z touch at a boundary? z doesn't touch the boundary of y, but it could touch the boundary of x. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlap: 
   Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can share a part, but neither is fully contained within the other. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: 
   Can x be a tangential proper part of z? If x is a part of y and touches the boundary of y, and z is a part of y without touching the boundary of y, then x cannot be a tangential proper part of z. Because if x is a part of z, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of y (since z doesn't). So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Wait, let me think about this more carefully.

x is a tangential proper part of y (touches y's boundary).
z is a non-tangential proper part of y (fully contained within y, not touching the boundary).

Actually, it seems that if x touches the boundary of y, and z doesn't, then x can't be completely inside z. Because if x is inside z, and z is inside y without touching the boundary, then x would also be inside y without touching the boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: 
   Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? If x is a part of y and touches the boundary of y, and z is a part of y without touching the boundary of y, then x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z for the same reason as above. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: 
   Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This means that z is a part of x and touches the boundary of x. Since z is fully contained within y without touching the boundary of y, it could be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: 
   Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be fully contained within x without touching the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: 
   Can x and z be the same region? If x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, they can't be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me carefully go over these possibilities again to make sure I'm not making a mistake:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: x and z don't share any spatial parts.
If x is a tangential proper part of y, it means x is fully contained within y but touches y's boundary.
If z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given these, x and z are both within y, but they could be in different "areas" of y, not sharing any spatial parts. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
Again, x and z are both within y, but they could just touch at a boundary. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlap: x and z share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained within the other.
This is also possible. x and z could overlap within y without one being fully inside the other. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
Here, I think I made a mistake earlier. If x is a tangential proper part of y, it doesn't mean every part of x touches the boundary of y; it means x has at least one point that touches the boundary of y. So, theoretically, x could be fully contained within z and still have a part that touches the boundary of y.

However, if z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If x is fully contained within z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, then x wouldn't touch y's boundary either. This contradicts the fact that x is a tangential proper part of y. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
For the same reasons as in the TPP case, if x is contained within z, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of y. This contradicts the fact that x is a tangential proper part of y. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
This is possible. z could be fully contained within x and touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
This is also possible. z could be fully contained within x without touching the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: x and z are the same region.
If x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, they can't be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Hmm, I think I need to double-check these possibilities again to make sure I'm being consistent.

Let's re-examine the constraints:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y at some point.
2. NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Wait, I think I've been misinterpreting NTPPi(y,z). Let's clarify:
- NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y).
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, we have:
- x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y at some point.
- y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given these constraints, let's reanalyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: 
   If y is fully contained within z, and x is fully contained within y, then x is also fully contained within z. So, x and z cannot be disconnected. DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: 
   If x is inside z, they can't just touch at the boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlap: 
   If x is inside z, they don't just partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is not a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: 
   If x is inside z, it could touch the boundary of z. But, if y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x is fully contained within y, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of z either. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. If x touches the boundary of y, and y is inside z but doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. 

Let me start again and be more careful with the visualization:

1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. 
   This means x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y at some point.

2. NTPPi(y,z): NTPP(z,y).
   No, that's not right. NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. 
   This means y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, we have:
- x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y at some point.
- y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given these constraints, let's reanalyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: 
   If y is fully contained within z, and x is fully contained within y, then x is also fully contained within z. So, x and z cannot be disconnected. DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: 
   If x is inside z, they can't just touch at the boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlap: 
   If x is inside z, they don't just partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is not a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: 
   If x is inside z, it could touch the boundary of z. 

   But, if y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y, then x is inside z and, at most, touches the boundary of y. Since y doesn't touch the boundary of z, x cannot touch the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: 
   If x is inside z but doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. 

   Given that y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x is fully contained within y, it means x is also fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Hang on, let me rethink this. If x touches the boundary of y, and y is strictly inside z, then x is inside z but doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is the relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: 
   This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, which is not possible given the constraints. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: 
   This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is not possible given the constraints. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: 
   If x is inside y and y is inside z, then x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Alright, after a more careful analysis, it seems the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). 

Actually, wait. Let's think about this again. I think I was right the first time.

- TPP(x,y): x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y at some point.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given these, we know that y is inside z, and x is inside y. So, by transitivity of "inside", x is inside z. Additionally, since y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x is inside y, x also doesn't touch the boundary of z. Thus, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which is NTPP(x,z).

But let me think about this more carefully one more time:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y at some point.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which in turn means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

No, that's not right. NTPPi(y,z) doesn't mean NTPP(z,y). NTPPi is the inverse of NTPP, which means:
NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y)

So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So, we have:
- x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y at some point.
- z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these constraints, x and z are both inside y. But x touches the boundary of y, while z doesn't. So, they can be in various spatial relationships. They can be:

1. DC(x,z): If they don't share any spatial parts.
2. EC(x,z): If they touch at a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): If they partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

They can't be:
1. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x would be inside z. But if z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and x is inside z, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of y either. This contradicts the fact that x is a tangential proper part of y.
2. NTPP(x,z): For the same reason as TPP.
3. EQ(x,z): If x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, they can't be the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Hmm, I think I was right the first time, but then I made an error in my interpretation of NTPPi. Let me go through this one more time:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y at some point.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which in turn means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So, we have:
- x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y at some point.
- z is fully contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these constraints, x and z are both inside y. But x touches the boundary of y, while z doesn't. So, they can be in various spatial relationships. They can be:

1. DC(x,z): If they don't share any spatial parts.
2. EC(x,z): If they touch at a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): If they partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

They can't be:
1. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x would be inside z. But if z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and x is inside z, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of y either. This contradicts the fact that x is a tangential proper part of y.
2. NTPP(x,z): For the same reason as TPP.
3. EQ(x,z): If x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, they can't be the same region.

Actually, I think I got my interpretations wrong. In the context of RCC-8:

- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x does not touch the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y does not touch the boundary of x.

So:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Given these:
- x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y.
- z is fully contained within y but doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected within y. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.
2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at a boundary. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z? Let's think about this. If x is inside z and touches the boundary of z, and z is inside y but doesn't touch the boundary of y, then x would also be inside y. But x touches the boundary of y, while z doesn't. This would mean that x can touch parts of the boundary of y that z doesn't, which contradicts the assumption that x is inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z? Similar to the TPP case, if x is inside z and z is inside y but doesn't touch the boundary of y, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of y either. But we know x touches the boundary of y. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x? This means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible. z can be contained within x and touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a non-tangential proper part of x? This means z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is also possible. z can be fully contained within x without touching the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z can be the same region? If x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, they can't be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Alright, after a careful analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

I think I was getting confused because I was trying to reason through based on the formal definitions of the relations, but I was also trying to visualize them at the same time, which made me doubt myself. Let me just make sure I understand the RCC-8 relations correctly:

- DC(x,y): x and y don't share any spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained within the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Thinking it through again, x and z are both contained within y. However, x touches the boundary of y, while z doesn't. This means they can be:

1. DC(x,z): They can be in different parts of y without overlapping.
2. EC(x,z): They can touch at a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): They can partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z can be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a proper part of x and not touch the boundary of x.

They can't be:
1. TPP(x,z): If x is inside z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of y either. This contradicts the fact that x touches the boundary of y.
2. NTPP(x,z): For the same reason as TPP.
3. EQ(x,z): If x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, they can't be the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I feel like I should double check the relation NTPPi(y,z) to make sure I'm thinking of it correctly. NTPPi is the inverse of NTPP. So, NTPPi(y,z) means that y is not a non-tangential proper part of z. But that doesn't mean y is not a part of z; it means the opposite. y could be a tangential proper part of z, or it could be equal to z, or some other relation.

No, wait. NTPPi(y,z) means the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which is NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is inside y but doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Let's be completely clear about the given information:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So, we have:
- x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
- z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these, x and z are both contained within y. However, x touches the boundary of y, while z doesn't. This means they can be:

1. DC(x,z): They can be in different parts of y without overlapping.
2. EC(x,z): They can touch at a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): They can partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z can be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a proper part of x and not touch the boundary of x.

They can't be:
1. TPP(x,z): If x is inside z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of y either. This contradicts the fact that x touches the boundary of y.
2. NTPP(x,z): For the same reason as TPP.
3. EQ(x,z): If x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, they can't be the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let me double check this once more to be sure. 

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: x and z are both inside y but can be in different parts without overlapping. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: x and z can touch at a boundary without overlapping. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlap: x and z can share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained within the other. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is fully contained within z and touches the boundary of z. If z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, and x is inside z, then x is also inside y. But, if x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, then x can't be inside z (because if x is inside z and z doesn't touch the boundary of y, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of y either). So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is fully contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Similar to the TPP case, if z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and x is inside z, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of y either. This contradicts the fact that x is a tangential proper part of y. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Z can be inside x and touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Z can be inside x without touching the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: If x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, they can't be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let me go through this once more, carefully:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: x and z don't share any parts.
   Both x and z are inside y. It's possible for them to be in different parts of y without overlapping. For example, if y is a big circle, x could be a small circle touching the boundary of y, and z could be another small circle in the middle of y. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: x and z touch at a boundary.
   Again, both x and z are inside y. It's possible for them to touch at a boundary without overlapping. For example, if y is a big circle, x could be a small circle touching the boundary of y, and z could be another small circle touching x but not touching the boundary of y. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlap: x and z share a part, but neither is fully inside the other.
   Both x and z are inside y. It's possible for them to partially overlap. For example, if y is a big circle, x could be a small circle touching the boundary of y, and z could be another small circle that partially overlaps with x but doesn't touch the boundary of y. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: x is inside z and touches the boundary of z.
   If x is inside z, and z is inside y but doesn't touch the boundary of y, then x would also be inside y without touching the boundary. But we know x touches the boundary of y. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   Similar to the TPP case, if x is inside z, and z is inside y but doesn't touch the boundary of y, then x wouldn't touch the boundary of y either. But we know x does touch the boundary of y. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
   Both x and z are inside y. It's possible for z to be inside x and touch the boundary of x. For example, if y is a big circle, x could be a smaller circle touching the boundary of y, and z could be an even smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
   Both x and z are inside y. It's possible for z to be inside x without touching the boundary of x. For example, if y is a big circle, x could be a smaller circle touching the boundary of y, and z could be an even smaller circle fully inside x without touching the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: x and z are the same region.
   If x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, they can't be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, based on this careful analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Just to be even more thorough, let me draw out all of these scenarios in my head:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   y is a big circle. x is a small circle at the edge of y, touching the boundary of y. z is another small circle in the middle of y, not touching the boundary of y or x. x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   y is a big circle. x is a small circle at the edge of y, touching the boundary of y. z is another small circle touching x, but not touching the boundary of y. x and z touch at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlap:
   y is a big circle. x is a small circle at the edge of y, touching the boundary of y. z is another small circle that partially overlaps with x, but doesn't touch the boundary of y. x and z partially overlap.

4. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse:
   y is a big circle. x is a smaller circle at the edge of y, touching the boundary of y. z is an even smaller circle inside x, touching the boundary of x but not touching the boundary of y. z is a tangential proper part of x.

5. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse:
   y is a big circle. x is a smaller circle at the edge of y, touching the boundary of y. z is an even smaller circle fully inside x, not touching the boundary of x or the boundary of y. z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Therefore, my final answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to analyze the possible spatial relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y - so x is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y - so z is completely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

Given these conditions, both x and z are contained within y, but x touches the boundary of y while z doesn't. Let me determine all possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): They can be completely disconnected regions within y.
2. EC(x,z): They can touch at a boundary without overlapping.
3. PO(x,z): They can partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x (contained in x and touching x's boundary).
5. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a non-tangential proper part of x (fully contained in x without touching x's boundary).

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because:
- If x were contained in z, x couldn't touch y's boundary (since z doesn't touch y's boundary)
- If x and z were identical, they would have the same relationship with y's boundary

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
