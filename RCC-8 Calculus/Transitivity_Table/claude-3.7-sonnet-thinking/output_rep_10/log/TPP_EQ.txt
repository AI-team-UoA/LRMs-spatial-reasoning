PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We are given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are identical in terms of their spatial extent. This means that any spatial relationship that holds between x and y will also hold between x and z.

Given that TPP(x,y), we know x is a tangential proper part of y. Since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is:
TPP(x,z)

Let me double-check this by considering the properties of these relations:

- TPP(x,y) means x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z occupy exactly the same space.

If y and z occupy exactly the same space, then:
- x is properly contained in z (because x is properly contained in y)
- x touches z's boundary (because x touches y's boundary, and y and z have identical boundaries)

This confirms that TPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

The answer is: TPP(x,z)

Actually, let me verify this is correct by considering the formal properties of RCC-8 relations.

RCC-8 relations have composition tables that tell us what relations are possible between x and z given relations between x and y and y and z.

For the composition of TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the result is straightforward:

If EQ(y,z), then y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent. So any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Since TPP(x,y) holds, we must have TPP(x,z) as well.

So the answer is: TPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to find what relationship holds between x and z given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space with identical boundaries.

Since y and z are exactly the same spatial region (EQ(y,z)), and x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
