PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step about what NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) mean, and then determine the possible relationships between x and z.

NTPPi(x,y) means the same as NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
- y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary

What can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations and see which ones are consistent with the given constraints:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know y is inside both x and z, so they must share at least the part where y is located. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. However, since y is in the interior of both x and z, x and z must share interior points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). This is possible if y is inside x, and x is inside z, with x touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary). This is possible if y is inside x, and x is completely inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). This is possible if y is inside z, and z is inside x, with z touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). This seems problematic, because if y is inside z, and z is completely inside x, then y cannot touch z's boundary. But we know from NTPP(y,z) that y doesn't touch z's boundary, so this is actually consistent. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space). This seems problematic because if y is properly inside both x and z, and x and z are the same, then y would have to be properly inside itself, which doesn't make sense. But upon further reflection, there's no contradiction here. If x and z are the same region, and y is properly inside this region, then both NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z) hold, which is consistent with our given constraints. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Upon further reflection, I think I made an error in my reasoning for TPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider:

For TPPi(x,z), we have z is inside x and touches x's boundary. From NTPP(y,z), we know y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means y is even more deeply nested inside x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

But I think I need to re-evaluate the PO(x,z) case as well. In PO(x,z), x and z overlap partially. But from NTPPi(x,y) we know y is entirely inside x, and from NTPP(y,z) we know y is entirely inside z. This means x and z must overlap at least in the area where y is located. Is this sufficient to say PO(x,z) is possible? PO(x,z) requires that neither x is part of z, nor z is part of x. Given the constraints, it's indeed possible for x and z to overlap without one being entirely contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

Hmm, let me re-analyze TPP(x,z) as well:

For TPP(x,z), x is inside z and touches z's boundary. From NTPPi(x,y), y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. From NTPP(y,z), y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means y is inside both x and z, which is consistent. Since x touches z's boundary, y must be away from z's boundary, which is also consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Finally, let's re-analyze NTPP(x,z):

For NTPP(x,z), x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. From NTPPi(x,y), y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. From NTPP(y,z), y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means y is inside both x and z, which is consistent. Since x doesn't touch z's boundary, y is even farther from z's boundary, which is also consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

But let me double-check my reasoning by tracing through each case carefully:

1. PO(x,z): In this case, x and z overlap, but neither is fully contained in the other. Is this consistent with y being fully inside both x and z? Yes, y can be in the overlapping region of x and z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): In this case, x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. Is this consistent with y being fully inside both x and z? Yes, y can be fully inside x, which is in turn fully inside z. And since y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), it certainly doesn't touch z's boundary, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): In this case, x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Is this consistent with y being fully inside both x and z? Yes, y can be fully inside x, which is in turn fully inside z without touching z's boundary. And since y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), it certainly doesn't touch z's boundary, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): In this case, z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary. Is this consistent with y being fully inside both x and z? Let's see. Since y is fully inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), and z is fully inside x, then y is indeed fully inside x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). But here's a potential issue: if z touches x's boundary, can y still not touch x's boundary (as required by NTPPi(x,y))? Yes, this is still consistent because y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), and z only touches x's boundary at specific points, so y still remains entirely in the interior of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): In this case, z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Is this consistent with y being fully inside both x and z? Yes, if y is fully inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), and z is fully inside x without touching x's boundary, then y is definitely fully inside x without touching x's boundary, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. EQ(x,z): In this case, x and z are the same region. Is this consistent with y being fully inside both x and z? Yes, if x and z are the same, then saying y is fully inside x and fully inside z is saying the same thing. And the conditions that y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)) are also saying the same thing. Wait, but there's a contradiction here. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is a non-tangential proper part of x. And NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x and z are the same (EQ(x,z)), then NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z) are saying the same thing. But we were given NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), and NTPP(y,z). If x and z are the same, then we'd have both NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z), which is consistent. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Upon checking my work more carefully, I realized I was conflating NTPPi(x,y) with NTPP(x,y). Let me clarify:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's redo the analysis:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know y is inside both x and z, so they must share at least the part where y is located. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. However, since y is in the interior of both x and z, x and z must share interior points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Given that y is inside both x and z, they must overlap at least in the area where y is located. And it's possible for x to extend beyond z in some areas, and for z to extend beyond x in other areas. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). Given that y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), and x is inside z, y must also be inside z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). And since y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), and x only touches z's boundary at specific points, y doesn't touch z's boundary, which is also consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary). Given that y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), and x is inside z without touching z's boundary, y must also be inside z without touching z's boundary, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). Given that y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), and z is inside x, y must also be inside x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). But there's a potential issue: if z touches x's boundary, can y still not touch x's boundary (as required by NTPPi(x,y))? Yes, this is still consistent because y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), and z only touches x's boundary at specific points, so y still remains entirely in the interior of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). Given that y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), and z is inside x without touching x's boundary, y must also be inside x without touching x's boundary, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space). If x and z are the same, then saying y is fully inside x and fully inside z is saying the same thing. But here's the issue: NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is a non-tangential proper part of x. And NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x and z are the same (EQ(x,z)), then these are consistent. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Let me double-check my analysis once more, considering the given constraints:

1. NTPPi(x,y): This means y is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z): This means y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For DC(x,z), x and z would be disconnected, which contradicts the fact that they both contain y. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), x and z would only touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points, which contradicts the fact that they both contain y in their interiors. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z), x and z would partially overlap. This is consistent with the given constraints if y is in the overlapping region.

For TPP(x,z), x would be fully inside z and touch z's boundary. This is consistent with the given constraints.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be fully inside z without touching z's boundary. This is consistent with the given constraints.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be fully inside x and touch x's boundary. This is consistent with the given constraints.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be fully inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with the given constraints.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. This is consistent with the given constraints.

Actually, let me think more about this because NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are giving us specific constraints, and I want to make sure I'm correctly accounting for the constraints.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. NTPP(y,z) means y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given these constraints, when can EQ(x,z) hold? If x and z are the same region, then saying y is fully inside x and fully inside z is saying the same thing. But the constraints say NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z), which is consistent if x and z are the same. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

When can TPP(x,z) hold? If x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then y is also fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (due to the buffer between y and x's boundary, and the fact that x only touches z's boundary at specific points). This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

When can NTPP(x,z) hold? If x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and y is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then y is also fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

When can TPPi(x,z) hold? If z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y is also fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (due to the buffer between y and z's boundary). This is consistent with NTPP(y,x). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

When can NTPPi(x,z) hold? If z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y is also fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,x). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

When can PO(x,z) hold? If x and z partially overlap, and y is in the overlapping region, then y is inside both x and z. Additionally, if y doesn't touch the boundary of the overlapping region, then it doesn't touch the boundary of either x or z. So PO(x,z) can be consistent with the given constraints. But I want to make sure we look at this case more carefully...

Actually, if we PO(x,z), can y satisfy NTPP(y,x) (which is the meaning of NTPPi(x,y)) and NTPP(y,z) simultaneously? For NTPP(y,x), y must be fully inside x without touching x's boundary. For NTPP(y,z), y must be fully inside z without touching z's boundary. Can both conditions be met if x and z merely partially overlap?

Yes, if the overlapping region of x and z has an "inner core" that doesn't touch the boundary of the overlapping region, then y can be placed in this inner core. This would ensure that y is fully inside both x and z without touching the boundary of either. So PO(x,z) is possible.

Alright, so the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually wait, let me double-check the PO(x,z) case once more. In PO(x,z), x and z overlap, but neither is fully contained in the other. Given that y is fully inside both x and z without touching either's boundary, y must be in the overlapping region of x and z. But the overlapping region might touch the boundary of either x or z. If it does, then y would need to be sufficiently inside the overlapping region to not touch the boundary.

Actually, let's think of a concrete example. Imagine x and z are two overlapping circles, and y is a smaller circle fully inside the overlapping region. If y is positioned such that it doesn't touch the boundary of the overlapping region, then y is fully inside both x and z without touching either's boundary. So PO(x,z) is possible.

Given the thoroughness of my analysis, I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check the TPPi(x,z) case one more time.

In TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary. Given NTPP(y,z), y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, then y definitely doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,x), which is the meaning of NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given NTPP(y,z), y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, then y definitely doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,x), which is the meaning of NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

I realized I need to be more precise in my understanding of the relations, because I've been going back and forth a bit. Let me clarify once more:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's go through each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. But both x and z contain y, so they must have some overlap. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch only at their boundaries. But both x and z contain y in their interiors, so they must have some overlap in their interiors. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Since y is fully inside both x and z without touching either's boundary, y must be in the overlapping region of x and z. If y is positioned such that it doesn't touch the boundary of the overlapping region, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. In this case, x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), y is also fully inside z without touching z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. In this case, x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), y is also fully inside z without touching z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. In this case, z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is fully inside z without touching z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), y is also fully inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,x), which is the meaning of NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In this case, z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is fully inside z without touching z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), y is also fully inside x without touching x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,x), which is the meaning of NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. In this case, x and z are the same region. If y is fully inside this region without touching its boundary, then both NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(y,z) hold, which is consistent with the given constraints. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Ok, the result is the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z based on the given conditions: NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means the same as NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, since y is inside both x and z, so x and z must share at least the region containing y.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible, since both x and z contain y in their interiors, so they must overlap in their interiors.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y contained in the overlapping region away from the boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be fully inside z and touch z's boundary, while y is inside x away from x's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be fully inside z without touching z's boundary, with y inside x.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be fully inside x and touch x's boundary, with y inside z away from z's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be fully inside x without touching x's boundary, with y inside z.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. If x and z are identical, y can be inside both without touching either's boundary.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
