PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We know that:
- PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is completely contained in the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now let's consider what this implies for the relationship between x and z.

Since PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other. And since NTPP(y,z), we know that y is fully contained in the interior of z.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z have no spatial parts in common. But we know that x and y share some spatial part, and y is completely inside z. So x and z must share at least that part, which means they cannot be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This means x and z touch at their boundaries but have no common interior points. We know that x shares some interior points with y (because of PO(x,y)), and y is completely in the interior of z (because of NTPP(y,z)). So x and z must share some interior points, which contradicts the definition of EC. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This means x and z share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is possible. Since x shares a part with y, and y is completely inside z, x must share that part with z too. But since x is not completely contained in y (because of PO(x,y)), it's possible that x extends beyond y and potentially beyond z as well. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This means x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. x could be partially inside y (because of PO(x,y)) and partially outside y but still inside z, and it could touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This means x is completely contained in the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible. x could be partially inside y (because of PO(x,y)) and partially outside y but still inside the interior of z, not touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: This means z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y is completely contained in z (because of NTPP(y,z)), and x is not completely contained in y (because of PO(x,y)). This means z cannot be completely contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: This means z is completely contained in the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But by the same logic as for TPPi, z cannot be completely contained in x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This means x and z are the same region. This is not possible because y is a proper part of z (due to NTPP(y,z)), and x partially overlaps with y (due to PO(x,y)). So x and z cannot be the same region.

Let me double-check my reasoning.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful. Let's reconsider the case TPPi(x,z). 

TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x. But we know that NTPP(y,z), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. If z is a tangential proper part of x, then y is also fully contained in x (since y is fully contained in z). But this contradicts PO(x,y), which specifies that neither x nor y is fully contained in the other. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), we would have z as a non-tangential proper part of x. But by the same reasoning as for TPPi, this would imply that y is fully contained in x, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

Now, let me re-examine the possibility of EQ(x,z). If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. We know that NTPP(y,z), which means y is properly contained in z. If x and z are the same, then y is also properly contained in x. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which specifies that neither x nor y is fully contained in the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

However, let me think through this a bit more carefully.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share some space, but neither is fully contained in the other. NTPP(y,z) means that y is fully contained in the interior of z, not touching z's boundary.

For the relationship between x and z, let's think about the possible scenarios:

1. If x is mostly outside of y but shares a small part with y, then x will also share that small part with z (since y is fully inside z). In this case, x and z would partially overlap, giving PO(x,z).

2. If x is half inside y and half outside, but still fully inside z, and touching z's boundary, then x would be a tangential proper part of z, giving TPP(x,z).

3. If x is half inside y and half outside, but still fully inside the interior of z (not touching z's boundary), then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z, giving NTPP(x,z).

4. Could x be disconnected from z? No, because x shares a part with y, and y is fully inside z, so x must share that part with z too, meaning they cannot be disconnected.

5. Could x be externally connected to z? No, because x shares interior points with y, and y is fully inside the interior of z, so x must share interior points with z, not just boundary points.

6. Could z be a proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi)? No, because that would imply y is also fully inside x (since y is fully inside z), which contradicts PO(x,y).

7. Could x and z be equal (EQ)? No, because that would imply y is fully inside x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

So I have the same conclusion as before, which is comforting. To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let me analyze what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some space, but neither is contained in the other)
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely contained in the interior of z (not touching z's boundary)

Let me check each possible relation between x and z:

1. Since x shares parts with y (from PO), and y is fully inside z (from NTPP), x must share at least some parts with z. This immediately eliminates DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z) is impossible because x must share interior points with z (via the overlap with y), not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) is possible - x could partially overlap with z by sharing the part that overlaps with y, while extending outside z in other areas.

4. TPP(x,z) is possible - x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) is possible - x could be completely contained in z's interior without touching the boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible because they would require z to be contained in x, which would mean y is contained in x (since y is in z), contradicting PO(x,y).

7. EQ(x,z) is impossible as it would mean x equals z, which would place y completely inside x, contradicting PO(x,y).
