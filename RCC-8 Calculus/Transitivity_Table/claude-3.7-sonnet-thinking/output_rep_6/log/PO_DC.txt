PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step about this problem.

We are given that:
- PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected

We want to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's recall the RCC-8 relations:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (touch at boundary)
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal

Now, given PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some part but neither is fully contained in the other.
Given DC(y,z), we know that y and z are completely disconnected.

Now let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected.
   This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't come into contact with z. Since z is disconnected from y, any part of x that overlaps with y will also be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z could be externally connected.
   This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y touches z at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap.
   This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y is fully contained in z, and some part of x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y is fully contained in z, and no part of x touches the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible if z is fully contained within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible if z is fully contained within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal.
   This is NOT possible because if x and z were equal, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double check these to make sure they are consistent. The key is to consider whether the relation between x and z is consistent with PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let's think about it spatially.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other.
- DC(y,z): y and z are completely separate, no connection at all.

We need to determine if each possible relation between x and z is consistent with these given relations.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is clearly possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is disconnected from z (since y is disconnected from z), and the part of x that doesn't overlap with y can also be separate from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   The part of x that overlaps with y must be disconnected from z. But the part of x that doesn't overlap with y can touch z. So x and z can be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   The part of x that overlaps with y must be disconnected from z. But the part of x that doesn't overlap with y can overlap with z. So x and z can partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x is fully contained in z, then the part of x that overlaps with y would also be contained in z. This would create a connection between y and z (through the overlap), which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I made a mistake. Let me reconsider TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, that means x is fully contained in z and touches the boundary of z. But if x overlaps with y, and y is disconnected from z, then some part of x (the part that overlaps with y) is also disconnected from z. This is a contradiction because if x is fully contained in z, it can't have a part that's disconnected from z.
So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Following similar reasoning as TPP(x,z), if x is fully contained in z, and x overlaps with y, then y and z can't be disconnected. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   If z is fully contained in x, and y overlaps with x, we need to ensure z and y remain disconnected. This is possible if z is contained in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, and z touches the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPPi(x,z), this is possible if z is contained in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are equal, and x overlaps with y, then z would also overlap with y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

After this re-evaluation, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But actually, let me re-think this again. I think my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) might be flawed.

If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), then y and z are completely disconnected. Given PO(x,y), x has some part that overlaps with y, and some part that doesn't.

Let's go through each possible relation between x and z again:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If x and z are completely separate, then it's consistent with the given relations. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   If x touches z only at the boundary, and the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't touch z, then EC(x,z) is consistent. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   If the overlap between x and z doesn't include the part of x that overlaps with y, then PO(x,z) is consistent. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x is fully contained in z, then the part of x that overlaps with y would also be contained in z. This would mean that some part of y (the part that overlaps with x) would be connected to z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to TPP(x,z), if x is fully contained in z, and x overlaps with y, then y and z would be connected through this overlap, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   If z is fully contained in x, it's possible for z to be in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. This way, z remains disconnected from y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPPi(x,z), if z is fully contained in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, then z and y remain disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are equal, and x overlaps with y, then z would also overlap with y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Ok wait. Let me actually draw this out and see if TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are really impossible.

PO(x,y) means x and y have some overlap, but neither is fully contained in the other.
DC(y,z) means y and z are completely disconnected.

Let's draw a case where x is fully contained in z (TPP or NTPP):

```
    z
+-------+
|       |
|   x   |
| +---+ |
| |///| |
| |///| |
| +---+ |
|       |
+-------+
   y
+-----+
|     |
|//////////+  The /// represents the overlap between x and y
|//////////|
|//////////|
+----------+
```

In this drawing, x is fully contained in z, and there's an overlap between x and y. But this drawing is inconsistent because the overlap between x and y would also be contained in z, which means y and z would be connected. But we're given DC(y,z), which means y and z are disconnected.

So, TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are indeed not possible.

Now, let's check TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):

```
    x
+-------+
|       |
|   z   |    y
| +---+ | +-----+
| |   | | |     |
| |   | | |////|  The /// represents the overlap between x and y
| +---+ | |////|
|       | |////|
+-------+ +-----+
```

In this drawing, z is fully contained in x, and there's an overlap between x and y, but z and y are still disconnected. This is consistent with the given relations.

So, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are indeed possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I want to double check one more thing. I want to make sure that the case of EC(x,z) is consistent.

```
    x       z
+-------+-------+
|       |       |
|       |       |
|       |       |
|       |       |
|       |       |
|       |       |
+-------+-------+
   y
+-----+
|     |
|////|     The /// represents the overlap between x and y
|////|
|////|
+-----+
```

In this drawing, x and z are externally connected, and there's an overlap between x and y, but y and z are still disconnected. This is consistent with the given relations.

So, EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

And now I'm sure PO(x,z) is possible, but let me double check anyway:

```
    x       z
+-------+-------+
|       |///////|
|       |///////|
|       |///////|   The /// represents the overlap between x and z
|       |///////|
|       |///////|
|       |       |
+-------+-------+
   y
+-----+
|     |
|\\\\|     The \\\ represents the overlap between x and y
|\\\\|
|\\\\|
+-----+
```

In this drawing, x and z have an overlap, and x and y also have a separate overlap. However, y and z remain disconnected. This is consistent with the given relations.

So, PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

And for completeness, let's check DC(x,z):

```
    x         z
+-------+  +-------+
|       |  |       |
|       |  |       |
|       |  |       |
|       |  |       |
|       |  |       |
|       |  |       |
+-------+  +-------+
   y
+-----+
|     |
|////|     The /// represents the overlap between x and y
|////|
|////|
+-----+
```

In this drawing, x and z are disconnected, and there's an overlap between x and y. This is consistent with the given relations.

So, DC(x,z) is indeed possible.

Based on all of these checks, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let me analyze this systematically:

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some interior parts)
- DC(y,z): y and z are completely disconnected

For each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can be completely disconnected from z
2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can touch z at boundary while still partially overlapping with y
3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially overlap with z in areas that don't overlap with y
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible - if x is contained in z, then the part of x that overlaps with y would create a connection between y and z, contradicting DC(y,z)
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - same reasoning as TPP
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be contained in parts of x that don't overlap with y
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be properly contained in parts of x that don't overlap with y
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x equals z, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also overlap with y, contradicting DC(y,z)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
