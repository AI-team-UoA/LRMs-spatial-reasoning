PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think through this step by step.

Given information:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are equal or coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), they occupy exactly the same space. This means any relationship that x has with y will be exactly the same relationship that x has with z.

Given that NTPP(x,y), which means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, the same relationship must hold between x and z.

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(x,z).

So the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

NTPP(x,y) means x is strictly inside y without touching the boundary.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region.
Therefore, x must be strictly inside z without touching the boundary, which is precisely NTPP(x,z).

So my final answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine how x relates to z given that NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y - x is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space.

Since y and z occupy exactly the same space, and x is completely contained within y without touching its boundary, x must also be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be:

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
