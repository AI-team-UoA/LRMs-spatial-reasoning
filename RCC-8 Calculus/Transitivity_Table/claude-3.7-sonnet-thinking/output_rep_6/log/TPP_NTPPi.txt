PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We have:
1. TPP(x,y) - x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary
2. NTPPi(y,z) - which is the same as NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)

Now I need to determine what relation(s) could hold between x and z.

Since x is part of y and touches y's boundary, and z is completely inside y (not touching the boundary), let's consider the possible arrangements:

1. x and z could be completely separate regions within y, not touching each other. This would be DC(x,z).

2. x and z could touch at their boundaries while both being within y. This would be EC(x,z).

3. x and z could partially overlap, with neither being fully contained in the other. This would be PO(x,z).

4. z could be fully contained in x, touching x's boundary. This would be TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

5. z could be fully contained in x, not touching x's boundary. This would be NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

6. x could be fully contained in z, touching z's boundary. This would be TPP(x,z).

7. x could be fully contained in z, not touching z's boundary. This would be NTPP(x,z).

8. x and z could be coincident (the same region). This would be EQ(x,z).

Now, let's think about which of these are actually possible given our constraints:

- We know z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- We know x is inside y and touches y's boundary

Given these constraints, can x be outside z? Yes, x can be completely separate from z within y.
Can x touch z at the boundary? Yes, that's possible too.
Can x partially overlap with z? Yes.
Can z be inside x? Yes, z could be contained within x.
Can x be inside z? This is tricky. Since x touches y's boundary and z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), it seems impossible for x to be completely inside z, because then x wouldn't touch y's boundary.
Can x and z be the same region? No, because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't.

So the possible relations appear to be:
- DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x

But wait, let me double-check my reasoning about whether x can be inside z.

Actually, I think I made a mistake. Just because z doesn't touch y's boundary doesn't mean that a region inside z can't touch y's boundary. Let me reconsider.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

The second relation actually means that y is completely contained inside z, not touching z's boundary. I misinterpreted this earlier.

So, y is completely inside z, and x is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these correct interpretations, x must be inside z (since x is inside y and y is inside z). Since x touches y's boundary but y doesn't touch z's boundary, x cannot touch z's boundary either. Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z, which is NTPP(x,z).

But I want to be 100% sure, so let me reconsider once more...

Wait, I think I'm still misinterpreting. Let me be very precise:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), so it means NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y; z is properly contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary
- z is properly contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's go through the possibilities again:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x and z share a boundary point while both being within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. This seems possible if z is positioned in a way that part of its boundary is inside y but not touching y's boundary, and x touches this part of z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if z completely contains x and x is positioned so that it doesn't touch any part of z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if x contains z and z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if x completely contains z and z is positioned so that it doesn't touch any part of x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is not possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't.

So, it seems like the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But I'm not satisfied with this analysis, as it doesn't take into account the constraints properly. Let's try a different approach.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is tangentially contained in y
- NTPPi(y,z): z is non-tangentially contained in y

Let me draw this:

```
   z
  +---------------+
  |               |
  |      y        |
  |   +------+    |
  |   |      |    |
  |   |  x   |    |
  |   +------+    |
  |               |
  +---------------+
```

Wait, that's not right. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is inside y, not the other way around.

Let me redraw:

```
       y
  +---------------+
  |               |
  |      z        |
  |   +------+    |
  |   |      |    |
  |   |      |    |
  |   +------+    |
  |      x        |
  +-------+-------+
          |
```

Here, x touches the boundary of y (TPP(x,y)), and z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary (NTPP(z,y)).

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is clearly possible from the diagram.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is also possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible too.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This seems possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is not possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't.

So, all relationships except EQ(x,z) seem possible. But I'm still not confident.

Actually, wait a minute. Let's double-check everything more carefully.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary
- NTPP(z,y): z is properly contained in y and does not touch y's boundary

Given these constraints:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if x and z share a boundary point while both being within y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if z is positioned in a way that includes x, and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is properly contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if z completely contains x and x is positioned so that it doesn't touch any part of z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if x contains z and z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if x completely contains z and z is positioned so that it doesn't touch any part of x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is not possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't.

Let me think about each case and see if there's any constraint I'm missing.

TPP(x,z): For x to be properly contained in z, z must extend at least to the boundary of y where x touches it. But since NTPP(z,y), z cannot touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): If x is properly contained in z without touching z's boundary, and z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary, then x cannot touch y's boundary. But since TPP(x,y), x does touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): For z to be properly contained in x, z must be smaller than x. If z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary, and x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary, then it's possible for z to be properly contained in x and touch x's boundary.

NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi(x,z), it's possible for z to be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary.

So, the possible relationships are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hang on. Let me triple-check my reasoning about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be properly contained in z and touch z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)) and z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(z,y)), then it's not possible for x to be completely inside z, because then x wouldn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be properly contained in z without touching z's boundary. Again, if x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, then x cannot be completely inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let me go over the remaining cases once more:

DC(x,z): This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y.

EC(x,z): This is possible if x and z share a boundary point while both being within y.

PO(x,z): This is possible if x and z share some interior points but neither is fully contained in the other.

TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be properly contained in x and touch x's boundary. Given that z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary (NTPP(z,y)) and x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary (TPP(x,y)), it's possible for z to be properly contained in x and touch x's boundary.

NTPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary. Again, given the constraints, this is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me draw some diagrams to double-check each case.

Case 1: DC(x,z)

```
       y
  +---------------+
  |               |
  |    z          |
  |   +--+        |
  |   |  |        |
  |   +--+        |
  |               |
  |      x        |
  +-------+-------+
          |
```

In this diagram, x and z are disconnected regions within y. x touches y's boundary, and z is completely within y, not touching its boundary. This satisfies our constraints.

Case 2: EC(x,z)

```
       y
  +---------------+
  |               |
  |    z          |
  |   +--+        |
  |   |  |        |
  |   +--+        |
  |    |          |
  |    x          |
  +----+----------+
       |
```

In this diagram, x and z touch at their boundaries. x touches y's boundary, and z is completely within y, not touching its boundary. This satisfies our constraints.

Case 3: PO(x,z)

```
       y
  +---------------+
  |               |
  |    z          |
  |   +--+        |
  |   |  |        |
  |   +--+        |
  |   /|          |
  |  / x          |
  +-/--+----------+
    |  |
```

In this diagram, x and z partially overlap. x touches y's boundary, and z is completely within y, not touching its boundary. This satisfies our constraints.

Case 4: TPPi(x,z)

```
       y
  +---------------+
  |               |
  |      x        |
  |   +------+    |
  |   |      |    |
  |   |  z   |    |
  |   +------+    |
  |               |
  +-------+-------+
          |
```

In this diagram, z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. x touches y's boundary, and z is completely within y, not touching its boundary. This satisfies our constraints.

Case 5: NTPPi(x,z)

```
       y
  +---------------+
  |               |
  |      x        |
  |   +------+    |
  |   |      |    |
  |   |  z   |    |
  |   |  +--+|    |
  |   |  |  ||    |
  |   |  +--+|    |
  |   +------+    |
  |               |
  +-------+-------+
          |
```

In this diagram, z is properly contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. x touches y's boundary, and z is completely within y, not touching its boundary. This satisfies our constraints.

So, after careful analysis and visualization, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Let me be 100% sure. Let me review once more...

Actually, wait. I realized just now that I've been thinking of NTPPi(y,z) as NTPP(z,y), but that's backwards. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(y,z)i, which is NTPP(z,y), which means z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary.

So our constraints are:
- TPP(x,y): x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary
- NTPP(z,y): z is properly contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary

This is consistent with what I've been assuming all along. So my analysis is correct:

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x

ANSWER:

I need to find all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these mean:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)

Now I can analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected regions within y
2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries while both being inside y
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap
4. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x
5. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a non-tangential proper part of x

TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because x touches y's boundary while z doesn't, so x cannot be contained within z.

EQ(x,z) is impossible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they cannot be the same region.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
