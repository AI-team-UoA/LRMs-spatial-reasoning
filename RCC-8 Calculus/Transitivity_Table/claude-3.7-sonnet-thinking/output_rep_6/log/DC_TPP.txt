PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the constraints:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, meaning they share no spatial parts.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and touches the boundary of z.

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given these constraints.

First, let's recall the meaning of all RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no spatial parts)
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (touch at their boundaries but have no common interior)
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some but not all spatial parts)
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(y,x))
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(y,x))
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal (share exactly the same spatial extent)

Now, given that DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), I need to determine which of these relations could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Since x is disconnected from y, and y is a proper part of z, it's possible that x is also disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. Even though x is disconnected from y, it could still touch the boundary of z (since y doesn't cover the entire boundary of z).

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. Even though x is disconnected from y, it could still overlap with parts of z that don't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z): This is not possible. For x to be a tangential proper part of z, it would need to be inside z, which would mean it shares space with z. But given that x is disconnected from y, and y is a part of z, it would mean x doesn't overlap with at least part of z. So, it can't be entirely inside z.

Wait, I think I'm mistaken in my reasoning. Let me reconsider point 4:

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. Just because x is disconnected from y doesn't mean it can't be inside z. For instance, x and y could be two separate regions inside z, both touching the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. Similar to TPP, x and y could be two separate regions inside z, with x not touching the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. It means z is a tangential proper part of x. In this case, z would be inside x and touch the boundary of x. This is compatible with y being a proper part of z (and thus also a proper part of x), as long as x and y don't overlap.

Actually, let me check this again. For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be a proper part of x. But if z is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of z, then y is a proper part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): By the same logic as TPPi, this is not possible. If z is inside x, and y is inside z, then y is inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y is a part of z, then y is a part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, I think I've been making a logical error. Let me think more carefully.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y don't share any spatial parts.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's think about what each relation would mean for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z don't share any spatial parts. This is certainly possible. x could be completely outside of z.

2. EC(x,z): x touches the boundary of z but doesn't share any interior. This is possible too. x could be outside of z but touching z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some but not all of their interior. This is possible. x could overlap with a part of z that doesn't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. For this to be true, x would have to be inside z. Given that y is also inside z, and x and y are disconnected, this means x and y are two separate regions inside z, both touching z's boundary. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, this is possible if x and y are two separate regions inside z, with x not touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. If y is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of x, then y is a proper part of x. But this contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, this would imply y is a proper part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of z, then y is a proper part of x. But this contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me check my reasoning more carefully:

For TPPi(x,z), I said that if y is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of x, then y is a proper part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). But I think there's a subtlety here. DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, which means they don't share any spatial parts. If y is a proper part of x, then they would share spatial parts, which would indeed contradict DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is definitely not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), the same logic applies. If z is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of z, then y is a proper part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same, and y is a proper part of z, then y is a proper part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's double check the other relations:

For DC(x,z), x and z don't share any spatial parts. If y is a proper part of z, and x and y are disconnected, then it's possible for x to be completely outside of z. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

For EC(x,z), x touches the boundary of z but doesn't share any interior. If y is a proper part of z, and x and y are disconnected, then it's possible for x to be outside of z but touching z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z), x and z share some but not all of their interior. If y is a proper part of z, and x and y are disconnected, then it's possible for x to overlap with a part of z that doesn't include y. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. For this to be true, x would have to be inside z. Given that y is also inside z, and x and y are disconnected, this means x and y are two separate regions inside z, both touching z's boundary. This is possible. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, this is possible if x and y are two separate regions inside z, with x not touching z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me think about this even more carefully. Given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we know:
1. x and y are disconnected.
2. y is a tangential proper part of z.

Let's visualize this:
- y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- x is completely separate from y.

Now, where can x be in relation to z?

1. x can be completely outside of z, which would make DC(x,z).
2. x can be touching the boundary of z from the outside, which would make EC(x,z).
3. x can be overlapping with z (but not with y), which would make PO(x,z).
4. x can be fully inside z (but not overlapping with y), touching z's boundary, which would make TPP(x,z).
5. x can be fully inside z (but not overlapping with y), not touching z's boundary, which would make NTPP(x,z).

But x cannot be in a relationship where z is inside x, because y is inside z, and if z is inside x, then y would be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I think I've been consistent in my reasoning throughout, and the answer is:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (no shared parts)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

I need to determine all possible relations between x and z.

Let's analyze each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x could be completely outside of z while y is inside z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x could touch z's boundary from the outside while y is inside z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x could partially overlap with z in regions where y isn't present.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be inside z touching z's boundary, but in a region separate from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z, not touching its boundary, and still separate from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were inside x, then y would also be inside x (since y is inside z), contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Similar to TPPi, this would require y to be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, then y would be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
