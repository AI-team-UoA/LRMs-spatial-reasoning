PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm analyzing the given information:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts

Since x and y are exactly the same spatial region (EQ), x has exactly the same relationship with z as y does with z. 

Given that y and z are externally connected (EC), it means:
- x and z must also be externally connected

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is:
EC(x,z)

Let me double check my reasoning:
- If x and y are coincident, then x's boundary = y's boundary and x's interior = y's interior
- If y and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts, then x and z must do the same
- No other RCC-8 relation is possible between x and z given these constraints

So the answer is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region), x must have the same spatial relationship with z that y has with z.

Given that EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts, the only possible relationship between x and z is also EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)
