PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We have:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. So x is inside y, and touches y's boundary at some point.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is inside z, and touches z's boundary at some point.

Now we need to determine what can be the relationship between x and z.

First, since x is inside y, and y is inside z, we know that x must be inside z as well. So x has to be a proper part of z, either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

Let's consider whether x can touch the boundary of z or not:

If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x would also touch the boundary of z. In this case, TPP(x,z) would hold.

If x only touches the boundary of y at points where y doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x would not touch the boundary of z. In this case, NTPP(x,z) would hold.

So the possible relationships are:
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Let me double-check by visualizing examples:

Example 1: Imagine z as a big circle, y as a medium circle inside z that touches z's boundary, and x as a small circle inside y that touches y's boundary exactly where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x also touches z's boundary, so TPP(x,z) holds.

Example 2: Imagine z as a big circle, y as a medium circle inside z that touches z's boundary, and x as a small circle inside y that touches y's boundary but at a different point than where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x does not touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) holds.

Both scenarios are possible, so the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships can hold between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x must be inside z. So x must be a proper part of z.

There are two possibilities:
1. If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x would also touch z's boundary, making TPP(x,z).
2. If x only touches the boundary of y at points where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x would not touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)
