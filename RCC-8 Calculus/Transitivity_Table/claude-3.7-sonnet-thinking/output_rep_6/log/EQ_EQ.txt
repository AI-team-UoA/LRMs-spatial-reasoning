PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We have two premises:
- EQ(x, y): x and y are coincident (they occupy the same space)
- EQ(y, z): y and z are coincident

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about what EQ means. If x and y are coincident, they occupy exactly the same spatial region. And if y and z are coincident, they also occupy exactly the same spatial region.

So if x occupies the same region as y, and y occupies the same region as z, then x must occupy the same region as z. This is simply the transitive property applied to spatial equivalence.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x, z).

Let me double check. If EQ(x, y) and EQ(y, z), then x and z must be coincident, which means EQ(x, z).

No other relation is possible because:
- DC requires x and z to be disconnected, but they occupy the same region
- EC requires x and z to only touch at boundaries, but they share their entire regions
- PO requires partial overlap, but they have complete overlap
- TPP requires x to be a proper part of z with boundary contact, but they are equivalent
- NTPP requires x to be a proper part of z without boundary contact, but they are equivalent
- TPPi requires z to be a proper part of x with boundary contact, but they are equivalent
- NTPPi requires z to be a proper part of x without boundary contact, but they are equivalent

The only possible answer is EQ(x, z).

ANSWER:

If we have EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region).
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident.

Since x and y occupy the same region, and y and z occupy the same region, by transitivity, x and z must also occupy the same region.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
