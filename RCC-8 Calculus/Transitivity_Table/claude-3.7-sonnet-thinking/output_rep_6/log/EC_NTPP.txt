PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We know that:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

We need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's analyze what we know:
- x touches y at a boundary, but they don't share interior parts.
- y is properly inside z (not touching z's boundary).

So what are the possible relations between x and z?

Given that y is properly inside z (NTPP), and x touches y at a boundary (EC), there are several possibilities:
1. x could be disconnected from z (DC).
2. x could touch z at a boundary (EC).
3. x could partially overlap with z (PO).
4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP).
5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).
6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi).
7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi).
8. x and z could be equal (EQ).

Let's eliminate some of these options:

- EQ(x,z) is not possible because if x and z were equal, then y would be NTPP of x, which contradicts EC(x,y).

- NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of x) is not possible. If z were completely inside x, then y would also be completely inside x (since y is inside z). But this contradicts EC(x,y).

- TPPi(x,z) (i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x) is not possible. If z were inside x and touching the boundary of x, then y would be inside z, which is inside x. But this means y is inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y).

Let's continue analyzing the remaining possibilities:

- DC(x,z): Is it possible for x to be disconnected from z? If y is properly inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x only touches y at a boundary, then it's possible for x to be disconnected from z. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle completely inside z, and x as a circle that just touches y but doesn't enter z.

- EC(x,z): Is it possible for x to touch z at a boundary? If y is properly inside z, and x touches y, then x could also touch z at a boundary if x extends to the boundary of z. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z but not touching z's boundary, and x as a shape that touches y and extends to touch z's boundary.

- PO(x,z): Is it possible for x to partially overlap with z? If y is properly inside z, and x touches y at a boundary, then x could partially overlap with z if part of x is inside z and part is outside. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, and x as a shape that touches y and has parts both inside and outside of z.

- TPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z? If y is properly inside z, and x touches y, then x could be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, and x as a shape entirely inside z that touches y and also touches z's boundary.

- NTPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z? If y is properly inside z, and x touches y, then x could be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, and x as a shape entirely inside z that touches y but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's double-check each of these:

DC(x,z): This requires x to be entirely outside z. But we know that x touches y, and y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. It seems unlikely that x could touch y without entering z. I need to reconsider this.

Actually, DC(x,z) is not possible. Since y is NTPP of z, y is completely inside z without touching the boundary of z. If x is EC with y, then x touches y at the boundary. But since y is strictly inside z, any point that touches y must be inside or on the boundary of z. So x cannot be disconnected from z.

EC(x,z): This means x touches z at a boundary but doesn't share interior parts with z. Given that y is inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y, it's possible for x to extend outward from y and just touch z's boundary without entering z. So EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other. Given that y is inside z, and x touches y, it's possible for part of x to be inside z (the part that touches y) and part of x to be outside z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z and also touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given that y is inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Let me just think a bit more about the NTPP(x,z) relation, as I'm not 100% sure it is possible. 

We know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be fully inside z and not touch z's boundary. 

Hmm, I'm thinking in terms of 2D shapes like circles to visualize this. If y is a circle fully inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a circle that touches y at a boundary, then x would need to be fully inside z and not touch z's boundary. This seems geometrically possible. I could have z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, and x as a circle inside z that touches y but doesn't touch z's boundary.

So I think NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Alright, let's finalize the possible relations between x and z:

- EC(x,z): x touches z at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me double-check once more if any of these are incorrect or if I missed anything.

For EC(x,z), we need to ensure that x touches z's boundary and doesn't share interior parts with z. Given that y is NTPP of z, y is away from z's boundary. If x is EC with y, then x touches y's boundary. It's possible for x to extend outward from y and just touch z's boundary without entering the interior of z, making EC(x,z) possible.

For PO(x,z), we need x and z to share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other. If y is NTPP of z, and x is EC with y, then x touches y's boundary. It's possible for part of x to be inside z (the part that touches y) and part of x to be outside z, making PO(x,z) possible.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. If y is NTPP of z, and x is EC with y, then it's possible for x to be entirely inside z and also touch z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) possible.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. If y is NTPP of z, and x is EC with y, then it's possible for x to be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) possible.

Ah, I just realized that I should check one more case: DC(x,z).

For DC(x,z), we need x and z to be disconnected. If y is NTPP of z, then y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. If x is EC with y, then x touches y's boundary. But since y is entirely inside z, any point that touches y must be inside or on the boundary of z. This means x cannot be disconnected from z, so DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. I'm a bit confused about my own logic. 

If y is NTPP of z, it means y is fully contained within z, without touching z's boundary. 

If x is EC with y, it means x touches y at a boundary but doesn't share any interior parts.

Could x be DC with z? If x is outside of z, and y is inside z, then x and y would need to cross z's boundary to touch each other. But since EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary, which means x is in contact with y. Since y is strictly inside z, the only way for x to touch y is if x is also inside z or at least touches z. This means x cannot be completely disconnected from z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Could x be EC with z? If x touches z's boundary and doesn't enter the interior of z, and y is strictly inside z, then x and y would not be in contact. But we know EC(x,y), so this creates a contradiction. Actually, no, I don't think that's right. Let's visualize this: z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z, and x is a shape that touches y and extends to touch z's boundary. It's possible for x to be partly inside z (the part that touches y) and partly outside z, with the boundary of x crossing the boundary of z. This would make EC(x,z) impossible because x would have to share interior parts with z. But if x is entirely inside z and touches both y and z's boundary, then x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP).

Hmm, let me reconsider EC(x,z) more carefully.

EC(x,z) means x touches z at a boundary but doesn't share any interior parts with z. If y is NTPP of z, then y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. If x is EC with y, then x touches y at a boundary. For x to not share any interior parts with z, x would need to be entirely outside z and just touch z's boundary. But this would mean x cannot touch y, which contradicts EC(x,y). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Alright, I think I've been making an error in my reasoning. Let me start over:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x would need to touch z at a boundary but not share any interior parts with z. However, since y is entirely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y at a boundary, x must have at least some part inside z (the part that touches y). This means x and z share interior parts, making EC(x,z) impossible.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other. Since y is entirely inside z, and x touches y at a boundary, part of x must be inside z. If part of x is also outside z, then PO(x,z) would be true.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y at a boundary and also extends to touch z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is small enough to touch y at a boundary but not reach z's boundary.

Now, am I missing any possible relations? The other RCC-8 relations are DC, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

We already established that DC(x,z) is not possible because x must have some part inside z to touch y.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. However, since y is entirely inside z, and x only touches y at a boundary, z cannot be entirely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be coincident. However, since y is entirely inside z, and x only touches y at a boundary, x and z cannot be coincident. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I think I have the correct set of possible relations now:

- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's double-check once more.

For PO(x,z), we need x and z to share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other. Since y is entirely inside z, and x touches y at a boundary, part of x must be inside z. If part of x is also outside z, then PO(x,z) would be true. This seems possible.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at a boundary, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z and also touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given that y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y at a boundary, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For DC(x,z), we need x and z to be disconnected. But since y is entirely inside z, and x touches y, x must have some part inside or on the boundary of z, making DC(x,z) impossible.

For EC(x,z), we need x to touch z at a boundary but not share any interior parts with z. But since y is entirely inside z, and x touches y, x must have some part inside z, making EC(x,z) impossible.

Wait, I think I'm not being careful enough in my reasoning here.

Actually, let's think about EC(x,z) again. We know that y is NTPP of z, so y is away from z's boundary. We know that x is EC with y, so x touches y at a boundary. Now, for x to be EC with z, x would need to touch z at a boundary but not share any interior parts with z. Is this possible? If x touches y at a boundary, and y is inside z, then the point where x touches y is inside z. So x has a point inside z, which means x and z share an interior part, making EC(x,z) impossible.

Ok, I think I've been having trouble understanding the precise definitions of the RCC-8 relations. Let me just carefully reason through all 8 relations to see which ones are possible for the relation between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected and share no parts. Since y is NTPP of z, y is entirely inside z. Since x is EC with y, x touches y. But since y is inside z, x must have at least a point inside or on the boundary of z to touch y. This means x and z are not disconnected, making DC(x,z) impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Since y is NTPP of z, y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. Since x is EC with y, x touches y at a boundary. For x to be EC with z, x would need to touch z at a boundary without having any part inside z. But since x touches y, and y is entirely inside z, x must have at least a point inside z. This means x and z must share some interior parts, making EC(x,z) impossible.

Actually, I'm making a mistake in my reasoning for EC. Let me be precise about the definition. EC(x,z) means that the interior of x and the interior of z don't overlap, but the boundaries touch. It's not that x doesn't have any part inside z, but rather that the interior of x doesn't overlap with the interior of z. 

Actually no, that's not right either. EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means the interior of x does not overlap with the interior of z, but their boundaries touch.

Now, if y is NTPP of z, then y is entirely inside z, with the boundary of y strictly inside the interior of z. If x is EC with y, then x touches the boundary of y. Since the boundary of y is within the interior of z, the point where x touches y is within the interior of z. This means the boundary of x has a point in the interior of z. For EC(x,z) to be true, the boundary of x would need to touch the boundary of z, and the interior of x would need to not overlap with the interior of z. But since the boundary of x has a point in the interior of z, the interior of x must also have a point in the interior of z (since the interior of a region includes points arbitrarily close to its boundary). This means the interior of x overlaps with the interior of z, making EC(x,z) impossible.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this and maybe making a mistake in my understanding. Let me visualize this with shapes. 

Imagine z as a large circle. Since y is NTPP of z, y is a smaller circle entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary. Now, since x is EC with y, x touches the boundary of y but doesn't overlap with the interior of y. For example, x could be a third circle that touches y at a point.

Now, can x be EC with z? For this to be true, x would need to touch the boundary of z without having its interior overlap with the interior of z. But since x touches y, and y is entirely inside z, x must have a point inside the interior of z. This means the interior of x must overlap with the interior of z, making EC(x,z) impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other. Since y is NTPP of z, and x is EC with y, we know that x touches y at a boundary. This means x has a point inside the interior of z. If x also has parts outside z, then PO(x,z) would be true. This seems possible. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, and x as a shape that touches y and extends outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is NTPP of z, and x is EC with y, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z and also touch z's boundary. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, and x as a shape entirely inside z that touches both y and the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given that y is NTPP of z, and x is EC with y, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z, and x as a shape entirely inside z that touches y but doesn't reach the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. But since y is entirely inside z, and x only touches y at a boundary, z cannot be entirely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. However, since y is entirely inside z, and x only touches y at a boundary, x and z cannot be coincident. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this detailed analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So my final answer: The possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let me double-check my reasoning with some concrete examples to see if I missed anything.

Example 1: z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a circle that touches y at a point and extends outside z. In this case, x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z) is true.

Example 2: z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z, and x is a circle entirely inside z that touches both y and the boundary of z. In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z, so TPP(x,z) is true.

Example 3: z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z, and x is a circle entirely inside z that touches y but doesn't reach the boundary of z. In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z) is true.

Can I think of an example where any other RCC-8 relation holds? Let's see...

For DC(x,z): If z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z, and x is a circle outside z, then x and y would not touch, contradicting EC(x,y). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z): If z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z, and x is a circle that touches the boundary of z from the outside, then x and y would not touch, contradicting EC(x,y). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z, and x is a larger circle containing z, then x and y would not touch at a boundary (x would contain part of y), contradicting EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if x completely contains z, then x would also contain y, contradicting EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same circle, and y is a smaller circle inside them, then x would contain y, contradicting EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I'm pretty confident now that the only possible relations between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Wait, I realized there's an issue with my visualization of the EC relation. EC means that two regions touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means the regions meet but do not overlap.

Let me re-check my examples for PO, TPP, and NTPP.

For PO(x,z): I said z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z, and x is a circle that touches y at a point and extends outside z. But if x is a circle that touches y at a point, then x and y overlap in their interiors, which contradicts EC(x,y). So this example doesn't work for EC(x,y). 

Actually, the issue is that I was thinking of circles, which don't satisfy the EC relation when they just touch at a point. I need to think of shapes with boundaries that can touch.

Let me think of x and y as two non-circular shapes that touch at a boundary. For example, imagine y as a square inside z, and x as a shape that touches the boundary of y without overlapping with the interior of y. Now, can x and z have the PO relation? Yes, if part of x is inside z and part is outside. Can x and z have the TPP relation? Yes, if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. Can x and z have the NTPP relation? Yes, if x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.

I'm still confident that the possible relations between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me reconsider DC(x,z). I said it's not possible because x must have at least a point inside or on the boundary of z to touch y. But what if x and y touch at the boundary of z? Then x would be outside z, y would be inside z, and they would touch at a point on the boundary of z. But wait, this contradicts NTPP(y,z), which says y does not touch z's boundary. So DC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let me reconsider EC(x,z). I said it's not possible because the point where x touches y is inside z, meaning x has a point inside z. But what if x touches y at a point, and then extends outward to just touch the boundary of z? In this case, x would touch z at a boundary without having its interior overlap with the interior of z. But wait, this still doesn't work. If y is NTPP of z, then y is away from z's boundary. If x touches y, then x has a point inside z. For EC(x,z) to be true, x would need to touch z's boundary without having its interior overlap with the interior of z. But since x has a point inside z, its interior must overlap with the interior of z, making EC(x,z) impossible.

Actully, I think I'm getting confused because I'm implicitly assuming that x and y are simple shapes like circles. This constrains my thinking, e.g. because two circles can only be EC if they touch at a single point. But the RCC-8 relations apply to any pair of regions, so I should consider the general definitions.

So let's get back to basics. Given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), what are the possible relations between x and z?

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. NTPP(y,z) means that y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. This means y is strictly inside z.

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is strictly inside z, and x touches y, x must have at least a point inside or on the boundary of z. This means x and z are not disconnected, making DC(x,z) impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. But since y is strictly inside z, and x touches y, x must have at least a point inside z. This means x and z must share some interior parts, making EC(x,z) impossible.

Actually I'm still having trouble with the EC case. Let me think about this differently. 

If x and y are EC, they touch at a boundary but don't overlap interiors. Since y is NTPP of z, y's entire boundary is within the interior of z. So the point where x touches y is within the interior of z. This means x has a point inside the interior of z. 

For EC(x,z) to be true, x would need to touch the boundary of z without having its interior overlap with the interior of z. But since x has a point inside the interior of z, x's interior must overlap with z's interior, making EC(x,z) impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other. Since y is strictly inside z, and x touches y, x must have a point inside z. If x also has parts outside z, then PO(x,z) would be true. This seems possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is strictly inside z, and x touches y, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z and also touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given that y is strictly inside z, and x touches y, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. But since y is entirely inside z, and x only touches y at a boundary, z cannot be entirely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. However, since y is entirely inside z, and x only touches y at a boundary, x and z cannot be coincident. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

I'm fairly confident that this is the correct answer. 

Let me do one final double-check by visualizing these relations.

For PO(x,z): Imagine z as a large square. Since y is NTPP of z, y is a smaller square inside z, not touching z's boundary. Since x is EC with y, x touches the boundary of y without overlapping with the interior of y. For example, x could be a shape that touches y at a point or along a segment of y's boundary. If part of x is inside z and part is outside, then PO(x,z) would be true. This is possible if x is a large enough shape that touches y and extends outside z.

For TPP(x,z): Using the same setup, if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) would be true. This is possible if x is a shape that touches y and extends to touch z's boundary, but doesn't go outside z.

For NTPP(x,z): Again with the same setup, if x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) would be true. This is possible if x is a small shape that touches y but doesn't reach z's boundary.

I think this confirms that PO, TPP, and NTPP are the only possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let me analyze what these given relations tell us:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts
- NTPP(y,z): y is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

First, I'll eliminate impossible relations:

1. DC(x,z) is impossible: Since y is strictly inside z, and x touches y, x must have at least a point inside z, so they can't be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) is impossible: Since y is strictly inside z, the point where x touches y must be in the interior of z, meaning x and z share interior points.

3. TPPi(x,z) is impossible: This would require z to be inside x, but since y is inside z and x only touches y at a boundary, z cannot be inside x.

4. NTPPi(x,z) is impossible: Similar reason as TPPi.

5. EQ(x,z) is impossible: Since y is strictly inside z and x only touches y at a boundary, x and z cannot be equal.

The possible relations are:

1. PO(x,z): x can partially overlap z if it touches y (which is inside z) and also extends outside z.

2. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z if it's entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
