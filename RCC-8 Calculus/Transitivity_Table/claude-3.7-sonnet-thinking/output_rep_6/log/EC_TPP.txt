PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this scenario carefully. We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary

I need to determine what relationship(s) could hold between x and z.

Let's think about the possible relations one by one:

1. **DC(x,z)** - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   If y touches x (EC(x,y)) and y is inside z but touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), then it's possible that x is entirely outside of z, with no contact. This would occur if the part of y's boundary that touches x is different from the part that touches z's boundary. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. **EC(x,z)** - Is it possible that x and z are externally connected?
   If the part of y that touches x also coincides with where y touches z's boundary, then x would touch z at the boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. **PO(x,z)** - Is it possible that x partially overlaps z?
   If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, then it's possible that part of x extends inside z while another part remains outside. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. **TPP(x,z)** - Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   If x touches y at the boundary, and if that boundary of y is entirely inside z except where y touches z's boundary, then x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. **NTPP(x,z)** - Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   If x touches y at a boundary that is completely inside z (not where y touches z's boundary), then x would be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. **TPPi(x,z)** - Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. But we know y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is inside z. And we know x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)). It seems implausible that z could be contained in x while y is contained in z, yet x only touches y at the boundary. So TPPi(x,z) seems impossible.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)** - Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   Similar to the reasoning for TPPi, this seems impossible given the constraints.

8. **EQ(x,z)** - Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   If x and z were equal, then since y is a proper part of z, y would be a proper part of x. But we know EC(x,y), which means x and y only touch at their boundaries. These are contradictory, so EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Let me double-check my reasoning by visualizing some examples:

For DC(x,z):
Imagine y as a small circle touching the boundary of a larger circle z. Now imagine x as another small circle touching y at a point different from where y touches z. In this case, x and z don't touch at all.

For EC(x,z):
Imagine y as a small circle touching the boundary of a larger circle z. Now imagine x as another small circle touching y exactly at the point where y touches z. In this case, x and z touch at a single point.

For PO(x,z):
Imagine y as a small circle touching the boundary of a larger circle z. Now imagine x as a circle that overlaps with both y and z, touching y at their shared boundary and extending partly inside and partly outside of z.

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine y as a small circle touching the boundary of a larger circle z. Now imagine x as a circle completely inside z but touching z's boundary, and also touching y's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z):
Imagine y as a small circle touching the boundary of a larger circle z. Now imagine x as a circle completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, but touching y's boundary.

After visualizing, I think my previous analysis is correct. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Wait, let me reconsider TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) more carefully:

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z while touching z's boundary. But we also need EC(x,y), meaning x touches y only at their boundary. This seems geometrically possible - if x touches y at a point on y's boundary that also happens to be on z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But we also need EC(x,y), which means x touches y at their boundary. Given that y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), it's not immediately clear if x can touch y at a point that's not on z's boundary while still being completely inside z.

Let me think more carefully about NTPP(x,z):

If y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then y touches z's boundary at some points but not all of y's boundary points need to touch z's boundary. Some parts of y's boundary can be strictly inside z.

Now, if x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), then x touches y's boundary. If x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is strictly inside z, and x is also strictly inside z, then NTPP(x,z) would hold.

So, I think NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible. Let's update the list of possible relationships:

- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Wait, let me think about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) more carefully. 

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z while touching z's boundary. But we also need EC(x,y), meaning x touches y only at their boundary. If x is completely inside z, and y is also inside z (with y touching z's boundary), and x only touches y at their boundary, then it's possible that x also touches z's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary, or at a different point.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is strictly inside z, then NTPP(x,z) would hold.

After careful consideration, I believe both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible.

Let me now finalize the list of possible relationships between x and z:

- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I don't think TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z) are possible given the constraints.

Actually, wait. Let me very carefully consider the case of TPPi(x,z) again. 

If TPPi(x,z) holds, then z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we also know that y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), so y is inside z and touches z's boundary. This would place y inside x as well. But we're given that EC(x,y), which means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This contradicts y being inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z would be a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Again, this would place y inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is also impossible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But if y is a tangential proper part of z (and hence of x), then y is inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, after careful reconsideration, the possible relationships between x and z are:

- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This confirms my earlier analysis. These five relations are the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Actually, let's double-check my understanding:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary (inverse of TPP).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary (inverse of NTPP).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Now let's check each relation more carefully:

1. **DC(x,z)** - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries.
   TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
   If x touches y at a point different from where y touches z, then x and z might not touch at all. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. **EC(x,z)** - Is it possible that x and z are externally connected?
   If x touches y at the exact point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary without overlapping with z. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. **PO(x,z)** - Is it possible that x partially overlaps z?
   For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z need to share some interior points, but neither should be fully contained in the other. Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), is it possible for x to partially extend into z? If x touches y at the boundary and extends into z, it would share interior points with z. This seems geometrically possible. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. **TPP(x,z)** - Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   For TPP(x,z) to hold, x needs to be fully inside z and touch z's boundary. If x is a small region that touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and is located entirely inside z such that it also touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) would hold. This seems geometrically possible. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. **NTPP(x,z)** - Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x needs to be fully inside z without touching z's boundary. If x is a small region that touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and is located entirely inside z such that it doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) would hold. This seems geometrically possible. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. **TPPi(x,z)** - Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z needs to be fully inside x and touch x's boundary. But we know TPP(y,z), which means y is inside z. If z is inside x, then y would also be inside x. But we're given EC(x,y), which means x and y only touch at their boundaries and don't overlap. This contradicts y being inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)** - Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   Similar to the reasoning for TPPi, this would place y inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. **EQ(x,z)** - Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   If x and z are the same region, then since TPP(y,z), y is inside x. But this contradicts EC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

After this careful re-analysis, I confirm my previous conclusion:

The possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, let me revisit PO(x,z) again. 

For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z need to share some interior points, but neither should be fully contained in the other. 

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. 

Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So, x touches y at their boundaries, and y is inside z. How can x share interior points with z?

If x extends into z beyond the boundary of y, then x would overlap with z. But if x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't extend into z, then x wouldn't share interior points with z.

Upon re-reflection, I don't think PO(x,z) is possible. If x only touches y at their boundaries (EC(x,y)), and y is inside z (TPP(y,z)), then x can either be entirely outside z (DC(x,z)), touch z's boundary without overlapping (EC(x,z)), or be inside z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)).

Actually wait, I need to be more careful. The scenario isn't as straightforward as I initially thought.

Let's try to visualize the scenario:

- TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now, let's think about where x can be in relation to z:

1. If x is entirely outside z, then DC(x,z) holds.
2. If x touches z's boundary without overlapping, then EC(x,z) holds.
3. If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) holds.
4. If x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds.
5. Now, for PO(x,z), we need x to share some interior points with z, but neither should be fully contained in the other.

Let's consider a specific scenario: y is a small circle that touches the boundary of a larger circle z. Now, consider x to be a circle that touches y at their boundaries (EC(x,y)). If x is positioned such that it partially extends inside z and partially outside, then PO(x,z) would hold.

Given the constraints EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), it's plausible for x to partially overlap with z. So, PO(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

After reconsideration, I maintain my earlier conclusion:

The possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of EC(x,y) again: "EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts."

This means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Now, let's visualize:

If y is a circle that touches the boundary of a larger circle z (TPP(y,z)), and x is a circle that touches the boundary of y (EC(x,y)), then x can be:

1. Entirely outside z, which gives DC(x,z).
2. Touching z's boundary without overlapping, which gives EC(x,z).
3. Partially inside and partially outside z, which gives PO(x,z).
4. Entirely inside z and touching z's boundary, which gives TPP(x,z).
5. Entirely inside z and not touching z's boundary, which gives NTPP(x,z).

These are the only plausible configurations given the constraints. So, the possible relationships are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Ok, let's make sure of PO(x,z) using a specific example. Consider the 2D plane with the following:

- z is the region enclosed by the square with corners at (0,0), (10,0), (10,10), and (0,10).
- y is the region enclosed by the circle with center (5,10) and radius 2. Note that this circle touches the top edge of the square z, so TPP(y,z) holds.
- x is the region enclosed by the circle with center (5,13) and radius 1. This circle touches the circle y at the point (5,12), so EC(x,y) holds.

Now, in this scenario, the circle x extends partially inside the square z (specifically, the region of x below the line y=10). So, x and z share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other. This gives PO(x,z).

Given this concrete example, I'm confident that PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I think this is the correct answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at a point of y's boundary that is not where y touches z's boundary, then x and z can be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x touches y exactly at the point where y touches z's boundary, then x would touch z's boundary without overlapping with z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at their boundaries and extends partially into z and partially outside z, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. If x is completely inside z while touching z's boundary (and also touching y's boundary), then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (but touching y at a boundary point of y that is inside z), then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible. This would require z to be inside x, but since y is inside z (TPP(y,z)) and x only touches y at their boundary (EC(x,y)), y cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. Similar reasoning to TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x and z were equal, then y would be inside x (since TPP(y,z)), contradicting EC(x,y).
