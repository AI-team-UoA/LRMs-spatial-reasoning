PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step-by-step. 

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, which means they share some spatial part, but neither is contained in the other.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, which means they occupy exactly the same space.

Given that y and z occupy exactly the same space (EQ(y,z)), anything that relates to y in a certain way must relate to z in the same way.

Since PO(x,y), which means x partially overlaps with y, and given that y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), x must also partially overlap with z in the exact same way.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).

To double-check, let me reason through the definition of PO(x,y):
1. x and y share some spatial part.
2. x is not a part of y.
3. y is not a part of x.

Now, since EQ(y,z), z has exactly the same spatial extent as y. So:
1. x and z share some spatial part (the same parts that x and y share).
2. x is not a part of z (because x is not a part of y, and y and z are identical in spatial extent).
3. z is not a part of x (because y is not a part of x, and y and z are identical in spatial extent).

Thus, the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).

I'm now convinced that the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relation holds between x and z given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some part, but neither is part of the other)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (occupy exactly the same space)

Since y and z occupy exactly the same space (they are equal), anything that relates to y in a specific way must relate to z in exactly the same way.

Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y is identical to z, then x must also partially overlap with z in precisely the same manner.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
