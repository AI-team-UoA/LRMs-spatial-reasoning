PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this carefully.

We know that PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. In other words, x and y partially overlap.

NTPPi(y,z) means the same as NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. So z is a proper non-tangential part of y.

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's visualize this: 
- x partially overlaps with y, so some part of x is inside y and some part is outside y.
- z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given this, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't intersect with z.
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y touches z at its boundary.
3. PO(x,z) - Partial overlap: This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y also partially overlaps with z.
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This is not possible. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would be inside z and touch z's boundary. But since z is inside y without touching y's boundary, and part of x is outside y, x cannot be completely inside z.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This is not possible for the same reason as TPP.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: This is possible if z is a tangential proper part of x. The part of x that overlaps with y could contain all of z, and z could touch the boundary of this overlap.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: This is possible if z is a non-tangential proper part of x. The part of x that overlaps with y could contain all of z, and z might not touch the boundary of this overlap.
8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This is not possible. If x and z were equal, then x would be completely inside y without touching y's boundary. But we know that x partially overlaps with y, so some part of x is outside y.

Wait, I'm confused about the possibilities 4, 5, 6, and 7. Let me reconsider:

For TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), I said these are not possible because part of x is outside y, but z is inside y. But this logic is incorrect. I was thinking of x being inside z, not the other way around. Let me reconsider:

For TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, for x to be inside z, x must also be inside y. But PO(x,y) means part of x is outside y. So, x cannot be completely inside z, making TPP(x,z) impossible.

For NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, for x to be inside z, x must also be inside y. But since part of x is outside y, x cannot be completely inside z, making NTPP(x,z) impossible.

For TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, touching the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, it's possible for z to be completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, without touching x's boundary.

Hmm, hold on. I need to be careful here. Let's reason through this once more with a clear understanding of the spatial relationships.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. So, some part of x is inside y, and some part of x is outside y.

NTPPi(y,z) means that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Wait, I think I got the interpretation of NTPPi(y,z) wrong. NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. But NTPPi(y,z) actually means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So, z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Okay, with that clarification, let's proceed:

PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given these, let's reason about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't intersect with z. So, x and z are entirely separate.
2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y touches z at its boundary.
3. PO(x,z) - Partial overlap: This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y also partially overlaps with z.
4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This is not possible. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would be inside z and touch z's boundary. But since z is inside y without touching y's boundary, and part of x is outside y, x cannot be completely inside z.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This is not possible for the same reason as TPP.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: This is possible if z is a tangential proper part of x. The part of x that overlaps with y could contain all of z, and z could touch the boundary of this overlap.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: This is possible if z is a non-tangential proper part of x. The part of x that overlaps with y could contain all of z, and z might not touch the boundary of this overlap.
8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This is not possible. If x and z were equal, then x would be completely inside y without touching y's boundary. But we know that x partially overlaps with y, so some part of x is outside y.

Wait, let me reconsider the possibilities for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):

For TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, can z be inside x and touch x's boundary? 

Let's visualize this:
- y is a region.
- z is a region inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- x partially overlaps with y.

For z to be inside x and touch x's boundary, the boundary of x would need to cut through the interior of y (because z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary). This is possible! The boundary of x can indeed cut through the interior of y, and z can be positioned such that it's inside both x and y, and it touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also possible for similar reasons. z can be positioned such that it's inside both x and y, and it doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Let's validate the other possibilities once more:

For DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. The part of x that overlaps with y might not intersect with z at all.

For EC(x,z): This requires x and z to touch at a boundary but not share interior parts. This is possible if the boundary of x cuts through the interior of y and touches z's boundary.

For PO(x,z): This requires x and z to share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y partially overlaps with z.

For TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But since part of x is outside y, and z is entirely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z): This means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, since part of x is outside y, and z is entirely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. But since x partially overlaps with y, and z is entirely inside y, x and z cannot be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, I'm still not sure if I'm interpreting the relationship between x and z correctly, especially for the cases TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me try a different approach.

Let's be a bit more formal and think of these regions in terms of sets.

PO(x,y) means that the intersection of x and y is non-empty, and neither x is a subset of y, nor y is a subset of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper subset of y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's reason about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means the intersection of x and z is empty. Given that z is inside y, and part of x is also inside y, is it possible for x and z to have an empty intersection? Yes, the part of x that's inside y might not overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Given that z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, can the boundary of x touch the boundary of z? Yes, the boundary of x can cut through the interior of y and touch the boundary of z.

3. PO(x,z) - Partial overlap: This means the intersection of x and z is non-empty, and neither x is a subset of z, nor z is a subset of x. This is possible if the part of x that's inside y partially overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This means x is a proper subset of z, and x touches the boundary of z. But since part of x is outside y, and z is entirely inside y, x cannot be a subset of z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This means x is a proper subset of z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. Again, since part of x is outside y, and z is entirely inside y, x cannot be a subset of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: This means z is a proper subset of x, and z touches the boundary of x. This is possible. The part of x that's inside y can contain all of z, and z can touch the boundary of x (which might cut through the interior of y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: This means z is a proper subset of x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is also possible. The part of x that's inside y can contain all of z, and z can be positioned such that it doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This means x and z are the same set. Since part of x is outside y, and z is entirely inside y, x and z cannot be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Alright, to summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me draw some diagrams to verify the EC(x,z) case. I'm a bit skeptical about whether this is truly possible.

Hmm, let's see. If y is a larger circle, and z is a smaller circle inside y, not touching y's boundary. And x is a circle that partially overlaps with y. Then:

For EC(x,z): x and z would need to touch at a point, but not share interior parts. Given that z doesn't touch y's boundary and is inside y, is it possible for x to touch z at a single point without having any shared interior parts?

I think this is possible. The boundary of x can cut through the interior of y and touch the boundary of z at a single point. So, EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Let me double-check the other possibilities:

For DC(x,z): x and z don't share any parts. This is definitely possible. The part of x that's inside y might not overlap with z at all.

For PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if the part of x that's inside y partially overlaps with z.

For TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. The part of x that's inside y can contain all of z, and z can touch the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also possible. The part of x that's inside y can contain all of z, and z can be positioned such that it doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me verify the case of EC(x,z) once more to be sure. If z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, can there be a configuration where x and z only touch at a point and don't share interior parts?

Actually, I'm having trouble visualizing a configuration where x and z only touch at a point. Given that z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, it seems challenging to have x touch z at just a point without having any shared interior parts.

Actually, I think it is possible!

Consider:
- y is a large circle.
- z is a smaller circle inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- x is a circle that partially overlaps with y in such a way that the boundary of x passes through y and just touches the boundary of z at a single point. The interior of x that's inside y doesn't overlap with the interior of z.

So, EC(x,z) is indeed a valid possibility.

Let me double-check the other relationships once more, taking a different approach for clarity:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are completely separate. This is possible if the part of x that's inside y doesn't intersect with z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is possible, as I reasoned above.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if the part of x that's inside y partially overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that part of x is outside y, and z is entirely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, given that part of x is outside y, and z is entirely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. The part of x that's inside y can contain all of z, and z can touch the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also possible. The part of x that's inside y can contain all of z, and z can be positioned such that it doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. Given that part of x is outside y, and z is entirely inside y, x and z cannot be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I believe this is the final list of possibilities. These are all consistent with the given constraints: PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let me try a slightly different approach to test the case of EC(x,z) once more:

If PO(x,y), then x can be positioned such that it partially overlaps with y. The boundary of x cuts through y, so there's a part of x inside y and a part outside y.

If NTPPi(y,z), then z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, can x and z be in an EC relationship? Yes, the boundary of x can cut through y in such a way that it just touches the boundary of z at a single point. The interior of x that's inside y doesn't overlap with the interior of z.

So, EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Let's once more check the final list of possible relationships between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z):
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm now confident in this list of possibilities.

Actually, let's just think about the EC(x,z) case one more time. Let's say that the boundary of z is B(z). In EC(x,z), there would need to be a point p such that p is in B(z) and p is in B(x), the boundary of x. But we can't have any points q such that q is in the interior of z and q is in the interior of x. Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, the boundary of z is also inside y. So, the boundary of x would need to cut through y in such a way that it touches the boundary of z, but the interior of x doesn't overlap with the interior of z.

I'm becoming increasingly skeptical about the possibility of EC(x,z). Let's visualize it one more time:
- y is a large circle.
- z is a smaller circle inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- Can x be a shape such that it partially overlaps with y, and it touches z at exactly the boundary without having any interior overlap?

Actually, I can visualize a configuration where EC(x,z) is possible. Imagine y as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside y, and x as a shape that cuts through y in such a way that it just touches the boundary of z at a point or a segment. The key is that the interior of x doesn't overlap with the interior of z.

But let me examine the definition of EC(x,z) closely:

EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

Now, let's reason step by step:
- z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- x partially overlaps with y.
- For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at a boundary but not share interior parts.

Given that z is inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible for the boundary of x to cut through y in such a way that it touches the boundary of z, but the interior of x doesn't overlap with the interior of z.

So, yes, EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z) - Disconnected.
- EC(x,z) - Externally connected.
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap.
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

This list is consistent with the given constraints and the definitions of the RCC-8 relations.

Actually, I just realized something about the EC(x,z) case. I was thinking of 2D shapes, where two shapes can touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts. But the definition of EC might be more general. In any case, the key is that for EC(x,z), x and z must touch at a boundary but not share interior parts.

Given the constraints PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), it's plausible for x and z to be in an EC relationship. The boundary of x can cut through y in such a way that it touches the boundary of z without the interiors of x and z having any overlap.

So, I'm sticking with the final list:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But actually, let me try to visualize this yet one more time. If z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, the boundary of z is also inside y. For x and z to be in an EC relationship, the boundary of x would need to cut through y in such a way that it touches the boundary of z at a point or segment, but the interior of x doesn't overlap with the interior of z. This seems like a contrived configuration, but it's geometrically possible. So, EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

I'm now (finally) confident in this list of possibilities:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are consistent with the given information: PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap (they share some parts, but neither is contained in the other).

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y - z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let me analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y might not intersect with z at all.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Possible. The boundary of x can cut through y in such a way that it touches z's boundary without their interiors overlapping.

3. PO(x,z) - Partial overlap: Possible. The part of x inside y can partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Not possible. Since part of x is outside y (by PO(x,y)), and z is completely inside y, x cannot be contained in z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Not possible. For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: Possible. z can be completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: Possible. z can be completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y, not touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Not possible. Since part of x is outside y, and z is completely inside y, they cannot be equal.
