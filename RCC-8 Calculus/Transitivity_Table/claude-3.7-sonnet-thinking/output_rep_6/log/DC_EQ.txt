PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

First, let's understand what these conditions mean:
- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (they are the same region).

Since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), this means that y and z occupy exactly the same space. Therefore, any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

So if DC(x,y), and y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), then the relationship between x and z must be:

DC(x,z)

This is the only possible relationship because z is essentially the same as y from a spatial perspective.

To verify this, let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Since DC(x,y) and z is the same as y, this must be true.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. This can't be true because x doesn't touch y (as DC(x,y)), and z is the same as y.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This can't be true because x doesn't overlap with y, and z is the same as y.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This can't be true because x is not part of y, and z is the same as y.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This can't be true because x is not part of y, and z is the same as y.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This can't be true because y is not part of x, and z is the same as y.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This can't be true because y is not part of x, and z is the same as y.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This can't be true because x and y are not coincident (they're disconnected), and z is the same as y.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relation(s) can hold between x and z given the stated conditions.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent, any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), and z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
