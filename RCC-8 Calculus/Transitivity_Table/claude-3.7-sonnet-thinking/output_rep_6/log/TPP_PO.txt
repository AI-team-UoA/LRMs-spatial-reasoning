PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between regions x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let me understand what these given relations mean:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is completely contained within y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is contained in the other.

To find the possible relations between x and z, I need to consider the spatial configuration systematically. 

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z and analyze whether it's compatible with the given conditions:

1. DC(x,z) - Can x and z be disconnected?
   If x is completely inside y, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x falls within the part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Can x and z externally connect?
   Since x touches the boundary of y (due to TPP(x,y)), and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x touches z at exactly the point where both touch the boundary of y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Can x and z partially overlap?
   If x is inside y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x overlaps with the part of z that's inside y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Can x be a tangential proper part of z?
   If x is a tangential proper part of y, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x is completely inside the overlapping region of y and z, with x touching the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Similar to the above, if x is inside y, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x is completely inside the overlapping region of y and z, without touching the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Can z be a tangential proper part of x?
   If x is a proper part of y, then x is smaller than y. Since z partially overlaps with y and is not contained in y, z cannot be completely contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Can x and z be equal?
   If x is a proper part of y, and z partially overlaps with y, they cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me check to make sure these results are correct by visualizing the relationships.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   If x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z would be disconnected. This seems valid.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect:
   If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y and z also meet, then x and z would externally connect. This seems valid.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   If x overlaps with the intersection of y and z, but also has parts outside this intersection, then x and z would partially overlap. This seems valid.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   If x is completely within the overlap of y and z, and touches the boundary of z, then x would be a tangential proper part of z. This seems valid.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   If x is completely within the overlap of y and z, and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. This seems valid.

Let me double-check the invalid relations:

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   If z is a proper part of x, then z must be smaller than x. But x is a proper part of y, so x is smaller than y. Given that z partially overlaps with y, z cannot be smaller than x. This is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   If x is a proper part of y, and z partially overlaps with y, they cannot be equal in size. This is not possible.

So, my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me think a bit more about this. The fact that z partially overlaps with y means that some part of z is outside of y. So, if x is completely inside y (which is the case since TPP(x,y)), then x cannot contain z entirely. This means that TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are indeed not possible, as I concluded above.

And the fact that x is a proper part of y, while z only partially overlaps with y, means that x and z cannot be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is also not possible, as I concluded above.

So, I believe my analysis above is correct. The possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let's be more careful here. 

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely contained within y, and x touches the boundary of y at at least one point.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some common interior part, but neither is contained in the other. This means some part of y is outside of z, and some part of z is outside of y.

Now, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   If x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z, then x and z would be disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect:
   If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y and z also meet, then x and z would externally connect. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   If part of x is in the overlap of y and z, and part of x is in y but not in z, then x and z would partially overlap. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   If x is completely within the overlap of y and z, and x touches the boundary of z, then x would be a tangential proper part of z. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   If x is completely within the overlap of y and z, and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   If z is a proper part of x, then z must be smaller than x. But x is a proper part of y, so x is smaller than y. And z partially overlaps with y, which means z extends outside of y in some areas. Since x is completely within y, z cannot be completely within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   If x is a proper part of y, and z partially overlaps with y (with some parts of z outside of y), then x and z cannot be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I believe this analysis is correct.

Actually, let me be more precise in my thinking to double-check. I want to make sure that the constraints of TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) are satisfied.

TPP(x,y) means:
1. x is a proper part of y (x is completely inside y).
2. x touches the boundary of y.

PO(y,z) means:
1. y and z share some interior points.
2. Some part of y is outside of z.
3. Some part of z is outside of y.

Now, let's consider each of the RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This means x and z don't share any points. Given that x is completely inside y, and y overlaps with z, it's possible that x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So, DC(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect:
   This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. Given that x touches the boundary of y (due to TPP(x,y)), and z overlaps with y, it's possible that x touches z exactly at the boundary. So, EC(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other. Given that x is inside y, and y overlaps with z, it's possible that x overlaps with the part of z that's inside y. So, PO(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This means x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z. Given that x is inside y and y overlaps with z, it's possible that x is in the overlap region and touches the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Similar to the above, it's possible that x is in the overlap region of y and z, and doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This means z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x. But given that x is a proper part of y (due to TPP(x,y)), and z has parts outside of y (due to PO(y,z)), z cannot be completely inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. For the same reason as above, this is not consistent with the given constraints.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This means x and z are the same region. But given that x is a proper part of y, and z has parts outside of y, x and z cannot be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

So, I confirm that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 spatial relations are possible between regions x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other)

I'll examine each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: 
   Possible if x is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   Possible if x touches the boundary of y at a point where y and z meet.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   Possible if x overlaps with the intersection of y and z, but also has parts outside this intersection.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   Possible if x is completely within the overlap of y and z, and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   Possible if x is completely within the overlap of y and z, without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part:
   Not possible because x is inside y while z extends outside y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part:
   Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   Not possible because x is contained in y while z extends beyond y.
