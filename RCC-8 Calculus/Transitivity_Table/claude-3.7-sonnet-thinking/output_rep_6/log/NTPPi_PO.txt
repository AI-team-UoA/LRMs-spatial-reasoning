PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what possible RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z, given that NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let's make sure I understand the relations:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y does not touch x's boundary. In other words, y is completely contained within the interior of x.

2. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share some parts but neither is contained in the other.

Given these two relations, I need to figure out what relations are possible between x and z.

Since y is properly contained in x (from NTPPi(x,y)), and z partially overlaps with y (from PO(y,z)), we know that z at least shares some part with x (the part it shares with y). But beyond that, there are multiple possibilities.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is not possible because we know z shares a part with y, and y is completely contained in x. So x and z must share at least some part.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at the boundary.
   This is not possible for the same reason as DC. Since z overlaps with y and y is completely within x, z must share some interior part with x.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. z could overlap with y (which is inside x) but also extend outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is not possible because x contains y, and y is not contained in z (due to PO(y,z)). So x cannot be contained in z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. z could be completely contained within x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. z could be completely contained within the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This is not possible because z partially overlaps with y, but y is properly contained in x. If x and z were equal, then z would properly contain y, not partially overlap with it.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me just double-check this by thinking about concrete examples for each possible relation:

For PO(x,z): Imagine x is a large circle, y is a small circle completely inside x, and z is a circle that partially overlaps with y and extends beyond the boundary of x. Here we have NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and PO(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z): Imagine x is a large circle, y is a small circle completely inside x, and z is a circle that partially overlaps with y, is completely inside x, and touches x's boundary. Here we have NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z): Imagine x is a large circle, y is a small circle completely inside x, and z is a circle that partially overlaps with y and is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Here we have NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

So my answer is that the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, actually, I just realized I missed one thing. TPPi(x,z) means that z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary. But if z is partially overlapping with y, and y is completely in the interior of x (away from the boundary), it's not immediately clear if z can both overlap with y and touch the boundary of x.

Let me reconsider: if y is completely contained in the interior of x (NTPPi(x,y)), and z partially overlaps with y (PO(y,z)), then:

1. z must overlap with at least a portion of y (which is entirely in the interior of x)
2. z must also extend beyond y (otherwise it would be TPP or NTPP to y, not PO)
3. This extension of z beyond y could either:
   a. Stay completely within x, not touching x's boundary -> NTPPi(x,z)
   b. Stay completely within x, touching x's boundary -> TPPi(x,z)
   c. Extend outside of x -> PO(x,z)

So TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible. z could overlap with part of y and extend to touch the boundary of x while still being completely contained within x.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider EQ(x,z) as well. I said it's not possible because if z partially overlaps with y, and y is properly contained in x, then z cannot be equal to x. Let me verify this with a concrete example:

If x = y, then NTPPi(x,y) would mean NTPP(y,x), which would be NTPP(x,x). But this contradicts the definition of NTPP, because a region cannot be a proper part of itself. So x cannot equal y.

Now, if x = z, then PO(y,z) would become PO(y,x). But we already know that NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x. And if y is a proper part of x, then they cannot partially overlap (PO). So x cannot equal z.

Therefore, EQ(x,z) is indeed not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I think I made a slight error in my reasoning for EQ(x,z). Let me redo that check:

If NTPPi(x,y), then NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
If PO(y,z), then y and z partially overlap.
If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region.

Combining these: if x and z are the same region (EQ(x,z)), and y is a proper part of x (NTPP(y,x)), then y would also be a proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)). But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says y and z partially overlap.

So EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I just realized I also need to check DC(x,z) more carefully.

If NTPPi(x,y), then y is properly contained within the interior of x.
If PO(y,z), then y and z share some parts.
If DC(x,z), then x and z are disconnected.

But if y is contained in x, and z shares parts with y, then z must share parts with x (via the shared parts with y). This contradicts DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for EC(x,z), if x and z only touch at the boundary, they don't share any interior parts. But since z shares parts with y, and y is completely in the interior of x, z must share interior parts with x. This contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), we need x to be a proper part of z. But we know y is a proper part of x, and y partially overlaps with z. If x were a proper part of z, then y would also be a proper part of z (by transitivity), which contradicts PO(y,z). So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

Okay, in summary, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

This is my final answer.

Let me look at concrete examples to make sure:

For DC(x,z):
x is a circle on the left, y is a smaller circle inside x, z is a circle on the right that doesn't touch x. This satisfies NTPPi(x,y) but not PO(y,z), as y and z would be disconnected, not partially overlapping.

For EC(x,z):
x is a circle on the left, y is a smaller circle inside x but not touching x's boundary, z is a circle on the right that touches x's boundary. This satisfies NTPPi(x,y) but not PO(y,z), as y and z would be disconnected, not partially overlapping.

For PO(x,z):
x is a large circle, y is a small circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), z is a circle that overlaps with y and extends beyond x's boundary. This satisfies both NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), resulting in PO(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a proper part of z, and y is a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of z, not partially overlapping with z. So this can't satisfy PO(y,z).

For NTPP(x,z):
Same reasoning as TPP(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z):
x is a large circle, y is a small circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), z is a circle that overlaps with y, is completely inside x, and touches x's boundary. This satisfies both NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), resulting in TPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z):
x is a large circle, y is a small circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), z is a circle that overlaps with y and is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This satisfies both NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), resulting in NTPPi(x,z).

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are the same region, and y is a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of z, not partially overlapping with z. So this can't satisfy PO(y,z).

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me verify with a different approach. Given:

NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap

We know that:
- y is completely contained in the interior of x
- y and z share some parts but neither is contained in the other

For z's relation to x, we have these facts:
- z shares some parts with y, which is inside x, so z and x must share some parts
- z extends beyond y (since PO(y,z)), but this extension could be:
  - still completely within x, not touching x's boundary -> NTPPi(x,z)
  - still completely within x, touching x's boundary -> TPPi(x,z)
  - extending outside of x -> PO(x,z)

So the possible relations are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

This is my final answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let me analyze what these given relations tell us:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is completely contained within the interior of x (y is a non-tangential proper part of x)
- PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap - they share some parts, but neither is contained in the other

Now I'll examine what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. Since y is completely contained in x, and z overlaps with y, then z must share at least some part with x (the part it shares with y).

2. The remaining part of z (that doesn't overlap with y) could:
   - Remain completely within x without touching x's boundary → NTPPi(x,z)
   - Remain completely within x while touching x's boundary → TPPi(x,z)
   - Extend outside of x → PO(x,z)

3. Let's check why other relations are impossible:
   - DC(x,z) or EC(x,z): Impossible because z shares interior parts with y, which is inside x
   - TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z): Impossible because if x were contained in z, then y would be properly contained in z (not partially overlapping)
   - EQ(x,z): Impossible because if x equals z, then z would properly contain y, contradicting PO(y,z)

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
