PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some parts, but not all. And since TPP(y,z), we know that y is entirely contained within z, touching z's boundary.

Let's go through each of the 8 RCC-8 relations to see which ones are possible between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
   This would mean x and z share no parts. But since x shares some part with y, and y is entirely contained in z, x must share some part with z as well. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y is at the boundary of z, and the rest of x is outside of z.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   This would mean x and z share some parts, but neither is contained entirely in the other. This is possible if part of x overlaps with y (which is within z), but part of x is outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   This would mean x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z, and x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   This would mean x is entirely contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely contained within z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse (z is a tangential proper part of x):
   This would mean z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. But we know y is entirely contained within z, and y overlaps with x but is not entirely contained within x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse (z is a non-tangential proper part of x):
   This would mean z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But similar to TPPi, this is not possible because y is entirely contained within z, and y overlaps with x but is not entirely contained within x.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   This would mean x and z are the same region. But we know y is a proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y. So x and z cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for TPPi and NTPPi:

For TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be fully contained in x. We know that y is fully contained in z (from TPP(y,z)). And we know that y is partially overlapping with x (from PO(x,y)), which means some part of y is outside of x.

If z were fully contained in x, then y would also be fully contained in x (since y is fully contained in z). But this contradicts the fact that y partially overlaps with x, and some part of y is outside of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

I believe the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) - externally connected
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part

Let me verify once more:

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

1. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. Since PO(x,y), there's some part of x that's also part of y. And since TPP(y,z), all of y is inside z. So part of x is inside z, which means x and z share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

2. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. Since PO(x,y), there's some part of x that's also part of y. And since TPP(y,z), all of y is inside z. So part of x is inside z. But we also know from PO(x,y) that some part of x is outside of y. This part of x could be inside or outside of z. If it's outside of z, then PO(x,z) is true.

3. TPP(x,z): This means x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since PO(x,y), there's some part of x that's also part of y. And since TPP(y,z), all of y is inside z and y touches z's boundary. So part of x is inside z. But we also know from PO(x,y) that some part of x is outside of y. If this part of x is still inside z and x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is true.

4. NTPP(x,z): This means x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP(x,z), if all of x is inside z, but x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is true.

Now, let's reconsider EC(x,z): Could it be the case that the part of x that's outside of y touches z's boundary, but doesn't share any interior parts with z? Given that y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)), and x overlaps with y (from PO(x,y)), there's some part of x that's inside z. This means x and z share interior parts, so EC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

In fact, I need to be more careful about the definition of PO. PO(x,y) means that x and y share some spatial part, and neither is a part of the other. So some part of x is outside of y, and some part of y is outside of x.

Given that TPP(y,z), y is entirely within z, touching z's boundary. So the part of y that's outside of x is inside z. And the part of x that's inside y is also inside z. The part of x that's outside of y could be inside or outside of z.

If all of x is inside z, then either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) is true, depending on whether x touches z's boundary.

If some part of x is outside of z, then PO(x,z) is true.

Could DC(x,z) be true? No, because some part of x is inside y, and all of y is inside z, so some part of x is inside z.

Could EC(x,z) be true? No, because some part of x is inside y, and all of y is inside z, so some part of x is inside z. This means x and z share interior parts, so they can't be just externally connected.

So, in summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I think it's still possible for EC(x,z) to be true. Let me think more carefully.

PO(x,y) means x and y share some part, but neither is part of the other. So, some part of x is outside of y, and some part of y is outside of x.

TPP(y,z) means y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's consider EC(x,z). This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

I previously claimed this is not possible because some part of x is inside y, and all of y is inside z, so some part of x is inside z. But this reasoning is flawed. PO(x,y) doesn't necessarily mean some part of x is inside y; it means x and y share some part. 

Actually, "share some part" typically means they have some common interior region, not just a boundary. So, since x and y share some interior part (from PO(x,y)), and all of y is inside z (from TPP(y,z)), it does mean some interior part of x is inside z. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible, because EC implies they only touch at boundaries and don't share interiors.

To be more precise, the partial overlap relation PO(x,y) is typically defined to mean that the interiors of x and y intersect, but neither is a subset of the other. Given this understanding, some interior part of x is inside the interior of y. Since all of y is inside z (from TPP(y,z)), it follows that some interior part of x is inside the interior of z. Therefore, x and z can't be merely externally connected; they must share interior parts.

So, in summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually let me double-check EC(x,z) one more time, because I'm not feeling confident. 

Let's look at the definition of the relations again:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches y's boundary.

EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. For this to be true, the shared part between x and y would have to only be on the boundary of z. But from TPP(y,z), we know that y is entirely inside z. This means the shared part between x and y is inside z, making it impossible for x and z to only touch at the boundary without sharing any interior.

I'm confident now that the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z): If part of x is outside of z.
- TPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

Actually, let me try to draw this out spatially:

1. PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap.
2. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

Consider the situation where z is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary, and x is a circle that partially overlaps with y.

If x is positioned such that it's partly inside y and partly outside y but still entirely inside z, then TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) could be true, depending on whether x touches z's boundary.

If x is positioned such that it's partly inside y and partly outside z, then PO(x,z) is true.

Given that TPP(y,z), y must touch z's boundary. And given PO(x,y), x must overlap with y in a non-trivial way. Is it possible for x to be entirely outside of z but still touch z's boundary? If so, EC(x,z) would be true. But, because x overlaps with y, and y is entirely inside z, at least part of x must be inside z. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, in summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me consider EC(x,z) once more, just to be doubly sure. Could x and z be externally connected?

We have PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z). 

PO(x,y) means x and y share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other. TPP(y,z) means y is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior parts. 

Since PO(x,y), there's some interior part of x that's also interior to y. Since TPP(y,z), all of y, including its interior, is inside z. This means that the shared interior part of x and y is also interior to z. Therefore, x and z share interior parts, making EC(x,z) impossible.

So, in summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Lastly, let's check if it's possible for DC(x,z) (disconnected) to be true.

DC(x,z) means x and z share no parts and are not connected. 

Since PO(x,y), x and y share some interior parts. Since TPP(y,z), all of y is inside z. Therefore, the shared part of x and y is also inside z. This means x and z share some parts, making DC(x,z) impossible.

Likewise, TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are all impossible because they would require z to be inside x, or x and z to be the same, which contradicts the given conditions.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I'm sure now.

Actually, I'm still not 100% satisfied with my reasoning. Let me do one more check. I'll try a different approach, using a more concrete example.

Imagine z as a large circle. Now, place a smaller circle y inside z such that it touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)). Finally, place circle x such that it partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)). We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given PO(x,y), some part of x is inside y, and some part of x is outside y. Also, some part of y is inside x, and some part of y is outside x.

Given TPP(y,z), all of y is inside z, and y touches z's boundary.

Now, let's consider the different positions of x relative to z:

1. If x is positioned such that it's partly inside y and partly outside z, then PO(x,z) is true.

2. If x is positioned such that it's entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is true.

3. If x is positioned such that it's entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is true.

Could x be entirely outside of z? No, because x shares some part with y, and all of y is inside z. Therefore, x must share some part with z.

Could x only touch z's boundary without having any interior overlap with z? No, because x shares interior parts with y, and all of y is inside z. Therefore, x must share interior parts with z.

I believe this confirms that the only possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But actually, let's triple-check just to be super sure. Let's approach this from a different angle.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper subset of z, and y touches z's boundary.

Let's consider the basic constraints of the RCC-8 relations:

- DC (disconnected): x and z share no points.
- EC (externally connected): x and z share boundary points but no interior points.
- PO (partially overlapping): x and z share interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP (tangential proper part): x is a proper subset of z, and x touches z's boundary.
- NTPP (non-tangential proper part): x is a proper subset of z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.
- TPPi (inverse tangential proper part): z is a proper subset of x, and z touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi (inverse non-tangential proper part): z is a proper subset of x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EQ (equal): x and z are the same set.

Given PO(x,y), we know that x and y share interior points. Given TPP(y,z), we know that all of y is inside z. Therefore, the shared interior points of x and y are also inside z. This means x and z share interior points.

This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), as they both require that x and z don't share interior points.

Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z. And given PO(x,y), part of y is outside of x. This means that there are points in z (specifically, those in y but outside of x) that are not in x. Therefore, z is not a subset of x. This rules out TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

So, the remaining possibilities are:
- PO(x,z): If there are points in x that are outside of z.
- TPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, in summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This is my final answer.

Actually, let me clarify one last thing. I've been referring to "shared interior points" which has been causing me some confusion in understanding PO. Let me clarify what PO means.

PO(x,y) means that x and y overlap in a non-trivial way, but neither is contained in the other. It doesn't necessarily mean they share interior points; they might just share boundary points. But in the context of RCC-8, PO means they do share interior points, not just boundaries. 

But actually, I think it's more precise to say that PO(x,y) means that the interiors of x and y intersect, but neither interior is a subset of the other. In the RCC-8 calculus, this aligns with the notion of sharing parts, but not being contained.

Now, given PO(x,y), we know that the interiors of x and y intersect. Given TPP(y,z), all of y, including its interior, is inside z. Therefore, the part of x's interior that intersects with y's interior is also inside z's interior. This means the interiors of x and z intersect.

This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Also, given TPP(y,z), we know y is a tangential proper part of z. Given PO(x,y), some part of y is outside of x. Since all of y is inside z, this means there are points in z that are not in x. Therefore, z is not a subset of x. This rules out TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

So, the remaining possibilities are:
- PO(x,z): If there are points in x that are outside of z.
- TPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let me actually give a concrete example of each of these.

For PO(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary, and x as a circle that partly overlaps with y and partly extends outside of z.

For TPP(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary at a single point p, and x as a circle that partly overlaps with y and is entirely inside z, also touching z's boundary at point p.

For NTPP(x,z): Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z and touching z's boundary, and x as a circle that partly overlaps with y, is entirely inside z, and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, in summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Ok, that concludes my thinking. My final answer is:

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some part, but neither is contained in the other
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

I'll analyze what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, some part of x must be inside z (the part that overlaps with y).

2. The part of x that's outside y could either:
   - Also be inside z → making x completely inside z
   - Extend outside z → making x partially overlap with z

3. If x is completely inside z, it could either:
   - Touch z's boundary → TPP(x,z)
   - Not touch z's boundary → NTPP(x,z)

4. If x extends outside z → PO(x,z)

Important: x must share interior points with z (due to overlap with y), so DC and EC are impossible. And since y is inside z but not inside x, z cannot be contained in x, ruling out TPPi, NTPPi and EQ.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
