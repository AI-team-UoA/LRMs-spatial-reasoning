PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's first recall the definitions of the relations mentioned in the question:

NTPPi(x,y) means x properly contains y, and y does not touch x's boundary. In other words, y is inside x with a gap between y and x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given these two facts. Let's think about the spatial arrangement:

- y is properly contained within x, with a gap between y and x's boundary.
- z touches y at the boundary, but shares no interior points with y.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's consider each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z touches y at the boundary but does not intersect with x at all. However, this would contradict the fact that y is properly contained within x. Since y touches z, and y is properly contained within x, z must at least touch x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points. This is possible if z touches y at the boundary, and that boundary point is also on the boundary of x. However, we know from NTPPi(x,y) that y does not touch x's boundary, so this arrangement isn't possible. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z touches y at the boundary and extends both inside and outside of x. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if z includes all of x and more, and x touches z's boundary. However, we know y is properly contained in x (with a gap), and z touches y. This means z must at least touch a point that is properly inside x, and thus x cannot be a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's take a step back. 

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points.

Given these, z touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. So z at least reaches inside x to touch y's boundary.

Let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. As established, this is not possible because z must reach inside x to touch y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points. This is not possible because z must reach inside x to touch y, so z must share some interior points with x.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z touches y at the boundary and extends both inside and outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, it's not possible for x to be completely inside z and still have y inside it touching z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is even less possible than TPP(x,z) for the same reason. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that z touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, it's possible for z to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given that z touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, it's possible for z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This would mean x and z are the same region. Since y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y at the boundary, it's not possible for x and z to be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I think I'm misinterpreting the constraints. Let's carefully analyze them:

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points.

Given these, z touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. So z must at least reach inside x to touch y's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z must reach inside x to touch y's boundary.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points. This is not possible because z must reach inside x to touch y's boundary, so z must share some interior points with x.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z touches y at the boundary, extends inside x to do so, and also extends outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is not possible because if x were completely inside z, then y would also be completely inside z (since y is completely inside x). But then z would not just touch y at the boundary; it would contain y, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is even less possible than TPP(x,z) for the same reason.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that z touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, it's possible for z to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given that z touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, it's possible for z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This would mean x and z are the same region. This is not possible because if x and z were the same region, then y would be completely inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me think more carefully about NTPPi(x,z). This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But we know z touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Is it possible for z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary and still touch y at the boundary?

Yes, it's possible. Both y and z could be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, but touching each other at their boundaries.

Now let's reconsider TPPi(x,z). This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that z touches y at the boundary and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, is it possible for z to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary?

Yes, it's possible. z could be completely inside x, touching x's boundary, and also touching y at the boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Hmm, I think I may be making a mistake in my analysis. Let me try a slightly different approach. 

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points.

Given these, let's visualize the situation. We have a region x. Inside x, not touching x's boundary, is region y. Region z touches y at the boundary but does not overlap with y.

The constraint EC(y,z) means z touches y at the boundary. Now, z could extend beyond x, or it could be completely inside x. If z extends beyond x, then x and z would partially overlap (PO). If z is completely inside x, then z could either touch x's boundary (TPPi) or not touch x's boundary (NTPPi).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually I think there are a few more options to consider. 

If EC(y,z), then z touches y's boundary. So z could be completely outside x, with just one point touching y's boundary, which is inside x. But that would mean z touches x's boundary at that same point. This would make EC(x,z) possible.

Actually no, that can't happen. Since y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), there's a gap between y and x's boundary. So if z touches y's boundary, z must be at least partially inside x, and it can't be completely outside x touching x's boundary.

Hmm, but there's another case. What if z is much larger than both x and y, and contains x as a proper part? In that case, z would also contain y as a proper part, which contradicts EC(y,z). So z cannot contain x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let's double-check these:

PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Given that z touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside x, z must share some interior points with x. And if z extends beyond x, then neither is contained in the other, making PO(x,z) possible.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and also touches y's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, and touches y's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

All three of these seem valid, so my answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me check once more. 

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x) which means y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points.

Let's go through all eight RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z touches y's boundary, and y is completely inside x, so z must at least reach inside x to touch y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points. This is not possible because z touches y's boundary, and y is completely inside x not touching x's boundary, so z must share some interior points with x.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z touches y's boundary, extends inside x to do so, and also extends outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is not possible because if x were completely inside z, then y would also be completely inside z (since y is completely inside x). But then z would not just touch y at the boundary; it would contain y, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is even less possible than TPP(x,z) for the same reason.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that z touches y's boundary and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, it's possible for z to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given that z touches y's boundary and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, it's possible for z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This would mean x and z are the same region. This is not possible because if x and z were the same region, then y would be completely inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I'm not 100% convinced that TPP(x,z) is impossible. Let me think about it once more.

TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. 

But if x is completely inside z, then y would also be completely inside z (since y is completely inside x). But then z would not just touch y at the boundary; it would contain y, contradicting EC(y,z).

Actually, no, that's not necessarily true. We know y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and x touches z's boundary. It's still possible for y to touch z's boundary even though y does not touch x's boundary.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If y does not touch x's boundary and x touches z's boundary, how can y touch z's boundary? For y to touch z's boundary while being completely inside x, z's boundary would have to penetrate inside x to reach y, which means z and x would overlap, not one being a proper part of the other.

So TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

By the same logic, NTPP(x,z) is also impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me try to draw this out to make sure I'm understanding correctly.

For NTPPi(x,y), we have:
```
+-------------------+
|         x         |
|                   |
|    +-------+      |
|    |   y   |      |
|    |       |      |
|    +-------+      |
|                   |
+-------------------+
```

For EC(y,z), z touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y:
```
+-------------------+
|         x         |
|                   |
|    +-------+      |
|    |   y   |      |
|    |       |      |
|    +-------+      |
|       ^           |
|       |           |
|   +---+---+       |
|   |   z   |       |
|   |       |       |
|   +-------+       |
|                   |
+-------------------+
```
In this case, z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, so we have NTPPi(x,z).

Alternatively, z could extend beyond x:
```
+-------------------+
|         x         |
|                   |
|    +-------+      |
|    |   y   |      |
|    |       |      |
|    +-------+      |
|       ^           |
|       |           |
+-------|-------+   |
|   +---+---+   |   |
|   |   z   |   |   |
|   |       |   |   |
|   +-------+   |   |
|               |   |
+---------------+---+
```
In this case, x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other, so we have PO(x,z).

Or, z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary:
```
+-------------------+
|         x         |
|                   |
|    +-------+      |
|    |   y   |      |
|    |       |      |
|    +-------+      |
|       ^           |
|       |           |
|   +---+---+       |
|   |   z   |       |
|   |       |       |
|   +-------+       |
|       |           |
+-------|-----------|
        |           |
        +-----------+
```
In this case, z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, so we have TPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually I made an error in my diagram for TPPi(x,z). TPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x, so z should be completely inside x. And it is, but I made an error in the bottom part of the drawing. Let me fix that:

```
+-------------------+
|         x         |
|                   |
|    +-------+      |
|    |   y   |      |
|    |       |      |
|    +-------+      |
|       ^           |
|       |           |
|   +---+---+       |
|   |   z   |       |
|   |       |       |
|   +-------+       |
|       |           |
|       v           |
+-------------------+
```

This is still unclear because it doesn't show z touching x's boundary. Let me try again with a different representation.

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

```
+-------------------+
|         x         |
|                   |
|    +-------+      |
|    |   y   |      |
|    |       |      |
|    +-------+      |
|       ^           |
|       |           |
|       |           |
|  +----+----+      |
|  |    z    |      |
|  |         |      |
|  +---------+      |
|             \     |
|              \    |
+-------------------+
```

Where the `\` indicates that z touches x's boundary.

Actually, let's step back and think about this problem differently. 

Given NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Given EC(y,z), we know that z touches y at the boundary but does not overlap with y.

The key is to figure out where z can be in relation to x, given these constraints.

1. z could be partially inside and partially outside x. In this case, x and z would partially overlap, so PO(x,z).

2. z could be completely inside x, touching x's boundary. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z).

3. z could be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. In this case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPPi(x,z).

4. z could be completely outside x, with just a point of contact with x's boundary. But this isn't possible because y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary. So z must at least reach inside x to touch y's boundary.

5. z could completely contain x. But this isn't possible because if z contained x, it would also contain y (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, wait, I still don't think I've been clear enough about EC(x,z). Let me analyze this more carefully.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points. Given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), is EC(x,z) possible?

NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points.

So, z touches y's boundary. Since y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, for z to touch y's boundary, z must at least reach inside x. This means z and x share some interior points, which contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

So I still think the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, maybe I haven't thought about this deeply enough. 

Consider this: we have NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z). Could we possibly have DC(x,z)? That is, could x and z be completely disconnected?

NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at the boundary but do not share any interior points.

If x and z are completely disconnected, then z could not reach inside x to touch y's boundary. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Could we have EC(x,z)? That is, could x and z touch at the boundary but not share any interior points?

If EC(x,z), then z touches x's boundary but doesn't reach inside x. But then z couldn't touch y's boundary, since y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Could we have TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)? That is, could x be a proper part of z?

If TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z. Since y is completely inside x, y would also be completely inside z. But then z wouldn't just touch y's boundary; it would contain y, contradicting EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

Could we have EQ(x,z)? That is, could x and z be the same region?

If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. Since y is completely inside x, y would also be completely inside z. But then z wouldn't just touch y's boundary; it would contain y, contradicting EC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

What about PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z)?

PO(x,z) means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Given that z touches y's boundary, and y is completely inside x, z must share some interior points with x. And if z extends beyond x, then neither is contained in the other, making PO(x,z) possible.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and also touches y's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, and touches y's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I'll analyze what we know:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

2. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Given these constraints, let me determine all possible relationships between x and z:

First, let's rule out some relationships:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because z touches y's boundary, and y is inside x, so z must at least reach inside x.
- EC(x,z) is impossible because z must penetrate into x's interior to touch y.
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because if x were inside z, then y would be completely inside z (not just touching it).
- EQ(x,z) is impossible because if x and z were identical, z would contain y, not just touch it.

The possible relationships are:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This happens when z reaches inside x to touch y but also extends outside x.

2. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary while also touching y's boundary.

3. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary, but touches y's boundary.
