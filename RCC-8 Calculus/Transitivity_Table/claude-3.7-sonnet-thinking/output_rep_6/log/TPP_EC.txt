PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm asked to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's analyze what each of these given relations means:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is completely contained within y, and x touches the boundary of y at some point.
- EC(y,z) means that y is externally connected to z. In other words, y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now, to determine the possible relationships between x and z, I'll think about the spatial configurations that could occur:

1. Since x is contained within y (TPP(x,y)), and y only touches z at the boundary (EC(y,z)), one possibility is that x doesn't touch z at all. This would mean x and z are disconnected, which is the DC relation.

2. Another possibility is that x touches the boundary of y precisely at a point where y touches z. In this case, x would be externally connected to z, giving us the EC relation.

3. Could x partially overlap with z (PO)? No, because x is completely inside y, and y doesn't overlap with z (they only touch at the boundary).

4. Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)? No, because x is inside y, and z is outside y except for the boundary.

5. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)? No, for the same reason as above.

6. Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)? No, because z is outside y (except at the boundary), and x is inside y.

7. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)? No, for the same reason as above.

8. Could x and z be equal (EQ)? No, because x is inside y, and z is outside y (except at the boundary).

So, the possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) or EC(x,z).

Let's double check this: 
- DC(x,z) occurs when x is inside y but doesn't touch the boundary of y where y touches z.
- EC(x,z) occurs when x touches the boundary of y exactly where y touches z.

Yes, these are the only two possibilities: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z).

However, upon further reflection, there's one more case I need to consider:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x touches the boundary of y. But it doesn't specify exactly where x touches the boundary of y. If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch z, then x and z would be disconnected (DC). But if x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches z, then x and z would be externally connected (EC).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is inside y and doesn't touch z.
- EC(x,z): x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches z.

Let's just confirm:

We have:
TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y: All of x is within y.
- x touches the boundary of y.

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries.
- y and z do not overlap.

Given these two facts, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z):
   If x doesn't touch the boundary of y at a point where y touches z, then x and z do not connect, making them disconnected.

2. EC(x,z):
   If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches z, then x and z would touch at that point, making them externally connected.

So, the answer is DC(x,z) or EC(x,z).

Wait, I need to ensure I've considered all cases correctly. Let's revisit the definitions:

- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

Given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (all of x is within y).
- x touches the boundary of y.

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries.
- y and z do not share any interior points.

Now, thinking through the possible spatial configurations:

1. DC(x,z): 
   If x is contained within y but doesn't touch the boundary of y at a point where y touches z, then x and z would not share any points, making them disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): 
   If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches z, then x and z would touch at that point, making them externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): 
   For x and z to partially overlap, they must share some interior points. But since y and z don't share interior points (EC(y,z)) and x is entirely within y (TPP(x,y)), x and z can't share interior points either. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): 
   For x to be a tangential proper part of z, all of x must be within z, and x must touch the boundary of z. But given that x is entirely within y (TPP(x,y)) and z doesn't share interior points with y (EC(y,z)), x can't be entirely within z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): 
   Similarly, for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, all of x must be within z and not touch the boundary of z. For the same reasons as above, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): 
   This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that z is outside y (except at the boundary) and x is inside y, z cannot be entirely within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): 
   Similarly, z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): 
   For x and z to be equal, they must coincide exactly. Given that x is inside y and z is outside y (except at the boundary), they can't coincide. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are indeed:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)

And no other RCC-8 relation is possible given the constraints.

OK, my final answer is DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze the spatial configurations given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely contained within y
- x touches y's boundary

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share any interior points

Given these constraints, there are two possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This occurs when x is inside y but doesn't touch the boundary of y at any point where y touches z. In this case, x and z are completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This occurs when x touches the boundary of y exactly at a point where y touches z. In this case, x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior points.

No other RCC-8 relation is possible because:
- x cannot overlap with z (since x is inside y, and y only touches z at the boundary)
- x cannot be part of z or vice versa (due to their positions relative to y)
- x and z cannot be equal (since x is inside y while z is outside except at boundary points)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
