PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me reason step by step about what we know:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are exactly the same spatial region. This means that any spatial relationship that y has with x, z must also have the same relationship with x.

We know that TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. Since z is exactly the same as y (due to EQ(y,z)), z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z), which means that z is a tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me double check my logic. 

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. But that's not right. TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y). So TPPi(x,y) means that TPP(y,x), i.e., x is a tangential proper part of y.

So TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:

1. x is a tangential proper part of y (from TPPi(x,y)).
2. y is equivalent to z (from EQ(y,z)).

Given these two facts, x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z), which means that x is a tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me check once more.

TPPi(x,y) means that the relation between x and y is the inverse of TPP. So if TPP(a,b) means "a is a tangential proper part of b", then TPPi(a,b) means "b is a tangential proper part of a".

So, TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z:

1. y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
2. y is equivalent to z (from EQ(y,z)).

Given these two facts, z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

Actually I think I'm confusing myself by flip-flopping. Let's get precise with the definitions:

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y.
TPPi(x,y) means the inverse, which is TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x.

So given TPPi(x,y), this means y is a tangential proper part of x.
And given EQ(y,z), this means y and z are coincident.

Since y and z are coincident (exactly the same spatial region), and y is a tangential proper part of x, it follows that z is also a tangential proper part of x.

So the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,x)).

Wait, I think I'm getting confused by the notation. Let me just reason using the direct relation names, and then translate to the given notation:

- TPP(a,b) means "a is a tangential proper part of b".
- The inverse of TPP(a,b) is TPP(b,a), which means "b is a tangential proper part of a".
- TPPi(a,b) is defined as the inverse of TPP(a,b), which is TPP(b,a).

So, TPPi(a,b) means "b is a tangential proper part of a".

Now, given TPPi(x,y), it means "y is a tangential proper part of x".
And given EQ(y,z), it means "y and z are coincident".

Since y and z are the same spatial region, and y is a tangential proper part of x, it follows that z is also a tangential proper part of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z).

I believe TPPi(x,z) is the correct answer, but let me double check by considering the transitivity table for RCC-8 relations, which specify which relations can hold between regions related by each pair of the 8 relations.

Actually I'm not going to rely on the transitivity table. Let me just reason step by step, since we have simple relations here.

Given:
1. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident.

Reasoning:
1. Since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), they occupy exactly the same spatial region. This means that any spatial relationship that involves y can be replaced with z, and the relationship will still hold.
2. Since y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y)), and y is the same spatial region as z (EQ(y,z)), it follows that z is also a tangential proper part of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z), which means that z is a tangential proper part of x.

Actually I have a concern now that I might be missing something subtle. Let me directly re-interpret the original definitions from scratch. The information I'm given:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). So TPPi(x,y) means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x). So NTPPi(x,y) means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Ok, with these definitions clearly in mind. 

TPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident.

Since y and z are coincident (exactly the same spatial region), and y is part of x and touches x's boundary, it follows that z is also part of x and touches x's boundary.

So the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

OK, I've been consistent in my conclusion for a while, so I think the answer is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me see if there's a mistake in my reasoning, since I keep feeling the need to double-check. 

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they are the same spatial region.

If y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, and z is exactly the same as y, then z is also a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z), which means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

But now that I think about it: 

What if x = y? Then TPPi(x,y) would be a contradiction, since a region cannot be a proper part of itself. Similarly, if y = z (from EQ(y,z)), then x = z, and TPPi(x,z) would be a contradiction.

But the premise is that TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a proper part of x, not the same as x. So we know that x ≠ y. And since y and z are the same (from EQ(y,z)), we also know that x ≠ z.

So, the relationship between x and z is still TPPi(x,z).

Actually, one final check. Let's restate the RCC-8 relations:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). So TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x). So NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they are the same spatial region.

Given these two statements, z must also be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary, because z is the same as y. So, the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Now, I should double-check if the problem allows for any other relationships.

Let me reason more rigorously. From the RCC-8 algebra, we know that:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident.

From EQ(y,z), we can substitute z for y in any relation involving y, because they are the same spatial region. So, from TPPi(x,y), we get TPPi(x,z), which means that z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

There's no room for ambiguity here. The relationship between x and z is uniquely determined as TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double check using the RCC-8 composition table to ensure that I haven't overlooked anything. The composition table specifies the possible relations that can hold between two regions x and z, given the relations between x and y, and between y and z.

From TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the composition table entry for TPPi ∘ EQ specifies the possible relations between x and z.

From RCC-8 composition table, the entry for TPPi ∘ EQ would be exactly TPPi. This confirms that the only possible relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is TPPi(x,z).

OK, given the premises TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z given two pieces of information:

1. TPPi(x,y) - This means that y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary)
2. EQ(y,z) - This means that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since y and z are coincident (exactly the same spatial region), any spatial relationship that y has with another region must also hold for z with that same region.

Given that y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and z is identical to y (from EQ(y,z)), it follows that z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is:

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
