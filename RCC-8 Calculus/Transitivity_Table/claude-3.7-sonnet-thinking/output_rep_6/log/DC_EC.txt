PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between regions x and z, given that:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- EC(y,z): y and z externally connect (touch at their boundaries but don't overlap)

Let me think through what's possible:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected.
   This is certainly possible. For example, imagine y as a region between x and z, where y touches z but not x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z could touch at their boundaries.
   This is possible. Imagine x and z both touching y at different parts of y's boundary, and also touching each other.

3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap.
   This is possible. x could be completely separate from y, while z overlaps with a part of x while also externally connecting to y.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. Imagine x being inside z but touching z's boundary, while y touches z from the outside.

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. Imagine x being completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), while y touches z from the outside.

6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. Imagine z being inside x but touching x's boundary, while y touches z at its boundary (which is also x's boundary at that point).

7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. Imagine z being completely inside x, while y touches z at its boundary (but y doesn't touch x).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal.
   This doesn't seem possible because if x = z, then y would have to both be disconnected from x (given DC(x,y)) and externally connect to z (given EC(y,z)). Since x = z in this scenario, y can't both be disconnected from and externally connected to the same region.

Wait, I need to reconsider some of these. Let's think more carefully.

For TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x):
If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would have to also touch x (since the boundary point where y and z meet is also on x's boundary). But this contradicts DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x):
If z is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y touches z at its boundary, then y would have to penetrate into x to touch z. This means y and x would at least be externally connected, which contradicts DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) as well:

For TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z):
This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is disconnected from x but externally connected to z, y must touch z at a part of z's boundary that x doesn't touch. This is possible.

For NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z):
This means x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. Since y is disconnected from x but externally connected to z, y must touch z at its boundary, which is separate from x. This is possible.

So the possible relations between x and z, given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connect
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, let me double-check PO(x,z) again:
For PO(x,z) (x and z partially overlap):
If x and z partially overlap, and y is disconnected from x but externally connected to z, then y must touch z at a part of z's boundary that is outside of the overlap with x. This is possible.

So my final answer for the possible relations between x and z is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me just sanity check this one more time:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries

For each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be disconnected from both y and z.
2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z at its boundary while still being disconnected from y.
3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can overlap with z while still being disconnected from y (as long as y touches z at a part not overlapping with x).
4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a proper part of z touching z's boundary, while y touches z at a different part of its boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a proper part of z not touching z's boundary, while y touches z at its boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is a proper part of x touching x's boundary, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would also have to touch x, contradicting DC(x,y).
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is a proper part of x not touching x's boundary, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would have to be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y can't both be disconnected from x and touch z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap

Analyzing each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can be completely separate from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can touch z at its boundary while remaining disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially overlap with z while staying disconnected from y (as long as y touches z at a part not overlapping with x).

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be inside z and touch z's boundary, while y touches z at a different part of its boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), while y touches z from the outside.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible - If z were inside x and touching x's boundary, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would have to touch x as well, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - If z were completely inside x, and y touches z, then y would have to penetrate x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - If x equals z, then y cannot both be disconnected from x and touching z.
