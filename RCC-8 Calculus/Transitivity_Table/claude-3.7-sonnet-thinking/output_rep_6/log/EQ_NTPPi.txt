PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully work through this step by step.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (identical in terms of spatial extent)
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y

Now, let's understand what NTPPi(y,z) means more precisely:
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y)
- NTPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary

Since EQ(x,y), x and y occupy exactly the same space. They are identical in spatial terms.

Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (from NTPP(z,y)), and x is coincident with y (from EQ(x,y)), then z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

To verify: 
- z is completely inside y without touching its boundary (from NTPP(z,y))
- x is exactly the same as y (from EQ(x,y))
- Therefore, z must be completely inside x without touching its boundary

The only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to double-check my reasoning. Let me make sure I understand NTPPi correctly:

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

If EQ(x,y), then x and y are exactly the same spatial region.

So if z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and x equals y, then z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z given the two stated conditions.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (spatially identical)
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary)

Because EQ(x,y) means x and y are spatially identical, any spatial relationship that y has with another region must also apply to x with that region.

Since NTPPi(y,z) means that z is completely contained within y without touching y's boundary, and x is identical to y, then z must also be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
