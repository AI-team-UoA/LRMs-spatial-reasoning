PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think through the possible relationships between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other. 
EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

Now I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z. Let's go through the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
This is possible. If x partially overlaps with y, but is mostly contained in a region that doesn't touch z, then x and z could be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries
This is possible. If part of x touches the boundary of y exactly where y touches z, then x could touch z at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
This is possible. If x extends beyond y in a way that overlaps with z, then x and z could partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
This is possible. If x is positioned in such a way that it's entirely within z but touches z's boundary, then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
This is possible. If x is positioned entirely within the interior of z, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) - z is a tangential proper part of x
This is possible. If z is positioned in such a way that it's entirely within x but touches x's boundary, then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
This is possible. If z is positioned entirely within the interior of x, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
This is possible. Although less obvious, it could be that x and y partially overlap, y and z externally connect, and x and z are actually the same region.

Actually, let me be more careful with some of these. Let me double-check each one:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
Yes, this is possible. If x partially overlaps with y but doesn't extend to the part of y that touches z, then x and z would be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries
Yes, this is possible. If part of x touches the boundary of y exactly where y touches z, then x could touch z at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
Yes, this is possible. If x extends beyond y in a way that overlaps with z, then x and z could partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
I need to be more careful here. TPP means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. 
If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to consider if x can be fully contained within z while touching z's boundary.
Let's imagine y is a circle that touches z at a point. If x is a smaller circle that partially overlaps with y, x could potentially be completely contained in z while touching z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) seems possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
Similarly, if x is smaller and positioned in a way that it's entirely within z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) - z is a tangential proper part of x
If z is positioned entirely within x and touches x's boundary, while y externally connects with z and partially overlaps with x, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
If z is positioned entirely within the interior of x, without touching x's boundary, while y externally connects with z and partially overlaps with x, then NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
On second thought, I don't think this is possible. If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), then x partially overlaps with y, while y and z only touch at their boundaries. If x and z were equal, then x would have to both partially overlap with y and only touch y at the boundary, which is contradictory. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me think more carefully about some of these relations.

TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
If x partially overlaps with y and y externally connects with z, can x be fully contained in z? 
Let's think of it this way: PO(x,y) means that some part of x is outside of y. This part that's outside y would need to be completely inside z for TPP(x,z) to hold. But at the same time, some part of x is inside y, and y only touches z at the boundary. It's hard to see how the part of x inside y could be inside z if y and z only touch at their boundaries. So I'm doubtful about TPP(x,z).

Actually, it might be possible if the part of x that's inside y is exactly at the boundary of y where y touches z. But this is a very specific configuration, and I'm not sure if it's generally possible.

Let me be more rigorous. PO(x,y) means:
- There is some point p that is both in x and in y.
- There is some point q that is in x but not in y.
- There is some point r that is in y but not in x.

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z share a boundary point but no interior points.
- For every point p, if p is in the interior of y, then p is not in z.

For TPP(x,z) to be true:
- Every point in x must also be in z.
- There must be some point in z that is not in x.
- x must touch the boundary of z.

Now, let's see if these can be consistent. If PO(x,y), then there's a point p that's in both x and y. Since EC(y,z), if p is in the interior of y, then p is not in z. But for TPP(x,z), every point in x must be in z. This creates a contradiction if p is in the interior of y. 

However, if p is on the boundary of y where y touches z, then p could be in z as well, and we might avoid the contradiction. But this seems like a very specific case.

Hmm, actually let me check if I've been thinking about these relations correctly. 

PO(x,y) means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. 
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
TPP(x,z) means x is part of z and touches z's boundary.

So for TPP(x,z) to hold, x must be entirely within z, touching z's boundary. If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior points, and some of x is outside y. For EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interiors.

I think the issue is: if x partially overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, how can x be entirely within z? 

It seems problematic because any part of x that's inside y would have to be at the boundary of y where y touches z for it to be inside z. And any part of x outside of y would need to be entirely inside z. This feels like a very constrained configuration.

Let me reconsider.

Actually, let me simply construct models for the possible relations.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
Imagine x is a small circle that partially overlaps with y on the left side of y, and z is another circle that touches y on the right side. In this case, x and z would be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries:
Imagine x is a circle that partially overlaps with y, and part of x's boundary coincides with the part of y's boundary that touches z. Then x and z would touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
Imagine x partially overlaps with y, and x extends beyond y in a way that it also overlaps with z. Then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
This is a bit trickier. If x partially overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, it's hard to see how x could be entirely contained within z while touching z's boundary. I think this relation is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
Similarly, if x partially overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, it's hard to see how x could be entirely contained within the interior of z. I think this relation is also impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
Imagine z is a small circle that's entirely within x but touches x's boundary. Imagine y is a circle that externally connects with z at a point and partially overlaps with x. Then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
Imagine z is a small circle that's entirely within the interior of x, not touching x's boundary. Imagine y is a circle that externally connects with z at a point and partially overlaps with x. Then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
As I discussed earlier, I believe this relation is impossible.

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try a more straightforward approach. I'll draw out some examples.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
Imagine three circles: x on the left, y in the middle, and z on the right. x overlaps with the left part of y, and z touches the right part of y without overlapping. In this scenario, x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries:
Imagine y as a rectangle. x is a circle that overlaps with the left half of y, and its rightmost point is at the center of y. z is a circle that touches the right edge of y at a point, and this point is aligned with the center of y. In this scenario, x and z would touch at a single point.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
Imagine y as a rectangle again. x is a circle that overlaps with the left half of y and extends a bit to the right of y's center. z is a circle that touches the right edge of y at a point and extends to include part of the area to the right of y's center. In this scenario, x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
I'm still struggling to see how this is possible. If y only touches z at the boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, how can x be entirely within z?

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
Similarly, I'm struggling to see how this is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
Imagine y as a large circle. x is a larger circle that overlaps with a significant portion of y. z is a small circle that touches the edge of y at a point, and this small circle is entirely contained within the overlapping region of x and y, touching the boundary of x. In this scenario, z would be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
Similar to the above, but z is entirely within the interior of x, not touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
I still believe this relation is impossible.

Actually, let me think about TPP(x,z) more. Let me try to give a specific example to see if it's possible. Let's consider a 2D space.

Imagine y as a unit square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1). Now, imagine z as a larger square with corners at (-0.5, -0.5), (1.5, -0.5), (1.5, 1.5), and (-0.5, 1.5). 

y and z touch at the edges of y, so EC(y,z). 

Now, let's define x as a rectangle with corners at (0.5, 0), (1, 0), (1, 0.5), and (0.5, 0.5). x is partially inside y (overlapping the bottom-right corner of y), so PO(x,y).

Now, is x entirely inside z? Yes, because z contains all of y's boundaries and extends beyond.
Does x touch the boundary of z? No, because x is entirely within the interior of z.

So in this case, we have NTPP(x,z).

Let me try another example for TPP(x,z).

Imagine y as a unit square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1). Now, imagine z as a larger square with corners at (-0.5, -0.5), (1.5, -0.5), (1.5, 1.5), and (-0.5, 1.5). 

y and z touch at the edges of y, so EC(y,z). 

Now, let's define x as a rectangle with corners at (0, 0), (0.5, 0), (0.5, 0.5), and (0, 0.5). x is partially inside y (overlapping the bottom-left corner of y), so PO(x,y).

Now, is x entirely inside z? Yes, because z contains all of y's boundaries and extends beyond.
Does x touch the boundary of z? Yes, because the point (0,0) is on the boundary of z.

So in this case, we have TPP(x,z).

Wait, I think there's an error in my reasoning. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. In my examples, y and z share a boundary, but z includes all of y's boundaries, which I think is inconsistent with EC(y,z).

Let's revise my understanding of EC(y,z). It means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior points. So they share at least one boundary point, but no interior points.

Let me try again.

Imagine y as a unit square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1). Now, imagine z as another unit square with corners at (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), and (1,1). 

y and z touch at the edge from (1,0) to (1,1), so EC(y,z). 

Now, let's define x as a rectangle with corners at (0.5, 0), (1.5, 0), (1.5, 0.5), and (0.5, 0.5). x overlaps with the bottom half of y and the bottom part of z, so PO(x,y) and PO(x,z).

So in this case, we have PO(x,z).

Let me try another example for DC(x,z).

Imagine y as a unit square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1). Now, imagine z as another unit square with corners at (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), and (1,1). 

y and z touch at the edge from (1,0) to (1,1), so EC(y,z). 

Now, let's define x as a rectangle with corners at (0, 0), (0.5, 0), (0.5, 0.5), and (0, 0.5). x is partially inside y (overlapping the bottom-left corner of y), so PO(x,y).

x and z don't share any points, so DC(x,z).

Let me try another example for EC(x,z).

Imagine y as a unit square with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1). Now, imagine z as another unit square with corners at (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), and (1,1). 

y and z touch at the edge from (1,0) to (1,1), so EC(y,z). 

Now, let's define x as a rectangle with corners at (0.5, 0), (1, 0), (1, 0.5), and (0.5, 0.5). x is partially inside y (overlapping the bottom-right corner of y), so PO(x,y).

x and z touch at the edge from (1,0) to (1,0.5), so EC(x,z).

Now let's try to check if TPP(x,z) is possible. 

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. This means every point of x is in z, and x touches the boundary of z.

I'm having a hard time constructing an example where TPP(x,z) holds, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). 

If PO(x,y), then part of x is inside y and part is outside. If EC(y,z), then y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. For TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x would need to be inside z. But the part of x that's inside y can't be inside z (because EC(y,z)). So I think TPP(x,z) is impossible.

Similar reasoning applies to NTPP(x,z). I think it's also impossible.

Let's check if TPPi(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means every point of z is in x, and z touches the boundary of x.

For this to be consistent with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), z would need to be entirely inside x, and y would need to externally connect with z while partially overlapping with x.

I think this is possible. Imagine x as a large square, y as a circle that partially overlaps with x (so PO(x,y)), and z as a small square entirely inside x that touches the boundary of x at a point (so TPPi(x,z)). If y touches z at a boundary (so EC(y,z)), then all three conditions are satisfied.

Let's also check if NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means every point of z is in the interior of x.

Using similar reasoning as for TPPi(x,z), I think NTPPi(x,z) is possible. Imagine x as a large square, y as a circle that partially overlaps with x (so PO(x,y)), and z as a small square entirely inside the interior of x (so NTPPi(x,z)). If y touches z at a boundary (so EC(y,z)), then all three conditions are satisfied.

Finally, let's check if EQ(x,z) is possible.

EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region.

If PO(x,y), then part of x is inside y and part is outside. If EC(y,z), then y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. So x would both partially overlap with y and externally connect with y, which is contradictory. So I think EQ(x,z) is impossible.

To summarize, based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x)
- NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x)

Actually, let's double-check once more to see if TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are indeed impossible:

For TPP(x,z), x must be entirely within z, touching z's boundary. If PO(x,y), then some part of x is inside y. Due to EC(y,z), the interior of y and the interior of z share no points. So any part of x that's inside y cannot be inside z. Hence, x cannot be entirely within z, which means TPP(x,z) is impossible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x must be entirely within the interior of z. If PO(x,y), then some part of x is inside y. Due to EC(y,z), the interior of y and the interior of z share no points. So any part of x that's inside y cannot be inside z. Hence, x cannot be entirely within the interior of z, which means NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning again. I think I might be misunderstanding PO(x,y). Let me go back to the definition.

PO(x,y) means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. There are points that are both in x and y, there are points in x that are not in y, and there are points in y that are not in x.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior points.

So, for PO(x,y), some of x is inside y, and some of x is outside y.

For TPP(x,z) to be possible, given these constraints, all of x would need to be inside z, touching z's boundary. But some of x is inside y, and due to EC(y,z), the interior of y and the interior of z share no points. So the part of x that's inside y cannot be inside z, which means TPP(x,z) is impossible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), all of x would need to be inside the interior of z. But some of x is inside y, and due to EC(y,z), the interior of y and the interior of z share no points. So the part of x that's inside y cannot be inside the interior of z, which means NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

I'm confident now that the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x)
- NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x)

Actually, let me double-check the last two again (TPPi and NTPPi).

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, TPP(z,x).

For this to be possible, z must be entirely inside x, touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary, and given PO(x,y), some of y is inside x and some is outside. It's possible for z to be entirely inside x, touching x's boundary, while also touching the boundary of y. So I think TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, NTPP(z,x).

For this to be possible, z must be entirely inside the interior of x, not touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary, and given PO(x,y), some of y is inside x and some is outside. It's possible for z to be entirely inside the interior of x, not touching x's boundary, while also touching the boundary of y. So I think NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x)
- NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let me recall what these relations mean:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected; they touch at their boundaries but share no interior points

Let me examine each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Possible. If x overlaps with a part of y that's away from where y touches z, then x and z can be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Possible. If x extends to the boundary of y exactly where y touches z, then x can touch z at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - partial overlap: Possible. If x extends beyond y into z, it can partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: Not possible. Since some part of x is inside y (due to PO(x,y)), and the interiors of y and z don't share points (due to EC(y,z)), x cannot be completely contained in z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Not possible. For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: Possible. z can be completely inside x while touching x's boundary, and still externally connect with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: Possible. z can be completely inside the interior of x, not touching x's boundary, while still externally connecting with y.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: Not possible. If x and z were equal, then x would both partially overlap with y and externally connect with y, which is contradictory.
