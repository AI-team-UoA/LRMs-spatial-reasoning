PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this carefully. We have NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). 

NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. In other words, x is completely contained in y's interior.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. In other words, y is completely contained in z's interior.

Given these two facts, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since x is completely contained in y, and y is completely contained in z, it follows that x is completely contained in z. So we know that x must be a part of z. 

The question is: does x touch z's boundary? 

If x touches z's boundary, then we would have TPP(x,z). If x does not touch z's boundary, then we would have NTPP(x,z).

Since x is completely within y, and y is completely within z (not touching z's boundary), there's no way for x to touch z's boundary. So x must be completely within z's interior.

Therefore, we have NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

So x is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside z. This means x is strictly inside z, which is NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relation must hold between x and z given the constraints NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means that x is completely contained within y's interior (not touching y's boundary).
NTPP(y,z) means that y is completely contained within z's interior (not touching z's boundary).

Since x is completely contained within y, and y is completely contained within z's interior, it follows that x must be completely contained within z's interior as well. 

Because y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is strictly inside y, there's no way for x to touch z's boundary. Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
