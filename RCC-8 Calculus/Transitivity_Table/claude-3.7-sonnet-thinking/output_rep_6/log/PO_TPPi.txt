PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's go through this step by step. 

1. We know PO(x,y), which means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. We know TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y), i.e., z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now I need to figure out what these two facts tell us about the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about this spatially:
- x partially overlaps with y. This means there's a part of x in y, and a part of x outside y.
- z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely contained in y, and z touches y's boundary.

Now, for the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Could x and z be disconnected (DC)? Yes, if the part of x that's in y doesn't overlap with z, and the boundaries of x and z don't touch.

2. Could x and z be externally connected (EC)? Yes, if the part of x that's in y doesn't overlap with z, but the boundaries of x and z touch.

3. Could x and z partially overlap (PO)? Yes, if the part of x that's in y partially overlaps with z.

4. Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x))? I don't think so. z is completely contained in y. For z to be a tangential proper part of x, it would need to be completely contained in x. But we know that x is not completely contained in y, so part of x is outside y. But z is completely contained in y. So z can't be completely contained in x.

Actually, let me reconsider this more carefully. The fact that part of x is outside y doesn't preclude z from being contained in x. If the part of x that's in y contains z, then z could be a proper part of x.

But for z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must touch the boundary of x. Since z touches the boundary of y, and y and x overlap partially, it's possible that z also touches the boundary of x at the same point where it touches the boundary of y. So TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x))? I think this is also possible. If the part of x that's in y completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPP(z,x) would hold.

6. Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))? This would mean x is completely contained in z. But we know that x is not completely contained in y, and z is completely contained in y. So this isn't possible.

7. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))? Similarly, this would mean x is completely contained in z. But we know that x is not completely contained in y, and z is completely contained in y. So this isn't possible.

8. Could x and z be equal (EQ(x,z))? This would mean x and z are the same. But we know that x is not completely contained in y, and z is completely contained in y. So this isn't possible.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning for points 4 and 5. Let me reconsider.

For TPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and touch the boundary of x. The fact that z is a tangential proper part of y means z is completely contained in y and touches the boundary of y. 

Now, we know that x and y partially overlap. This means there's a part of x in y, and a part of x outside y. For z to be completely contained in x, the part of x that's in y must completely contain z. Given that z touches the boundary of y, and x also has a part outside y, it's possible that z touches the boundary of x at the point where it also touches the boundary of y. 

So, TPP(z,x) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and not touch the boundary of x. It's possible that the part of x that's in y completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. 

So, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

Given the constraints:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,y)): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(z,x): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(z,x): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Wait, let me double-check this logic. 

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z must have no spatial overlap. Given PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y), we know that z is completely contained in y. For x and z to be disconnected, the part of x that's in y must not overlap with z. This seems possible.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. Given that z touches the boundary of y, and x has a part outside y, it's possible that z touches the boundary of x at the point where it also touches the boundary of y. 

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Given that z is completely contained in y, and x has a part in y, it's possible that x and z share a spatial part. And since x has a part outside y, it's not the case that x is part of z. And for z to not be part of x, there must be a part of z that's not in x. This seems possible.

For TPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and touch the boundary of x. Given that z is completely contained in y, and x has a part in y, it's possible that z is completely contained in the part of x that's in y. And given that z touches the boundary of y, and x has a part outside y, it's possible that z touches the boundary of x at the point where it also touches the boundary of y.

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and not touch the boundary of x. It's possible that the part of x that's in y completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Hmm, let me rethink PO(x,z). For this to be true, x and z must share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. We know that z is completely contained in y, and x has a part in y. It's possible that the part of x that's in y partially overlaps with z, which would mean x and z share a spatial part. And since x has a part outside y, it's not the case that x is part of z. But for z to not be part of x, there must be a part of z that's not in x. This still seems possible.

What about TPPi(x,z) (which is equivalent to TPP(z,x))? For this to be true, x must be completely contained in z and touch the boundary of z. But we know that x has a part outside y, and z is completely contained in y. So x can't be completely contained in z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

And similarly, NTPPi(x,z) (which is equivalent to NTPP(z,x)) is not possible either.

Finally, EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same. But we know that x has a part outside y, and z is completely contained in y. So x and z can't be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(z,x): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(z,x): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Actually, I still made a mistake. I was saying that TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) are possible. Let me check again.

For TPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and touch the boundary of x. We know that z is completely contained in y, and x has a part in y. For z to be completely contained in x, the part of x that's in y must completely contain z. But we also know that x and y partially overlap, which means that part of x is outside y. Given that z touches the boundary of y (from TPP(z,y)), it's possible that z touches the boundary of x at the point where it also touches the boundary of y, if the boundary of x coincides with the boundary of y at that point. So, TPP(z,x) is possible.

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and not touch the boundary of x. For z to be completely contained in x, the part of x that's in y must completely contain z. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPP(z,x) would hold. This is possible if the boundary of x at the region of overlap with y doesn't coincide with the boundary of y where z touches it. So, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

Wait, I made another mistake. TPP(z,y) means z is part of y and touches y's boundary. It doesn't necessarily mean z is completely contained in y; it just means that every part of z is also a part of y. So, z is indeed a proper part of y.

Let me reconsider the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Given PO(x,y), there's a part of x in y. If this part of x doesn't overlap with z, then x and z would be disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Given that z touches the boundary of y, and x has a part outside y, it's possible that x and z touch at the boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. It's possible that the part of x that's in y overlaps with z. Given that x has a part outside y, it's not the case that x is a part of z. And it's possible that not all of z is in the part of x that's in y, which would mean z is not a part of x. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. But we know that x has a part outside y, and z is a proper part of y. So, x can't be a proper part of z. TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Similarly, since x has a part outside y, and z is a proper part of y, x can't be a proper part of z. NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPP(z,x): This means z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. It's possible that the part of x that's in y completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x at the point where it also touches the boundary of y. So, TPP(z,x) is possible.

7. NTPP(z,x): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. It's possible that the part of x that's in y completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. But we know that x has a part outside y, and z is a proper part of y. So, x and z can't be the same. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(z,x) (which is TPPi(x,z)): z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(z,x) (which is NTPPi(x,z)): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

To confirm this, I will try to draw simple pictures for each of these scenarios.

DC(x,z):
Imagine x and y as partially overlapping circles. Now, imagine z as a smaller circle inside y that doesn't overlap with the region where x and y overlap. In this case, x and z are disconnected.

EC(x,z):
Again, imagine x and y as partially overlapping circles. Now, imagine z as a smaller circle inside y that touches the boundary of y at a point where x also touches y. In this case, x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

PO(x,z):
Again, imagine x and y as partially overlapping circles. Now, imagine z as a circle inside y that partially overlaps with the region where x and y overlap. In this case, x and z share a spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

TPP(z,x) (which is TPPi(x,z)):
Imagine x as a circle that partially extends outside of y. Inside the part of x that's in y, imagine z as a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x at a point where x and y also meet. In this case, z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

NTPP(z,x) (which is NTPPi(x,z)):
Imagine x as a circle that partially extends outside of y. Inside the part of x that's in y, imagine z as a smaller circle that doesn't touch the boundary of x. In this case, z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

These all seem possible, given the constraints. So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Wait, I have TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) in the first section, but TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) in the second section. Let me clarify. 

TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x. The inverse, TPPi(x,z), means x is a tangential proper part of z. But I've argued that x can't be a proper part of z, so TPPi(x,z) isn't possible. Similarly, NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and NTPPi(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which I've argued isn't possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Hold on, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify one more time.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which is that z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z must have no spatial overlap. Given that z is contained in y, and x has a part in y, it's possible that the part of x in y doesn't overlap with z. This would make x and z disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. Given that z touches the boundary of y, and x has a part that crosses the boundary of y, it's possible that x and z touch at a boundary. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Given that z is contained in y, and x has a part in y, it's possible that the part of x in y overlaps with z. Given that x has a part outside y, x can't be a part of z. For z to not be a part of x, there must be a part of z that's not in x. This is possible. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely contained in z. But we know that x has a part outside y, and z is completely contained in y. So, x can't be completely contained in z. Thus, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z. Similarly, this would mean x is completely contained in z, which we've established isn't possible. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPP(z,x) to be true, z must be a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. It's possible that the part of x in y completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x at the point where it also touches the boundary of y. So, TPP(z,x) is possible.

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. It's possible that the part of x in y completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be the same. But we know that x has a part outside y, and z is completely contained in y. So, x and z can't be the same. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, that was a mistake. TPPi(x,z) is the same as TPP(z,x). And NTPPi(x,z) is the same as NTPP(z,x). So, they're equivalent.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Ok, let me be careful now. 

TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which is that z is a tangential proper part of x. 

NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which is that z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I think I got TPPi and NTPPi mixed up. Let me clarify once more.

According to the problem statement:
- TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). This means z is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y). This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

But the problem states TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z) (which is TPP(z,y)): z is a tangential proper part of y.

And the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z) (which is TPP(z,x)): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z) (which is NTPP(z,x)): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

To be consistent with the problem statement, I'll express the answer in terms of the original RCC-8 relations, and not their inverses:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Oh, I see the source of my confusion. We are asked about the relationship between x and z. In the RCC-8 calculus, the relation is always expressed as R(x,z), where R is one of the 8 possible relations. So, I should be consistent and express the relations as R(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. (But this isn't possible, as I argued earlier.)
- NTPPi(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. (But this isn't possible, as I argued earlier.)
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. (But this isn't possible, as I argued earlier.)
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. (But this isn't possible, as I argued earlier.)
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. (But this isn't possible, as I argued earlier.)

But there's a problem: the only possible relations I found were DC, EC, PO, TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x). The last two aren't in the form R(x,z). 

Let me re-read the problem statement: "TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

So, TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. 
Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Alright, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

PO(x,y) means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This means x has a part inside y and a part outside y.

TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given these constraints, I'll analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If the part of x inside y doesn't overlap with z, they can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x and z touch at a boundary point (where z touches y's boundary) but don't share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If the part of x inside y partially overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. Since x extends outside y, but z is completely inside y, x cannot be contained in z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as above.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely contained in the part of x that's inside y, and z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely contained in the part of x that's inside y, and z doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since x extends outside y, but z is completely inside y, they cannot be equal.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
