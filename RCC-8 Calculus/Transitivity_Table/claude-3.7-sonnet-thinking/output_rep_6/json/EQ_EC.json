{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region), x must have the same spatial relationship with z that y has with z.\n\nGiven that EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts, the only possible relationship between x and z is also EC(x,z).\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 5.638360500335693, "reasoning-tokens": 320, "completion-tokens": 320}
