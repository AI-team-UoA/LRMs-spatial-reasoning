{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If we have EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.\n\nEQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region).\nEQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident.\n\nSince x and y occupy the same region, and y and z occupy the same region, by transitivity, x and z must also occupy the same region.\n\n### Answer: EQ(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 7.460031270980835, "reasoning-tokens": 490, "completion-tokens": 490}
