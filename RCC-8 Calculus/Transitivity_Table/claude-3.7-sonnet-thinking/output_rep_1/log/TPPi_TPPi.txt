PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We know that TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means the same as TPP(y,x), which means that y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary

From this, I need to determine what are the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Let's reason through the possibilities:

1. Since z is a proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), and y is a proper part of x (TPP(y,x)), it follows that z is a proper part of x (either TPP or NTPP).

2. Now, since z touches y's boundary and y touches x's boundary, z could either:
   a) Touch x's boundary as well (which would make it TPP(z,x))
   b) Be completely inside x, not touching its boundary (which would make it NTPP(z,x))

Both scenarios are possible based on the given information.

Let me provide a concrete example to clarify:

Imagine three concentric circles X, Y, and Z, where Z is the innermost, Y is the middle, and X is the outermost. 

If Y touches the boundary of X (TPP(y,x)) and Z touches the boundary of Y (TPP(z,y)), then Z might or might not touch the boundary of X. If Z touches the boundary of X at the point where Y also touches X, then TPP(z,x). If Z doesn't touch X's boundary at all, then NTPP(z,x).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x), or equivalently, TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let's re-analyze:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y.

So:
- y is properly contained in x, touching x's boundary
- z is properly contained in y, touching y's boundary

This means z is properly contained in x (since z is in y and y is in x). 

Now, the question is: does z touch x's boundary? There are two cases:

1. If z touches x's boundary at the point where y also touches x, then z is a tangential proper part of x, which means TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

2. If z does not touch x's boundary, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me think through this more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

From this, we know:
- y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is contained in y and y is contained in x, z is definitely contained in x.

Now, for the relationship between x and z, we need to determine if z touches x's boundary.

Given that y touches x's boundary and z touches y's boundary, it's possible for z to touch x's boundary if they all touch at the same point. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x, making the relationship TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

However, it's also possible that z touches y's boundary at a point where y does not touch x's boundary. In this case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x, making the relationship NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are consistent with the given conditions, so the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

hmm, actually, I'm still not sure. Let me look at this from a different angle. I want to consider this in a more formal way using the definitions of these spatial relations.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

From this, we can infer that z is a proper part of x (due to the transitivity of the "part of" relation). 

Now, for the relationship to be TPP(z,x), z needs to touch the boundary of x. Given that z touches the boundary of y and y touches the boundary of x, it's not guaranteed that z touches the boundary of x. If z touches y's boundary at a point that is also on x's boundary, then TPP(z,x) holds. Otherwise, if z's contact with y's boundary is at a point inside x (not on x's boundary), then NTPP(z,x) holds.

Both scenarios are possible, so the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x), or equivalently, TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, actually I think the answer is just TPPi(x,z) and I'll explain why.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, z is necessarily a proper part of x. 

Now, the key question is: does z touch the boundary of x?

Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, it might seem like z would also touch the boundary of x. However, it's possible that z touches y's boundary at a point that is inside x, not on x's boundary. In such a case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x, making the relationship NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

On second thought, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let's be clearer:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which implies y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which implies z ⊂ y and z touches the boundary of y.

From these, we can infer that z ⊂ x.

Now, for the relationship between x and z, we need to determine if z touches the boundary of x.

Given that z touches the boundary of y and y touches the boundary of x, it's not guaranteed that z touches the boundary of x. If z's contact with y's boundary is at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x, making the relationship NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

However, if z's contact with y's boundary is at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x, making the relationship TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are consistent with the given conditions, so the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me try to draw this out to make it clearer:

Case 1 (TPPi(x,z)):
x: [                   ]
y:   [               ]
z:     [           ]

Here, z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary. So, z touches x's boundary, making it TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

Case 2 (NTPPi(x,z)):
x: [                   ]
y:   [               ]
z:       [        ]

Here, z touches y's boundary at a point inside x, not on x's boundary. So, z doesn't touch x's boundary, making it NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Based on this analysis, both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z given the conditions TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually let me try to be very concrete about this.

Suppose we have three regions:
- x: A large square
- y: A medium square inside x, touching the boundary of x at one point
- z: A small square inside y, touching the boundary of y at one point

If z touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches the boundary of x. In this case, the relationship is TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

If z touches y's boundary at a different point, which is inside x, then z does not touch the boundary of x. In this case, the relationship is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are consistent with the given conditions, so the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm pretty confident about this answer now, but let me double-check my reasoning once more.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y, and z touches the boundary of y.

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, z is a proper part of x.

Now, the question is: Does z touch the boundary of x?

Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, the answer depends on the specific configuration.

If z touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches the boundary of x. In this case, the relationship is TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

If z touches y's boundary at a point inside x, not on the boundary of x, then z does not touch the boundary of x. In this case, the relationship is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are consistent with the given conditions TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). Therefore, based on the information provided, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I think I might be overcomplicating this. I know for a fact that both regions z and y are tangential proper parts of their containing regions. And in one case (the case of NTPPi(x,z)), I'm saying that z isn't a tangential proper part of x. Let me reconsider:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x at some point.
TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y at some point.

For the relationship between x and z:

1. z is definitely a proper part of x, because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x.

2. The question is: Does z touch the boundary of x?

Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, it's not guaranteed that z touches the boundary of x. I believe I've been conceptualizing "touching the boundary" incorrectly. Let me be clear:

If z touches y's boundary at a point where y meets x's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary. In this case, the relationship would be TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

If z touches y's boundary only at points where y does not meet x's boundary, then z would not touch x's boundary. In this case, the relationship would be NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are compatible with the given conditions, so both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, let's think about this using the formal definitions of RCC-8 primitives.

EC(A, B) means that A and B share no interior points but share boundary points.
TPP(A, B) means that A is a proper part of B and A shares boundary points with B.
NTPP(A, B) means that A is a proper part of B and A does not share boundary points with B.

Given TPPi(x, y), we know TPP(y, x), which means y is a proper part of x and shares boundary points with x. In other words, there's a boundary point b_yx that belongs to both y and x.

Given TPPi(y, z), we know TPP(z, y), which means z is a proper part of y and shares boundary points with y. In other words, there's a boundary point b_zy that belongs to both z and y.

Now, for the relationship between x and z, we first know that z is a proper part of x transitively. The question is whether z shares boundary points with x.

If the boundary point b_zy (shared by z and y) is also the boundary point b_yx (shared by y and x), then z and x share a boundary point. In this case, TPP(z, x) or TPPi(x, z) holds.

If the boundary point b_zy is not a boundary point of x (i.e., it's inside x), then z and x do not share a boundary point. In this case, NTPP(z, x) or NTPPi(x, z) holds.

Both scenarios are compatible with the given conditions, so both TPPi(x, z) and NTPPi(x, z) are possible relationships between x and z.

Let me try to test my answer by drawing some specific configurations.

Scenario 1: Regions are circles or disks.
- x is a large circle centered at the origin.
- y is a smaller circle inside x, tangent to x at one point (say, at (1, 0)).
- z is an even smaller circle inside y, tangent to y at one point.

If z is tangent to y at (1, 0), which is also where y is tangent to x, then z is also tangent to x. In this case, TPP(z, x) or TPPi(x, z) holds.

If z is tangent to y at a point other than (1, 0), then z is inside x but not tangent to it. In this case, NTPP(z, x) or NTPPi(x, z) holds.

Scenario 2: Regions are squares.
- x is a square with corners at (0, 0), (0, 2), (2, 2), and (2, 0).
- y is a smaller square inside x, with one corner at (1, 1) and touching the boundary of x at (2, 1).
- z is an even smaller square inside y, with one corner at (1.5, 1.5) and touching the boundary of y at (1.5, 1) or (2, 1.5).

If z touches y at (2, 1.5), then z is inside x and not touching the boundary of x. In this case, NTPP(z, x) or NTPPi(x, z) holds.

If z touches y at (2, 1), which is also where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. In this case, TPP(z, x) or TPPi(x, z) holds.

Both scenarios confirm that, given TPPi(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), both TPPi(x, z) and NTPPi(x, z) are possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, hold on a minute. Let me go back to the scenario of circles again.

Scenario: Regions are circles or disks.
- x is a large circle/disk with radius 3, centered at the origin.
- y is a circle/disk with radius 1, centered at (2, 0), so that it's inside x and tangent to x at (3, 0).
- z is a circle/disk with radius 0.5, centered at (1.5, 0), so that it's inside y and tangent to y at (1, 0).

Given these configurations, we can see that x is bigger than y, and y is bigger than z. y is tangent to x at (3, 0), which is consistent with TPP(y, x) or TPPi(x, y). z is tangent to y at (1, 0), which is consistent with TPP(z, y) or TPPi(y, z).

Now, is z tangent to x? z has its boundary passing through (1, 0), and x has its boundary passing through (3, 0), (-3, 0), (0, 3), and (0, -3). Clearly, z's boundary does not intersect with x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z, x) or NTPPi(x, z).

Let me try another configuration:
- x is a large circle/disk with radius 3, centered at the origin.
- y is a circle/disk with radius 1, centered at (2, 0), so that it's inside x and tangent to x at (3, 0).
- z is a circle/disk with radius 0.5, centered at (2.5, 0), so that it's inside y and tangent to y at (3, 0).

In this configuration, z is tangent to y at (3, 0), which is also where y is tangent to x. Thus, z is also tangent to x, making the relationship TPP(z, x) or TPPi(x, z).

So, depending on the specific configuration, both TPPi(x, z) and NTPPi(x, z) are possible relationships given TPPi(x, y) and TPPi(y, z).

I'm satisfied with this answer. Given the conditions TPPi(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

ANSWER:

To analyze this problem, I need to understand what these relationships mean and then determine the possible relationships between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x - that is, y is fully contained inside x and touches x's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y - that is, z is fully contained inside y and touches y's boundary.

From these facts, I can deduce:
1. Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, then z must be inside x.
2. The question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not.

There are two possible scenarios:
- If z touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary, then z will also touch x's boundary. This would make their relationship TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).
- If z touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch x's boundary, then z won't touch x's boundary. This would make their relationship NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Both configurations are possible given the constraints.
