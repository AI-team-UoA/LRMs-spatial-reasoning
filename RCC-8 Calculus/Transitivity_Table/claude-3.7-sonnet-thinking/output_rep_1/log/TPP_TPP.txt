PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to find the possible RCC-8 relationships between regions x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's recall what TPP means:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's analyze:

1. Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y (as a proper part), touching y's boundary.
2. Since TPP(y,z), y is inside z (as a proper part), touching z's boundary.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

- Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, we know that x must be inside z (either as a tangential or non-tangential proper part).
- The question is whether x must touch z's boundary or not.

Let's consider the possibilities:

1. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
   - This is possible if x touches the part of y's boundary that also happens to be z's boundary.

2. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
   - This is possible if x is entirely within y, and the part of y's boundary that x touches is not part of z's boundary.

Let me analyze this further:

- TPP(x,y) means x touches y's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary

Does x necessarily touch z's boundary? Not necessarily. It depends on which part of y's boundary x touches:

- If x touches a part of y's boundary that coincides with z's boundary, then x also touches z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) true.
- If x only touches parts of y's boundary that are strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x does not touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) true.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. TPP(x,z)
2. NTPP(x,z)

Let me verify that no other RCC-8 relation is possible:

- DC(x,z): Impossible because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x must be inside z.
- EC(x,z): Impossible for the same reason - x can't be just touching z externally when it's inside y which is inside z.
- PO(x,z): Impossible because x is fully inside y, which is fully inside z, so x must be fully inside z.
- TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z): Impossible because TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) establish that x is smaller than y, which is smaller than z.
- EQ(x,z): Impossible because TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y (not equal), and TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z (not equal).

So, the final answer is: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Analysis:
Since x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, we know that x must be a proper part of z (inside z). The question is whether x touches z's boundary or not.

Two scenarios are possible:
1. If x touches a part of y's boundary that coincides with z's boundary, then x touches z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) true.
2. If x only touches parts of y's boundary that are interior to z, then x doesn't touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) true.

No other relationships are possible because x must be fully inside z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
