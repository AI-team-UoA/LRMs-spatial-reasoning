PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) mean and then reason about their implications for the relationship between x and z.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z externally connect. They touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z given these two relationships?

First, since y is properly inside x (not touching the boundary), and z touches the boundary of y, z must at least touch the interior of x. This means z overlaps with the interior of x to some extent.

But what are the specific possibilities? Let's consider each RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know that z touches y, which is fully inside x. So z must touch x as well. Therefore, DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect. However, since y is properly inside x (not touching the boundary of x), and z touches y, z must overlap with the interior of x. Therefore, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, sharing some parts but not all. This is a possibility because z could overlap with y (which is inside x) and also extend outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. But this would require that z contains x, which means z also contains y (since y is inside x). But that would make it impossible for y and z to be just externally connected as given in EC(y,z). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to the above, if x were a non-tangential proper part of z, then y (being inside x) would also be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. This is a possibility because z could be contained mostly within x, touching its boundary, while also touching y, which is fully inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary. But we know from EC(y,z) that z touches y, which is fully inside x. If z is also fully inside x without touching its boundary, then z and y would overlap in some way, not just externally connect. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) seems to be impossible.

Hmm, I think I might have made an error here. Let me reconsider. 

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x. 

Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. 

Since y is properly inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), and z touches y at its boundary, z could also be entirely inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) might be possible after all.

Let me restart the analysis, approaching it slightly differently.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely contained within x without touching the boundary of x.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

Let's visualize this: y is like a smaller shape completely inside a larger shape x, and z is a shape that touches y along its boundary.

Now, for z's relation to x, there are a few possibilities:

1. z could be partially inside x and partially outside, touching y from the inside of x. In this case, z and x would partially overlap, making PO(x,z) a possibility.

2. z could be entirely inside x, touching y from within x. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility. If z does touch the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

3. z could be touching y from across the boundary of x. But this would mean y touches the boundary of x, contradicting NTPPi(x,y). So this is not a possibility.

Let's visualize each possibility more carefully. I'm considering 2D regions for simplicity:

For PO(x,z): Imagine a circle x, with a smaller circle y entirely inside it. Now consider a third shape z that overlaps with y at a point on y's boundary, and z extends both inside and outside of x. In this configuration, z shares some area with x but not all, hence PO(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z): Again, imagine a circle x with a smaller circle y entirely inside it. Now, z is a shape inside x that touches y on its boundary and also touches the boundary of x. This makes z a tangential proper part of x, inverted. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z): With the same setup of x and y, if z is a shape inside x that touches y on its boundary but doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, inverted. Hence, NTPPi(x,z) is also a possibility.

Given these visualizations, it seems like the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But let me think about this more carefully, especially about the NTPPi case.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x. And we're given that EC(y,z), which means y and z touch at their boundaries.

Since y is non-tangentially inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), and z touches y at its boundary, z could still be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary, making NTPPi(x,z) a valid possibility.

OK, now I see where my earlier error was. I assumed that if z is a non-tangential proper part of x and EC(y, z) holds, then y and z would have to overlap, not just externally connect. But that's wrong because they can touch at their boundaries without overlapping, even if both are inside x.

Let's reconsider the other RCC-8 relations that I might have incorrectly ruled out:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know that z touches y, which is fully inside x. So z must have some kind of connection with x. Therefore, DC(x,z) is indeed impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect. Since y is non-tangentially inside x (i.e., y doesn't touch the boundary of x) and z touches y, if x and z were only externally connected, then z couldn't touch y. This is because to externally connect with x, z would have to be completely outside of x except for at the boundary, and since y is not at the boundary of x, z couldn't touch y. So, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z as well. But EC(y,z) says that y and z only externally connect. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z, touching z's boundary. If x is inside z, then y (being inside x) would also be inside z. This contradicts EC(y,z). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to the above, if x is properly inside z without touching its boundary, then y would be inside z as well, contradicting EC(y,z). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me re-think the TPPi(x,z) case, which means z is a proper part of x that touches the boundary of x.

Given NTPPi(x,y), y is entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x.
Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries.

If z were touching the boundary of x (as in TPPi(x,z)), it would be at a distance from y, since y is non-tangentially inside x. But EC(y,z) says that y and z touch. This seems contradictory.

Let me visualize this again: x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle entirely inside x (not touching the boundary of x), and z touches y at its boundary. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to touch the boundary of x. But if z is touching both y and the boundary of x, and y is not touching the boundary of x, then z would have to "stretch" from y to the boundary of x. In such a case, z would "overlap" with x, not be a proper part of it. So TPPi(x,z) might not be possible.

But then I realize that my visualization for TPPi(x,z) was incorrect. TPPi(x,z) means that z is a proper part of x, tangentially touching the boundary of x. It doesn't necessarily mean that z reaches from y to the boundary of x. It just means that z is inside x and touches the boundary of x at some point. So, z could be a shape inside x, touching y on one side and touching the boundary of x on another side. In this configuration, TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

So, after careful reconsideration, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Now, a final check: Can z also have equal (EQ) relation with x? If x and z are exactly the same, then y would be a non-tangential proper part of z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is certainly ruled out.

Actually, one more careful check for PO(x,z):
If z partially overlaps with x, then part of z would be outside x. But if z also touches y (which is non-tangentially inside x), then z would have to extend from y to outside of x, passing through the boundary of x. In this configuration, z would indeed partially overlap with x, but also extend beyond it. So, PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

So the possible relationships remain:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I think that's our answer.

Actually, wait. Let me think about the boundary points of the regions. In the case where z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPPi(x,z), it's tangentially inside x, so it touches the boundary of x at at least one point. But given EC(y,z), z also touches y at at least one point of y's boundary. If y is non-tangentially inside x, then there's a buffer of space between y and the boundary of x. This means that z would have to be touching both y and the boundary of x, which seems "stretched" and might violate the notion of a tangential proper part.

Maybe I should use the formal definitions of these relations to be more precise.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Formally, this means there's a "buffer" zone in x around y, ensuring y doesn't touch the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. Formally, this means the topological closure of y intersects with the topological closure of z, but the interiors of y and z do not intersect.

Given these definitions, let's reconsider TPPi(x,z):
TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. Formally, this means z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of z and x intersect.

If z touches the boundary of x (as per TPPi(x,z)) and also touches y (as per EC(y,z)), and y is inside x with a buffer (as per NTPPi(x,y)), then it seems like z would have to be somewhat elongated to reach both y and the boundary of x.

Actually, on more thought, there's nothing contradictory here. z could be a shape inside x, touching y on one side and touching the boundary of x on another side. As long as z is entirely inside x and touches the boundary of x at at least one point, it's a tangential proper part of x.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), as long as z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x at any point, it's a non-tangential proper part of x. And it can still touch y at its boundary, satisfying EC(y,z).

For PO(x,z), z shares some space with x but not all. Given EC(y,z), z touches y on its boundary. Since y is inside x, z would have to extend outside of x to satisfy the partial overlap relationship.

So, after all these reconsiderations, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm satisfied with this answer.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking. But I want to do this carefully step-by-step. Let's focus on what each relation means, what constraints we're given, and what's possible.

I know for sure that the possible relations between x and z are not DC, NTPP, TPP, and EQ. This is how I know this:
1. DC(x,z) would mean x and z are disconnected. But since z touches y, which is inside x, z would also have to be connected with x in some way.
2. EC(x,z) would mean x and z externally connect, touching only at their boundaries. If y is inside x (not touching the boundary of x), then for z to touch y, z would have to intrude into x, which would be more than just an external connection.
3. PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. This is a possibility because z could overlap with some of x's interior (including a portion where it touches y) and also extend outside of x.
4. TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is inside z, y would also be inside z (since y is inside x). This would make it impossible for y and z to just externally connect, contradicting EC(y,z).
5. NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, if x is inside z without touching its boundary, y would also be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).
6. TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is a possibility because z could be inside x, touching the boundary of x at some point, and also touching y at its boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is a possibility because z could be entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x, but still touching y at its boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then y would be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

This directly follows from the constraints given by NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) and the behaviors implied by their definitions. I think this is the correct answer.

But actually, let me also check one more step by thinking if the RCC-8 calculus has a composition table that calculates which relations are possible for x and z given relations for x and y, and for y and z. Those tables are usually computed by using the constraints implied by the definitions of the relations, just as I did earlier, so we should get consistent results with those. Let me check:

For NTPPi(x,y) which is the same as NTPP(y,x), the composition table with EC(y,z) might give something like: NTPP(y,x) ∘ EC(y,z) = ?

I don't have that table right now, so I'll rely on reasoning from definitions directly:

1. NTPP(y,x) means y is inside x without touching x's boundary.
2. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

Now, to determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to go through the RCC-8 relations systematically:

a. DC(x,z): This is not possible because z touches y, which is inside x.

b. EC(x,z): This is not possible because for z to touch y, which is inside x, z would have to intrude into x.

c. PO(x,z): This is a possibility. If z partially overlaps with x, then it's outside of x in some areas and inside in others. It could touch y from inside of x.

d. TPP(x,z): This is not possible because if x is a tangential proper part of z, then y, being inside x, would also be inside z. This contradicts EC(y,z).

e. NTPP(x,z): This is not possible for the same reason as TPP.

f. TPPi(x,z): This is a possibility. If z is a tangential proper part of x, then it can touch y from inside of x and also touch the boundary of x.

g. NTPPi(x,z): This is a possibility. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then it can touch y from inside of x without touching the boundary of x.

h. EQ(x,z): This is not possible because if x and z are the same, then y would be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But I think about this and I'm still unsure about PO(x,z). In this case, z would be both inside and outside of x. The part of z that's inside x allows it to touch y (since y is fully inside x). But is it possible for z to touch y if z and y are not overlapping (since they're externally connected)?

Let's break it down again. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries, their interiors do not intersect. Now, if y is inside x (from NTPP(y,x)), and z touches y from inside x, z could still extend beyond x, making PO(x,z) valid. I need to ensure that z's connection with y is only at their boundaries, not in their interiors, which satisfies EC(y,z). And I need to ensure that z partially inside and partially outside of x, which satisfies PO(x,z).

There's no inherent contradiction here. Let me visualize this once more:

x is a circle, y is a smaller circle entirely inside x (not touching the boundary of x), and z is a shape that touches y at its boundary and also extends outside of x. In this configuration, z partially overlaps with x (PO(x,z)) and y and z are externally connected (EC(y,z)).

OK, I think PO(x,z) is a valid possibility, but I need to be careful about my mental visualization. 

But it's time for me to collect my answer. I think I have triple-checked enough at this point. The possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary)
- EC(y,z) means y and z externally connect (they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap)

Now I'll analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible. Since z touches y which is inside x, z must have some connection with x.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible. Since y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y, z must penetrate into x's interior, which is more than just external connection.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. z can touch y from inside x while also extending outside of x, creating a partial overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z): Impossible. If x were inside z, then y would also be inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible. Same reasoning as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x touching x's boundary at some point, while also touching y at its boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) while still externally connecting with y.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x and z were identical, y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).
