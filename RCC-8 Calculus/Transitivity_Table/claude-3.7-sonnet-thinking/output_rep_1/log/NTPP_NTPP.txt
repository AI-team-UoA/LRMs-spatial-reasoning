PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

We're given:
1. NTPP(x,y) - which means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z) - which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z.

Since x is completely inside y, and y is completely inside z, it follows that x must be completely inside z. This is a case of transitivity.

Let's consider the possibilities for the relationship between x and z using the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected. This can't be true because x is inside y which is inside z, so x and z definitely have a connection.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected. This can't be true because x is inside y which is inside z, so x can't touch the boundary of z.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping. This can't be true because x is completely inside z, not just partially.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part. This could be true if x touches the boundary of z. However, given that x is inside y and y doesn't touch the boundary of z (because NTPP(y,z)), x can't touch the boundary of z. So, this can't be true.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part. This is true. x is completely inside y which is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, so x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse. This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This can't be true because x is inside y which is inside z, so z can't be a part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse. This would mean z is a proper part of x without touching x's boundary. This can't be true for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal. This would mean x and z are the same. This can't be true because x is inside y which is inside z, so x must be different from z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). This makes intuitive sense: if x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let's double check there are no mistakes in my reasoning.

NTPP(x,y) means x is properly inside y without touching y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is properly inside z without touching z's boundary.

Now, let's try to determine the relationship between x and z.

Given that x is properly inside y, and y is properly inside z, we can conclude that x is properly inside z. 

Could x touch the boundary of z? 
Since y doesn't touch the boundary of z (due to NTPP(y,z)), and x is inside y (due to NTPP(x,y)), x must be further away from the boundary of z than y is. So, x can't touch the boundary of z.

This confirms that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me just check that I've been reasoning about the relationships correctly in a spatial sense:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
2. TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and does touch y's boundary.
3. PO(x,y) means x and y overlap, but neither is a part of the other.
4. EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
5. DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected.
6. EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same.
7. TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
8. NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given these meanings:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is entirely inside y, without touching y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is entirely inside z, without touching z's boundary.

Since x is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, it logically follows that x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is the definition of NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, now I'm having some second thoughts. Let me visualize this a bit...

If we have a big circle z, and inside it a smaller circle y that doesn't touch the boundary of z, and inside y we have a even smaller circle x that doesn't touch the boundary of y, then x is definitely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is true.

But is there any other potential relationship?

Let's reconsider each of the other 7 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - This can't be true because x is inside z, so they're not disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - This can't be true because x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
3. PO(x,z) - This can't be true because x is entirely inside z, not just partially overlapping.
4. TPP(x,z) - This can't be true because x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
5. TPPi(x,z) - This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know x is inside z, so this can't be true.
6. NTPPi(x,z) - This would mean z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But we know x is inside z, so this can't be true.
7. EQ(x,z) - This would mean x and z are the same, but we know x is inside y which is inside z, so x and z are not the same.

I believe NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually I need to be careful about "inside" here since that's not a precise RCC8 term. Let me be clearer:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So the question is: given these two facts, what relationship exists between x and z?

Well, we know that x is a proper part of y, so all of x is contained within y. And y is a proper part of z, so all of y is contained within z. By transitivity, all of x is contained within z, so x is a part of z.

Now, is x a proper part of z? If x were equal to z, then it would be a part of y, which would contradict NTPP(y,z) (since we'd have z = x, and z is a proper part of y, but that's impossible since z would contain y). So x must be a proper part of z.

Does x touch the boundary of z? If x did touch the boundary of z, then y would also have to touch the boundary of z (since x is a proper part of y), but that contradicts NTPP(y,z). So x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, we have that x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is the definition of NTPP(x,z).

I'm confident that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, I realize I misinterpreted the original RCC8 relations. TPPi(x,y) doesn't mean "the interior of y is a proper part of x", but rather "TPP(y,x)". Similarly, NTPPi(x,y) means "NTPP(y,x)".

Let me think about this again with the correct interpretations.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

Since x is a proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), and y is a proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), x must be a proper part of z by transitivity. So, x is either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

If x were TPP(x,z), then x would touch the boundary of z. But given that y doesn't touch the boundary of z (NTPP(y,z)), and x is a proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), x can't possibly touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Doing a final check:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we deduced that the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let's verify this by ruling out all other relations:

1. DC(x,z) - Can't be true because x is a proper part of z.
2. EC(x,z) - Can't be true because x is a proper part of z.
3. PO(x,z) - Can't be true because x is a proper part of z, not just partially overlapping.
4. TPP(x,z) - Could be true if x touches the boundary of z. But since x is inside y and y doesn't touch the boundary of z, x can't touch the boundary of z. So, it's not true.
5. NTPP(x,z) - This is the relation we deduced.
6. TPPi(x,z) - (i.e., TPP(z,x)) - Can't be true because z can't be a proper part of x when x is a proper part of z.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - (i.e., NTPP(z,x)) - Same reason as above.
8. EQ(x,z) - Can't be true because x is a proper part of z, not equal to z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

So, the answer to "If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me just double check that my definitions of the RCC relations are correct:

1. DC(x,y) - disconnected. x and y do not intersect.
2. EC(x,y) - externally connected. x and y touch at the boundary but their interiors don't intersect.
3. PO(x,y) - partially overlapping. x and y intersect, but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,y) - tangential proper part. x is fully contained in y and x touches the boundary of y.
5. NTPP(x,y) - non-tangential proper part. x is fully contained in y and x doesn't touch the boundary of y.
6. TPPi(x,y) - is the same as TPP(y,x). So, y is fully contained in x and y touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y) - is the same as NTPP(y,x). So, y is fully contained in x and y doesn't touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,y) - x and y are the same.

With these definitions in mind, let's restate our problem:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is fully contained in y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is fully contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

Since x is fully contained in y and y is fully contained in z, x must be fully contained in z by transitivity. Now, we need to determine if x touches the boundary of z.

Since y doesn't touch the boundary of z (due to NTPP(y,z)), and x is fully contained in y and doesn't touch the boundary of y (due to NTPP(x,y)), x cannot touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

Let's double check by ruling out all other possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - Can't be true because x is fully contained in z.
2. EC(x,z) - Can't be true because x is fully contained in z.
3. PO(x,z) - Can't be true because x is fully contained in z, not just partially overlapping.
4. TPP(x,z) - Can't be true because x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z) - This is the relation we deduced.
6. TPPi(x,z) - (i.e., TPP(z,x)) - Can't be true because z can't be fully contained in x when x is fully contained in z.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - (i.e., NTPP(z,x)) - Same reason as above.
8. EQ(x,z) - Can't be true because x is fully contained in z and isn't the same as z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I had a mistake in my interpretation of TPP earlier, so let me clarify:

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.

With this correction, our reasoning remains the same:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we deduced that x is fully contained in z (by transitivity) and doesn't touch the boundary of z (because y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x is inside y). This corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

Alright, I'm confident that given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me just double check the interpretations of the relations:

1. DC(x,y) - x and y are disconnected. They share no points.
2. EC(x,y) - x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior points.
3. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,y) - x is a tangential proper part of y. All of x is contained in y, and x touches the boundary of y.
5. NTPP(x,y) - x is a non-tangential proper part of y. All of x is contained in y, and x doesn't touch the boundary of y.
6. TPPi(x,y) - y is a tangential proper part of x. (It's the inverse of TPP).
7. NTPPi(x,y) - y is a non-tangential proper part of x. (It's the inverse of NTPP).
8. EQ(x,y) - x and y are equal. They occupy the same space.

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), let's analyze:

1. x is fully inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
2. y is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

By transitivity, x is fully inside z. But does x touch the boundary of z?

If x were to touch the boundary of z, there would be a point on x that also lies on the boundary of z. But y is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, meaning there's a "buffer" or gap between y and the boundary of z. Since x is fully inside y, x must also have this buffer from the boundary of z.

Therefore, x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

I'm now fully confident that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation.

So the answer to "If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is NTPP(x,z).

On second thought, let me go back to the original definition of the RCC-8 calculus to be absolutely sure.

RCC-8 is the Region Connection Calculus with 8 basic relations. The foundational relation is C(x,y), which means that regions x and y are connected. From this, the 8 relations are derived:

1. DC(x,y) - x disconnected from y. ¬C(x,y)
2. EC(x,y) - x externally connected to y. C(x,y) ∧ ¬O(x,y)
3. PO(x,y) - x partially overlaps y. O(x,y) ∧ ¬P(x,y) ∧ ¬P(y,x)
4. TPP(x,y) - x is a tangential proper part of y. PP(x,y) ∧ ∃z[EC(z,x) ∧ EC(z,y)]
5. NTPP(x,y) - x is a non-tangential proper part of y. PP(x,y) ∧ ¬∃z[EC(z,x) ∧ EC(z,y)]
6. TPPi(x,y) - y is a tangential proper part of x. TPP(y,x)
7. NTPPi(x,y) - y is a non-tangential proper part of x. NTPP(y,x)
8. EQ(x,y) - x is identical to y. P(x,y) ∧ P(y,x)

Where:
- O(x,y) means x and y overlap, i.e., they share at least one point.
- P(x,y) means x is part of y, i.e., all of x is contained in y.
- PP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, i.e., P(x,y) ∧ ¬P(y,x).

Given these definitions:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and there's no region that's externally connected to both x and y. In other words, x is fully contained within the interior of y.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and there's no region that's externally connected to both y and z. In other words, y is fully contained within the interior of z.

Now, let's reason about the relationship between x and z:

1. Since NTPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y. And since NTPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. By transitivity of the part relation, x is a proper part of z.

2. Is there a region that's externally connected to both x and z? If there were, let's call it w. Then w is externally connected to x. But x is fully contained within the interior of y, which means w must be inside or at least touching y. If w is inside y, then it can't be externally connected to z (since y is fully within the interior of z). If w is touching the boundary of y, it still can't be externally connected to z (for the same reason).

Therefore, there's no region that's externally connected to both x and z, which means NTPP(x,z).

Going back to the 8 basic relations, let's rule out alternatives:

1. DC(x,z) - Can't be true because x is inside z.
2. EC(x,z) - Can't be true because x and z have an overlap.
3. PO(x,z) - Can't be true because x is fully inside z.
4. TPP(x,z) - Can't be true because there's no region that's externally connected to both x and z.
5. NTPP(x,z) - This is our deduced relation.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Can't be true because x is a proper part of z, not the other way around.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Same reason as above.
8. EQ(x,z) - Can't be true because x is a proper part of z, not identical to z.

Thus, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation.

I'm now absolutely confident that given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship between x and z follows from the given conditions NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Let's determine the relationship between x and z:

Since x is entirely contained within y (by NTPP(x,y)), and y is entirely contained within z (by NTPP(y,z)), it follows that x is entirely contained within z by transitivity.

Now I need to determine if x touches z's boundary:
- Since y doesn't touch z's boundary (by NTPP(y,z))
- And x is completely contained within y (by NTPP(x,y))
- Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary

Since x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
