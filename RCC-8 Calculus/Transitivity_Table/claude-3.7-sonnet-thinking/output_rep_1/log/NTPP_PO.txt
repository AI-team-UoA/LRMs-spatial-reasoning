PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what these relations mean:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, x is completely contained within y, and x does not touch y's boundary.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained within the other.

Now, let's determine what the relationship between x and z could be:

Given that x is completely contained within y (NTPP(x,y)), and y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), we need to consider different possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. x could be completely contained within the overlap of y and z. In this case, x would be a proper part of z, either as a tangential proper part (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part (NTPP).

2. x could be completely outside the overlap of y and z, but still within y. In this case, x would be disconnected from z (DC).

3. x could be partly within the overlap of y and z and partly outside it (but still within y). In this case, x would partially overlap with z (PO).

4. x could touch the boundary of z at some point while being completely within y. In this case, x would be externally connected to z (EC).

Let's systematically check which of these are possible:

Case 1: Can x be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP)?
This is possible if x is entirely within the overlap of y and z. Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If the overlap of y and z completely contains x, then x could be a proper part of z. Depending on whether x touches z's boundary, it could be either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

Case 2: Can x be disconnected from z (DC)?
This is possible if x is completely outside the overlap of y and z. Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. If the part of y that overlaps with z does not include any part of x, then x and z would be disconnected.

Case 3: Can x partially overlap with z (PO)?
This is possible if x is partly within the overlap of y and z and partly outside it. Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. If the overlap of y and z includes part of x but not all of it, then x would partially overlap with z.

Case 4: Can x be externally connected to z (EC)?
For this to be true, x would need to touch the boundary of z at some point while being completely within y. But since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch the boundary of y. The boundary of z would need to cut through the interior of y for x to touch it. This is possible if the boundary of z passes through y and touches x but doesn't include any interior points of x.

Let's think more carefully about case 4 (EC): For x to be externally connected to z, they must touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, x is completely contained within the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For x to touch the boundary of z, the boundary of z would have to pass through the interior of y and touch x. This is indeed possible in a situation where z and y partially overlap, and the boundary of z inside y touches x.

Now let's also think about whether the remaining relations are possible:

Case 5: Can z be a proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi)?
For this to be true, z would need to be completely within x. But we know PO(y,z), which means that part of z is outside y. Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y. Therefore, z cannot be completely within x, so TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

Case 6: Can x be equal to z (EQ)?
For this to be true, x and z would have to be exactly the same region. But we know NTPP(x,y), which means x is a proper part of y. And we know PO(y,z), which means that z is partly outside y. Therefore, x and z cannot be the same region, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z
- EC(x,z): x is externally connected to z
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, let me review the logic for EC(x,z) once more. For x to be externally connected to z, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points. Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely contained within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary. For x to touch the boundary of z, the boundary of z would have to pass through the interior of y and touch the boundary of x.

This is possible in a setting where:
1. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap
3. The boundary of z passes through the interior of y in such a way that it touches the boundary of x but doesn't include any interior points of x.

I believe EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Let me review the other cases again to be sure:

DC(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely outside the overlap of y and z. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that the overlap does not include x.

PO(x,z): This is possible if x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that x and z share some interior points but x is not completely contained in z.

TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that x is completely contained in the overlap and touches the boundary of z.

NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Finally, let me check if TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are indeed impossible:

TPPi(x,z) (i.e., TPP(z,x)): This would mean that z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. But since PO(y,z), part of z is outside y. Since NTPP(x,y), all of x is inside y. Therefore, z cannot be a proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) (i.e., NTPP(z,x)): This would mean that z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But since PO(y,z), part of z is outside y. Since NTPP(x,y), all of x is inside y. Therefore, z cannot be a proper part of x, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are the same region. But since NTPP(x,y), all of x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Since PO(y,z), part of z is outside y. Therefore, x and z cannot be the same region, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z
- EC(x,z): x is externally connected to z
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, I'm still not completely confident about EC(x,z). Let me think about it once more.

EC(x,z) would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. 

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some points, but neither is contained in the other)

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at their boundaries but share no interior points. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, x is completely contained within the interior of y. 

For x to touch the boundary of z, the boundary of z would have to pass through the interior of y and exactly touch the boundary of x without including any interior points of x.

This is a very specific scenario, where:
1. The boundary of z cuts through the interior of y
2. This boundary of z exactly touches the boundary of x
3. No interior points of x are inside z

Actually, I'm realizing this can't happen. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, x is completely contained within the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If the boundary of z passes through the interior of y and touches the boundary of x, then either:
- x and z would share some interior points (making PO(x,z) true), or
- z would contain x (making TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) true)

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at their boundaries but share no interior points. But if x is completely within the interior of y, and the boundary of z passes through y, then it can't be the case that x and z touch only at their boundaries without sharing interior points.

So I believe EC(x,z) is actually not a valid possibility.

Let me review the possibilities again:

DC(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely outside the overlap of y and z. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that the overlap does not include x.

PO(x,z): This is possible if x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that x and z share some interior points but x is not completely contained in z.

TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that x is completely contained in the overlap and touches the boundary of z.

NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let me reconsider EC(x,z) with a concrete example. Let's say we have a small circle x, a larger circle y that completely contains x (with some space between their boundaries), and a third shape z that partially overlaps with y. If z is shaped such that its boundary passes through y and exactly touches the boundary of x without including any interior points of x, then EC(x,z) would be true. I don't think this is possible actually. With the constraint that NTPP(x,y), the boundary of x is entirely inside of interior(y). So the boundary of z must go inside of the interior of y. Let's say a point p is on boundaries of both x and z. So it is on boundary(x) and boundary(z). Since NTPP(x,y), p must be in interior(y). Since PO(y,z), z overlaps with y, meaning they share some interior points. The boundary of z divides the space into interior(z) and exterior(z). If the boundary of z passes through the interior of y, then on one side of boundary(z) we have interior(z) and on the other side we have exterior(z). But since PO(y,z), at least some of the interior of y is also interior of z. And, crucially, the portion of the interior of y very close to boundary(x) must also be in the interior of z (on the interior(z) side of boundary(z)). But this means that the interior of x is also in the interior of z, at least near point p. But that would mean x and z share interior points, which contradicts EC(x,z).

OK, EC(x,z) is actually impossible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Wait, let me reconsider TPP(x,z). TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since NTPP(x,y), x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely contained within the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For x to touch the boundary of z, the boundary of z would have to pass through the interior of y and touch the boundary of x. But if x is a proper part of z, then all of x is inside z. So if the boundary of z touches the boundary of x, then z would include some points outside of x and all points inside x. But this would make x a proper part of z, and x would touch the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Let me check once more with a real-world analogy. Let's say:
- x is a small city
- y is a state that completely contains the city (with some space between the city and the state border)
- z is a region that partially overlaps with the state

The relationship between x and z could be:
- DC(x,z): The city (x) does not overlap with the region (z) at all
- PO(x,z): The city (x) partially overlaps with the region (z)
- TPP(x,z): The city (x) is completely contained within the region (z) and touches the border of the region
- NTPP(x,z): The city (x) is completely contained within the region (z) and doesn't touch the border of the region

But the city (x) cannot:
- Be equal to the region (z), since the region partially extends outside the state (EQ)
- Contain the region (z), since the region extends outside the state (TPPi, NTPPi)
- Touch the region (z) only at the border, since the city is completely within the interior of the state (EC)

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Therefore, my answer is DC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what possible spatial relationships can exist between x and z, given that NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is completely contained within y
- x does not touch y's boundary

PO(y,z) means:
- y and z partially overlap
- They share some interior points
- Neither is contained within the other

Given these conditions, I'll analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since x is completely in the interior of y (doesn't touch y's boundary), and z only partially overlaps with y, x and z cannot be only externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x partially extends into the overlapping region of y and z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. If x is completely within z and touches z's boundary (which cuts through y's interior).

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. If x is completely contained within the part of z that overlaps with y, away from z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. Since part of z is outside y, and x is completely inside y, z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since z extends outside y, and x is completely inside y.
