PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the given facts:
1. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's think through this carefully.

Given that PO(x,y), x and y share a spatial part. This means that some of x is inside y, and some of x is outside y. 

Given that NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means that y is surrounded by z, with a gap between y and z's boundary.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

We know that a part of x is inside y (because of PO(x,y)), and y is completely inside z (because of NTPP(y,z)). This means that a part of x is also inside z, but we need to determine what happens with the rest of x.

The part of x that is inside y is definitely inside z (due to NTPP(y,z)). But what about the part of x that is outside y? There are several possibilities:

1. All of x that is outside y is still inside z. In this case, x is completely inside z, which could lead to either TPP(x,z) (if x touches z's boundary) or NTPP(x,z) (if x doesn't touch z's boundary).

2. Some of x that is outside y is inside z, and some is outside z. In this case, x and z share a part (the part of x that's inside z), but there's also a part of x outside z, which means PO(x,z).

3. All of x that is outside y is also outside z. This means that x partly overlaps with z (the part of x that's inside y is also inside z), which is again PO(x,z).

Let's consider whether other relations between x and z are possible:

DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected, but we know at least a part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y), so DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but have no common interior. But we know a part of x overlaps with y, which is inside z, so x and z share an interior, making EC(x,z) impossible.

TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But we know y is inside z, and y shares a part with x that is outside y, so z can't be completely inside x. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For similar reasons to TPPi, this is not possible.

EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. But since y is inside z and not equal to z, and x partially overlaps with y, x and z can't be identical. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this a bit more. I need to check if TPP(x,z) is actually possible.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must touch z's boundary. Now, given NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), a part of x is inside y and a part is outside y.

For x to be tangential to z, it needs to touch z's boundary. The part of x inside y can't touch z's boundary (since y doesn't touch z's boundary due to NTPP(y,z)). So, the only way for x to touch z's boundary is if the part of x outside y extends all the way to z's boundary.

This is certainly possible. The part of x that's outside y could touch z's boundary while still being inside z. In this case, TPP(x,z) would be true.

So, I think the answer is: the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

Let me see if I can determine whether other relations between x and z are ruled out by the constraints on using diagrammatic reasoning:

1. Start with a circle for z.
2. Place a smaller circle entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This is y.
3. Now, place a circle for x such that it overlaps with y but neither contains the other.

Scenario 1: x is entirely inside z. If it touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z). If it doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

Scenario 2: Part of x is inside z (specifically, the part that overlaps with y), and part of x is outside z. In this case, PO(x,z).

So, the possible relationships are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

Let's double-check whether DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ relations between x and z are indeed impossible.

DC(x,z): For x and z to be disconnected, they would need to have no spatial overlap. But we know a part of x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x and z must have some overlap. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): For x and z to be externally connected, they would need to share a boundary but no interior. Again, since part of x is inside y, and y is inside z, x and z share an interior. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be inside x and touch x's boundary. But since y is inside z, and x partially overlaps with y, z must have parts outside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. Again, since y is inside z, and x partially overlaps with y, z must have parts outside x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they would need to have the same spatial extent. But since y is inside z, and x partially overlaps with y, x and z can't be identical. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

Let me think through this more carefully to make sure I'm right. 

Given PO(x,y), we know that x and y share a part, but neither is inside the other. This means:
- Some of x is inside y.
- Some of x is outside y.
- Some of y is inside x.
- Some of y is outside x.

Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means:
- All of y is inside z.
- There's a gap between y and z's boundary.

Now, let's deduce the relation between x and z:

1. Since some of x is inside y (due to PO(x,y)), and all of y is inside z (due to NTPP(y,z)), some of x is definitely inside z.

2. For the part of x that's outside y, there are three possibilities:
   a. All of it is inside z, and none of it touches z's boundary. In this case, x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, so NTPP(x,z).
   b. All of it is inside z, but some of it touches z's boundary. In this case, x is completely inside z and touches its boundary, so TPP(x,z).
   c. Some of it is outside z. In this case, x and z share a part but neither is inside the other, so PO(x,z).

So yes, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check that none of the other relations are possible:

DC(x,z): This would mean x and z don't share any parts. But since some of x is inside y, and all of y is inside z, some of x is inside z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. But again, since some of x is inside y, and all of y is inside z, x and z share interior points. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But since y is inside z, and y shares parts with x that are outside y, z can't be completely inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, z can't be inside x because y is inside z and shares parts with x that are outside y. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z have the same spatial extent. But since y is inside z, and x and y only partially overlap, x and z can't be identical. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me see if there's a cleaner restatement. We know that x partially overlaps with a region y that's strictly inside z, i.e., there's a "buffer" between y and z's boundary. There are portions of x that are inside y, and hence inside z. The portions of x that are outside y could either: 
a) continue to be entirely inside z without touching its boundary (giving NTPP(x,z))
b) continue to be entirely inside z but touch z's boundary (giving TPP(x,z))
c) exit z (giving PO(x,z))

So, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

Actually, I think I might have been a bit sloppy earlier. Let me triple-check against the definitions to make sure I'm getting this right:

- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means they share a part, but neither is inside the other.

Given NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
Given PO(x,y), x and y share a part, but neither is inside the other.

I know that some of x is inside y, and all of y is inside z. So, some of x is definitely inside z. But some of x is also outside y. This outside part could either be inside z (giving TPP or NTPP, depending on whether it touches z's boundary) or partially outside z (giving PO).

So, the possible relations for x and z are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

I just realized I made a slight error in my earlier reasoning: I was using "inside" to mean "interior", whereas in RCC-8 "inside" would be a proper part (either tangential or non-tangential). But the analysis still stands, and the conclusion is the same: the possible relations are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and PO(x,z).

Actually, I'll take another look at what I said to make sure I have it:

"Inside" in the context of RCC-8 typically refers to a proper part relationship (either tangential or non-tangential). So, NTPP(y,z) means y is completely a part of z's interior and doesn't touch z's boundary. PO(x,y) means x and y share a part, but neither is a proper part of the other.

Given NTPP(y,z), y is completely a proper part of z's interior. Given PO(x,y), some of x is a proper part of y and some is not. The part of x that's a proper part of y is also a proper part of z. For the part of x that's not a part of y, there are three possibilities:
1. It's outside of z, which would give PO(x,z).
2. It's inside z and touches z's boundary, which would give TPP(x,z).
3. It's inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, which would give NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

Actually, I realize I have been using "inside" and "outside" informally to refer to the interior and exterior of regions, which is not the formal terminology of RCC-8. Let me re-run the analysis using the formal terminology.

In RCC-8, we have the relations:
- Disconnected (DC): The regions have no parts in common.
- Externally Connected (EC): The regions touch at their boundaries but have no common interior.
- Partial Overlap (PO): The regions share some parts, but neither is a proper part of the other.
- Tangential Proper Part (TPP): Region x is a proper part of region y, and x's boundary touches y's boundary.
- Non-tangential Proper Part (NTPP): Region x is a proper part of region y, and x's boundary doesn't touch y's boundary.
- Equals (EQ): The regions are identical.

Given the above, let's re-analyze the scenario:

1. PO(x,y): x and y share some parts, but neither is a proper part of the other.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z, and y's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary.

Since PO(x,y), a region of x is within y. Since NTPP(y,z), all of y is a proper part of z, and there's a buffer between y's boundary and z's boundary. This means the portion of x that is within y is also a proper part of z. For the part of x that's not within y, there are three possibilities:
   a. It extends to or beyond z's boundary, making x not a proper part of z. In this case, PO(x,z).
   b. It's a proper part of z, and it touches z's boundary. In this case, TPP(x,z).
   c. It's a proper part of z, but it doesn't touch z's boundary. In this case, NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

Let's double-check that none of the other relations are possible:

DC(x,z): This would mean x and z have no parts in common. But since a part of x is within y, and y is a proper part of z, x and z must share a part. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries only. But again, a part of x is within y, and y is a proper part of z. So, x and z share an interior, making EC(x,z) impossible.

TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x, and z's boundary touches x's boundary. But since y is a proper part of z, and y overlaps with x, z can't be a proper part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x, and z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, since y is a proper part of z, and y overlaps with x, z can't be a proper part of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. But since y is a proper part of z, and x and y are in a partial overlap relationship, x and z can't be identical. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

I'll think of another way of reasoning: Given PO(x,y), (i) x&y have a common part, (ii) x has a part not in y, and (iii) y has a part not in x. Given NTPP(y,z), (iv) y is a proper part of z and there's a buffer between y's boundary and z's boundary.

From (i) and (iv), we know that x and z have a common part. So, the only possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

Using (ii) and (iii), and considering the constraints from (iv), let's determine which of these relations are truly possible:

For TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ to be true, x would need to contain y. But from (iii), we know y has a part not in x, so none of these relations are possible.

For TPP, NTPP, or PO to be true, the part of x not in y (from (ii)) would determine the exact relation:
- If this part extends beyond z's boundary, then PO(x,z) holds.
- If this part is within z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) holds.
- If this part is within z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

Let's test this with a concrete example to check that all 3 of TPP, NTPP, PO are actually possible.
1. Let's make a drawing on a 2D plane. We'll represent z as a large circle centered at the origin with radius 10.
2. We'll represent y as a smaller circle centered at the origin with radius 5. This satisfies NTPP(y,z) because y is inside z and there's a buffer of distance 5 between the boundaries of y and z.
3. Now, let's represent x. We know PO(x,y), meaning x and y share a part, but neither is inside the other.
For each potential relation for (x,z):
(a) To check if TPP(x,z) is possible, we can represent x as a shape that covers a part of y (e.g., a semicircle inside y) and extends outside of y, reaching but not crossing z's boundary.
(b) To check if NTPP(x,z) is possible, we can represent x as a shape that covers a part of y and extends outside of y, but still keeping a distance from z's boundary.
(c) To check if PO(x,z) is possible, we can represent x as a shape that covers a part of y and extends beyond z's boundary.

Let's draw these:

TPP(x,z) example: Let's represent x as a semicircle that includes the left half of y, and extends to the left, touching the boundary of z.
NTPP(x,z) example: Let's represent x as a semicircle that includes the left half of y, and extends to the left, but stopping before reaching the boundary of z.
PO(x,z) example: Let's represent x as a semicircle that includes the left half of y, and extends to the left, crossing the boundary of z.

All three of these are valid configurations, which satisfy the original constraints of PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and PO(x,z).

OK so our answer is TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), or PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z based on the given facts: PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let's understand what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Since PO(x,y), part of x is inside y. And since NTPP(y,z), all of y is inside z with a buffer between y's boundary and z's boundary. This means the part of x that overlaps with y is definitely inside z.

For the part of x that is outside y, there are three possibilities:
1. It remains completely inside z and touches z's boundary → TPP(x,z)
2. It remains completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary → NTPP(x,z)
3. Some of it extends outside z → PO(x,z)

The other relations are impossible:
- DC(x,z) is impossible because x and z must share the part where x overlaps with y.
- EC(x,z) is impossible because x and z share interior points, not just boundary points.
- TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because z cannot be contained in x given the constraints.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), PO(x,z)
