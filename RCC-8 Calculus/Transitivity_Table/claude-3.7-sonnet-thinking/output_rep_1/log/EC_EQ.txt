PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

To figure out the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$, I need to reason through the implications of the given relations:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they are the same region).

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical spatial regions, any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EC(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

To verify this:
- If x touches y's boundary without sharing interior (EC(x,y)), and
- If z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)),
- Then x must touch z's boundary without sharing interior (EC(x,z))

So the answer is: EC(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z given EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

When EQ(y,z) holds, it means y and z are identical spatial regions - they occupy exactly the same space. This means that any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Since EC(x,y) holds (meaning x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior points), and z is identical to y, then x must have the same relationship with z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
