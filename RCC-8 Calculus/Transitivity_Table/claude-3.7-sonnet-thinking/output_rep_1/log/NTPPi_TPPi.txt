PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's break this down by understanding what these relations mean:

- NTPPi(x,y) means the same as NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained entirely within x, and does not touch x's boundary.

- TPPi(y,z) means the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

So, if y is contained entirely within x, and z is contained within y and touches y's boundary, what can we infer about the relationship between x and z?

Given that z touches y's boundary and y is entirely within x (without touching x's boundary), we can conclude that z is also entirely within x. But what about z's relationship with x's boundary?

z touches y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary. This means z is within x, but whether z touches x's boundary depends on whether the part of y's boundary that z touches is close enough to x's boundary.

Let's think about this step by step:

1. y is entirely within x, not touching x's boundary (due to NTPPi(x,y) or NTPP(y,x)).
2. z is within y, touching y's boundary (due to TPPi(y,z) or TPP(z,y)).

Since z is within y and y is entirely within x, z must also be within x. But there are two possibilities:

a. If z touches a part of y's boundary that's away from x's boundary, then z would be entirely within x without touching x's boundary. This would make the relation between x and z as NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x).

b. If z touches a part of y's boundary that's close to x's boundary, and if this contact extends to x's boundary, then z would be within x and also touch x's boundary. This would make the relation between x and z as TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x).

However, since y doesn't touch x's boundary (due to NTPPi(x,y)), and z is contained within y, z can't reach x's boundary. So, the relation between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z) or equivalently NTPP(z,x).

Actually, to think about this with more clarity, I need to be careful about the boundaries:

1. NTPPi(x,y) or NTPP(y,x) tells us that y is completely inside x, and there's a "gap" between y's boundary and x's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z) or TPP(z,y) tells us that z is inside y, and z's boundary touches y's boundary at least at one point.

Given these, z is inside y, and y is inside x with a gap between their boundaries. Even if z touches y's boundary, it can't reach x's boundary because of the gap. So, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which means NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x).

I should just double-check this: if z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., TPP(z,y) or equivalently TPPi(y,z)), and y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(y,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,y)), then z must be a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z)).

This is right. If y doesn't touch the boundary of x (because it's NTPP), and z is inside y, then z can't touch the boundary of x either. So, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check another way.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, we need to find the possible relationships between x and z. Since z is a part of y (from TPPi(y,z)) and y is a part of x (from NTPPi(x,y)), we know that z is a part of x by the transitivity of the "part of" relation.

But we need to determine if z touches x's boundary or not.

From NTPPi(x,y), we know y does not touch x's boundary, so there's a gap between y's boundary and x's boundary. Given TPPi(y,z), z touches y's boundary. But since y's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary, z can't touch x's boundary either.

Therefore, z is a part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So I believe the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I need to think about this more. I may have made a mistake.

1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
2. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

Now, the question is: If y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, and z is inside y touching y's boundary, what's the relationship between x and z?

z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z is inside x. But does z touch x's boundary?

Given that y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, z can't touch x's boundary.

So the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), or equivalently, NTPP(z,x).

Hmm, but let's think about this one more time to be sure: NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely inside x, away from x's boundary. TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Since z is inside y and y is entirely inside x, z is also entirely inside x. z touches y's boundary, but y's boundary is away from x's boundary, so z doesn't touch x's boundary.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I've been reasoning in circles. Let me be absolutely clear:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x) which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y) which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

If y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary, then z is inside x. But z, being inside y, cannot reach x's boundary. Therefore, z is strictly inside x without touching its boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me try to visualize this to make sure:

Imagine x as a big circle, and y as a smaller circle inside x, not touching the boundary of x. Now, z is an even smaller circle inside y, but touching the boundary of y. Since y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z, which is inside y, can't touch the boundary of x either.

So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I just realized I may have been mixing up the orders. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x). TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). So to make sure about the original question again:

NTPPi(x, y) means NTPP(y, x), which means y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary.
TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), which means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So, if y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary, then the relationship between x and z can be determined as:

1. z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z is inside x.
2. z touches y's boundary, but y's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary, so z doesn't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z, x) or NTPPi(x, z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think one more time.

Remember that NTPPi(x,y) means y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary. This means there is some distance (or gap) between the boundary of y and the boundary of x. Now, z is inside y and touches y's boundary. Even if z touches y's boundary at a point, because there's a gap between y's boundary and x's boundary, z won't touch x's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

But if this is true for all cases of z, then it's also possible for z to be a more specific subset of y such that z is much smaller and might not touch any boundary at all, making the relation NTPP(z,x). But the problem states TPPi(y,z), so z has to be touching the boundary of y, which we've established wouldn't result in z touching the boundary of x. So, the only relation is NTPPi(x,z), not both NTPPi(x,z) and NTPP(z,x).

Actually I'm confusing myself again because I was getting the i-versions mixed up in the above reasoning.

One more time, with extreme clarity, with the definitions straight:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
This means y is inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.
This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So:
1. y is inside x, away from x's boundary.
2. z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Therefore:
3. z is inside x.
4. z touches y's boundary, but y's boundary is away from x's boundary, so z does not touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x).

Wait, no. I'm making a mistake again.

The question asks for the relationship between x and z, and I gave NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is correct, but when we say "relationship between x and z," we can also express it as NTPPi(x,z), which means the same thing.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

This is the correct and final answer.

Actually, let's revisit the original definitions to make sure:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y): Same as TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y): Same as NTPP(y,x).
EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

My reasoning above is correct. If NTPPi(x,y), then y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). If TPPi(y,z), then z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., z is inside y and touches y's boundary).

Given these, z must be inside x but can't touch x's boundary (since it's inside y and y doesn't touch x's boundary). So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means NTPP(z,x) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the final answer is:

z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Hm, let me just double check that my reasoning is correct above. Actually, I should reason more carefully. Let me try again, visualizing a concrete example.

First, let's replace the RCC-8 relation symbols with their meanings to avoid confusion:

NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and does not touch x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Visualize this:
- x is a large square.
- y is a circle completely inside the square, not touching its edges (due to NTPPi(x,y)).
- z is a smaller circle inside y, but touching the boundary of y (due to TPPi(y,z)).

Now, what's the relationship between x (the large square) and z (the smallest circle)?

Since z is inside y and y is completely inside x, z is also completely inside x. The question is whether z touches the boundary of x.

Given that z touches the boundary of y and y does not touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x because there's a gap between the boundary of y (which z touches) and the boundary of x.

So, z is completely inside x and does not touch the boundary of x.

This means z is inside x and does not touch x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

(I think part of the confusion in my earlier reasoning was mixing up the order of the arguments and the direction of the relations, but I'm confident in the above reasoning.)

So, the final answer is:
The relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, now I'm realizing I forgot the original question. The question is asking for the possible relationships between x and z. I need to check if there are any other possible relationships besides NTPPi(x,z).

Given the constraints NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), is NTPPi(x,z) the only valid relation from the set of RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ)?

I've established that z is inside x and does not touch x's boundary. This is precisely the definition of NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z). None of the other relations from the set describe this configuration.

Just to be REALLY sure, let's go through all the possible RCC-8 relations and check if they might apply:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This can't be true because z is inside x (through y).
EC(x,z): x and z touch only at a boundary. This can't be true because z is inside x and can't touch its boundary.
PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This can't be true because z is completely inside x.
TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This can't be true because x is bigger than z (x contains y, which contains z).
NTPP(x,z): x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This can't be true for the same reason as above.
TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This can't be true because z is inside y, and y is away from x's boundary.
NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is true given the constraints.
EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This can't be true because x, y, and z are all distinct shapes with proper part relationships (i.e., NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) both imply proper part relationships, not equivalence).

So, the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints is NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the answer to the question "If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is: NTPPi(x,z).

Now I think I'm overthinking a bit, but let me just really make sure of the definitions one more time.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is inside x and away from x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means z is inside x and away from x's boundary.

Given the first two relations, z is inside y (touching its boundary) and y is inside x (away from its boundary). Therefore, z must be inside x, and it's away from x's boundary.

This agrees with NTPPi(x,z).

So, my answer is consistent: 
Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

WAIT, let me think one more time.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is entirely within y and touches y's boundary.

Is it really the case that z can't touch the boundary of x?

Let me try a different argument. Suppose z touches the boundary of y at some point p. Could p also be a point on the boundary of x? No, because y is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So p is on the boundary of y but not on the boundary of x. This means z touches the boundary of y but not the boundary of x.

So, z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, I've established multiple times and in different ways that the relationship between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) is NTPPi(x,z).

I'd like to be really sure this time I'm not making a mistake. Let me visualize this very concretely.

Imagine three concentric circles: x (biggest), y (middle), and z (smallest).
- Given NTPPi(x,y), y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- Given TPPi(y,z), z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, is there any way for z to touch x's boundary? No, because z is inside y and can only go as far as y's boundary. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, z can't touch x's boundary either.

Therefore, z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realized that in the world of RCC-8, shapes are more general than just concentric circles. Let's consider a general example:

Imagine a hollow square (let's call it x) and a solid circle inside the square (let's call it y). The circle doesn't touch the square's edges (due to NTPPi(x,y)).
Now, inside the circle, there's a third shape (let's call it z), which touches the boundary of the circle from the inside (due to TPPi(y,z)).

Does z touch the boundary of the square? No, because it's inside the circle, and the circle itself doesn't touch the square's edges.

So, z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

I think my answer is consistent and correct: The relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let me go one step at a time, and I apologize for the confusion earlier.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): This means y is strictly inside x, not touching the boundary of x.
2. TPPi(y,z): This means z is strictly inside y, touching the boundary of y.

We want to find the relation between x and z.

Let's consider a specific visualization:
- x is a large square.
- y is a circle inside x, not touching the square's edges (due to NTPPi(x,y)).
- z is a smaller shape inside y, touching the circle's boundary from inside (due to TPPi(y,z)).

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

Clearly, z is inside x. But does z touch the boundary of x? z touches the boundary of y, but since y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), z can't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me ensure there's no mistake this time.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Is z inside x? Yes, since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x (by transitivity).
Does z touch x's boundary? No, because while z touches y's boundary, y itself doesn't touch x's boundary. So, z can't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

(Just a note: while reasoning, I kept mixing the order of the arguments and the direction of the relations, which caused some confusion. Let me always be explicit about what a relation means rather than just relying on the symbol.)

Alright, I've consistently arrived at the same conclusion: The relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I just realized there's a potential edge case I hadn't considered:

What if y's boundary is complex, like a dough-nut shape, and there are parts of it that are "inside" (i.e, part of the interior of y), such as the hole of the dough-nut? If z touches this "inside" part of y's boundary, could z then also touch the boundary of x?

No, because the "inside" part of y's boundary is still part of y, and all of y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), according to NTPPi(x,y). So, even if z touches an "inside" part of y's boundary, z still can't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is still NTPPi(x,z).

Let's make sure there are no other edge cases I can think of.

Actually, wait a minute. Let's clarify something. In RCC-8, "NTPP(x,y)" means "x" is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of "y". This means the whole of x is contained within the interior of y; x does not share even a point with the boundary of y.

So, NTPP(y,x) (which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,y)) means y is contained entirely within the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x.

Similarly, TPP(z,y) (which is equivalent to TPPi(y,z)) means z is contained entirely within y, and z touches the boundary of y at least at one point.

Given these, if y is inside x but not touching x's boundary, and z is inside y and touching y's boundary, then z is inside x and not touching x's boundary. Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, let's clarify the notation. Maybe I've been inconsistent.

NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), so NTPPi(x,y) = NTPP(y,x).

If NTPP(y,x), this means:
- y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- y is fully contained within the interior of x (no part of y touches the boundary of x).

Similarly, TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), so TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y).

If TPP(z,y), this means:
- z is a tangential proper part of y.
- z is fully contained in y, and z touches the boundary of y at some point.

So, if y is fully inside x (not touching x's boundary) and z is fully inside y (touching y's boundary), then z must be fully inside x and can't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm I'm overelaborating, and I think I'm done. Let me write it succinctly:

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):
- y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z is inside y, touching y's boundary.

Therefore:
- z is inside x.
- z can't touch x's boundary because it's inside y, and y doesn't touch x's boundary.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, NTPP(z,x)).

ANSWER:

Looking at the given relations:

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

To determine the relationship between x and z, I need to analyze their spatial arrangement:

1. Since z is inside y (from TPPi(y,z)), and y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), by transitivity, z must be inside x.

2. Does z touch the boundary of x? No, it cannot. While z touches y's boundary, y itself doesn't touch x's boundary (by definition of NTPPi). Since y is completely contained within x with a gap between their boundaries, z cannot reach x's boundary.

Therefore, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which makes z a non-tangential proper part of x.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
