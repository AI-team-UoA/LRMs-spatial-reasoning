PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this. 

We're given that:
1. TPPi(x,y) 
2. EC(y,z)

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is a part of x and touches x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts.

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since y is a tangential proper part of x, this means that y is contained within x but touches the boundary of x. Since z is externally connected to y, they touch at their boundaries. 

There are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. z could be disconnected from x (DC). This would be possible if z touches y at a boundary that is not also a boundary of x.

2. z could be externally connected to x (EC). This would happen if z touches y at a boundary that is also a boundary of x.

3. z could partially overlap with x (PO). This would happen if z shares some part with x, but neither is a part of the other.

4. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPP). This would happen if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

Let me make sure I haven't missed any possibilities:

z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP) because z is externally connected to y, which means z touches the boundary of y. Since y is a tangential proper part of x, y touches the boundary of x. If z were a non-tangential proper part of x, it wouldn't touch the boundary of x, which would make it difficult for z to be externally connected to y (since y touches the boundary of x).

z cannot be a proper part with x as its part (TPPi or NTPPi) because that would mean x is contained within z, but we know y is contained within x, so y would also be contained within z. But this contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected.

z cannot be equal to x (EQ) because y is a tangential proper part of x, but y is externally connected to z, which means y and z don't share any interior parts. This would be a contradiction if z were equal to x, because then y would be a part of z and they would share interior parts.

So, my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, or TPP.

Hmm, wait. Let me double check by trying to visualize these situations.

TPPi(x, y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is completely contained within x but touches the boundary of x.

EC(y, z) means y and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

DC(x, z) would mean x and z are disconnected. Is this possible given the first two constraints? If y is completely contained within x and y touches z, then x and z would have to at least touch, so they can't be disconnected. So DC is not a valid option.

EC(x, z) would mean x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if y touches the boundary of x at the same place where y touches z. So EC is a valid option.

PO(x, z) would mean x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z extends into x (through the boundary that y touches) but also extends outside of x. So PO is a valid option.

TPP(z, x) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely contained within x but touches the boundary of x. This is possible if z is within x and touches the boundary of x at the same place where y touches the boundary of x. So TPP is a valid option.

NTPP(z, x) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Is this possible? If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, but z touches y, and y touches the boundary of x, then z would be somewhere in the interior of x. This doesn't seem to contradict our constraints, so NTPP is a valid option.

TPPi(x, z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely contained within z but touches the boundary of z. Is this possible? If x is completely within z, then y is also completely within z (since y is a part of x). But this contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected (which means they don't share any interior parts). So TPPi is not a valid option.

NTPPi(x, z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is even less possible than TPPi for the same reason. So NTPPi is not a valid option.

EQ(x, z) would mean x and z are equal. Is this possible? If x and z are the same, then y would be a tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected. So EQ is not a valid option.

So, revising my answer, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

Actually, I realize now that I need to be a bit more careful about the possibilities. Let's reason again.

TPPi(x, y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x.

So x "properly" contains y, and y touches the boundary of x. In other words, y is a proper sub-part of x, and y shares a part of its boundary with x's boundary.

EC(y, z) means that y and z are externally connected.

So y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts.

Let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

DC(x, z) means x and z are disconnected. 
Is this possible? No, because y is part of x and y touches z, so x and z cannot be completely disconnected.

EC(x, z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts.
Is this possible? Yes, if z touches y at a point on the boundary of y which is also on the boundary of x. In this case, z would touch x at their boundaries.

PO(x, z) means x and z partially overlap.
Is this possible? Yes, if z extends beyond x, but also shares some part with x.

TPP(z, x) means z is a tangential proper part of x.
Is this possible? Yes, if z is completely contained within x but touches the boundary of x. This could happen if z touches y at a point on the boundary of y which is also on the boundary of x.

NTPP(z, x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
Is this possible? I'm going to reconsider this. If z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z must be within the interior of x. But if z touches y, and y touches the boundary of x, then z would have to extend to the boundary of x to touch y. So, it's not possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x. So, NTPP is not a valid option.

Actually, I made a mistake in my previous reasoning. Let me think more carefully. TPPi(x, y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. EC(y, z) means y and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries.

Now, z could touch y at a part of y's boundary that is not also a part of x's boundary. In this case, z could still be completely contained within x's interior, making it a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP). So, NTPP is a valid option.

TPPi(x, z) means x is a tangential proper part of z.
Is this possible? No, if x is contained within z, then y is also contained within z (since y is a part of x). But this contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected.

NTPPi(x, z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
Is this possible? No, for the same reason as TPPi.

EQ(x, z) means x and z are equal.
Is this possible? No, if x and z are the same, then y would be a tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

Actually, I think I should redo my analysis of NTPP(z, x).

NTPP(z, x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Is this possible? If z is completely contained within the interior of x, and doesn't touch the boundary of x, can it be externally connected to y (which is a tangential proper part of x)? 

Since y is a tangential proper part of x, y touches the boundary of x. If z is in the interior of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, it could still touch y at a part of y's boundary that is not also part of x's boundary. So, it seems like NTPP(z, x) is indeed a valid option.

Actually, I realize that I'm not being careful enough with the notion of "touching boundaries". Let's be more precise.

TPPi(x, y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means that y is completely contained within x, and y shares at least one point with the boundary of x.

EC(y, z) means that y and z are externally connected. This means that y and z share at least one point, but their interiors do not intersect.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

DC(x, z) means x and z are disconnected, i.e., they don't share any points.
This is not possible because y (which is part of x) shares at least one point with z, so x and z must also share at least that point.

EC(x, z) means x and z are externally connected, i.e., they share at least one point, but their interiors do not intersect.
This is possible. For instance, if z only touches y at a point where y also touches the boundary of x, then z would be externally connected to x.

PO(x, z) means x and z partially overlap, i.e., they share some part, but neither is contained within the other.
This is possible. For instance, if z extends partly into x (through y) but also extends outside of x.

TPP(z, x) means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely contained within x and shares at least one point with the boundary of x.
This is possible. For instance, if z is completely contained within x and touches the boundary of x at a point where y also touches the boundary of x.

NTPP(z, x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely contained within x and does not share any points with the boundary of x.
This is possible. For instance, if z is completely contained within x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, but touches y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x.

TPPi(x, z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely contained within z and shares at least one point with the boundary of z.
This is not possible. If x is completely contained within z, then y (which is a proper part of x) would also be completely contained within z. But this contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected, which means their interiors do not intersect.

NTPPi(x, z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely contained within z and does not share any points with the boundary of z.
This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

EQ(x, z) means x and z are equal.
This is not possible. If x and z are equal, then y (which is a proper part of x) would also be a proper part of z. But this contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected, which means their interiors do not intersect.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

Okay, I think I'm finally getting somewhere. Let me try a few specific examples to check these possibilities.

1. EC(x, z): Let's imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle tangential to the boundary of x, and z as a third circle outside of x, but touching y at a point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of x. Then x and z would just touch at one point, making them externally connected.

2. PO(x, z): Let's imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle tangential to the boundary of x, and z as a circle that partially overlaps with y and x, extending both inside and outside of x. Then x and z would share a part, but neither would be a part of the other, making them partially overlapping.

3. TPP(z, x): Let's imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle tangential to the boundary of x, and z as a circle that is completely contained within x, but touches the boundary of x at a point. Also, z touches y at some point (which can be on the boundary of x or not). Then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

4. NTPP(z, x): Let's imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle tangential to the boundary of x, and z as a circle that is completely contained within x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, but touches y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x. Then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, all four of these relations seem to be possible. Let me check once more to make sure I haven't missed anything:

5. DC(x, z): This is not possible because y is a part of x and y touches z, so x and z cannot be completely disconnected.

6. TPPi(x, z): This is not possible because it would mean x is contained within z, which would mean y is also contained within z (since y is a part of x). But this contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x, z): This is not possible because it would mean y is a part of z, which contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected.

So, the final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

But actually, it seems like I made a confusion in my third example. Let me revisit TPP(z, x):

For TPP(z, x) to be true, z must be completely contained within x and must touch the boundary of x. Also, given that EC(y, z), z must touch y at their boundaries.

Given that TPPi(x, y), y is contained within x and touches the boundary of x. 

Now, if z is to be a tangential proper part of x, it must be completely contained within x and touch the boundary of x. But it must also touch y. Can all these constraints be met? Let's see:

z can be within x and touch the boundary of x. z can also touch y at their boundaries. But the question is: can z touch y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x? If yes, then TPP(z, x) is possible. If not, then TPP(z, x) is not possible.

Given that y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x, y)), y can have parts of its boundary that are not on the boundary of x. So, z can touch y at such a part, while still being completely within x and touching the boundary of x at another point. So, TPP(z, x) is indeed possible.

Let's now revisit NTPP(z, x):

For NTPP(z, x) to be true, z must be completely contained within x and must not touch the boundary of x. Also, given that EC(y, z), z must touch y at their boundaries.

Given that TPPi(x, y), y is contained within x and touches the boundary of x. 

Now, if z is to be a non-tangential proper part of x, it must be completely contained within x and not touch the boundary of x. But it must also touch y. Can all these constraints be met? Let's see:

z can be within x and not touch the boundary of x. z can also touch y at their boundaries. But can z touch y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x? If yes, then NTPP(z, x) is possible. If not, then NTPP(z, x) is not possible.

As mentioned earlier, y can have parts of its boundary that are not on the boundary of x. So, z can touch y at such a part, while still being completely within x and not touching the boundary of x. So, NTPP(z, x) is also possible.

So, to sum up, the possible relations between x and z are: EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let's understand what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap)

Analyzing possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible because y is part of x and y touches z, so x and z must share at least that point.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible when z touches y at a point where y also touches the boundary of x, making x and z externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible when z partially extends into x (through its connection with y) but also extends outside of x.

4. TPP(z,x) - Possible when z is completely contained within x and touches the boundary of x at some point.

5. NTPP(z,x) - Possible when z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, but touches y at a point where y doesn't touch x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible because if x were contained in z, then y would also be contained in z, contradicting EC(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible because if x equals z, then y would be part of z, contradicting EC(y,z).
