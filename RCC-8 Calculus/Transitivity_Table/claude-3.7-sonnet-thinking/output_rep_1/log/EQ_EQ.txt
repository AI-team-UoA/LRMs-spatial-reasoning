PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem step by step. We are given that:
- EQ(x,y), meaning that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- EQ(y,z), meaning that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y occupy exactly the same space, and EQ(y,z) means that y and z occupy exactly the same space, it follows that x and z must also occupy exactly the same space. In other words, x and z must be coincident, which means EQ(x,z).

This is a straightforward application of the transitive property: if x equals y and y equals z, then x equals z.

So the answer is:

The only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relation holds between x and z given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (occupy exactly the same space), and EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, then by the transitive property of equality, x and z must also be coincident.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
