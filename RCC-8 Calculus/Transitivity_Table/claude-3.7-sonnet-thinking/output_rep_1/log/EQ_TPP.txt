PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

First, we have two given relations:
1. EQ(x,y) - x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region.
2. TPP(y,z) - y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given these constraints.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same region spatially. This means x inherits all of y's spatial relationships with other regions.

Given that TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z, and since x is equivalent to y (EQ(x,y)), then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z would be TPP(x,z).

Let me double check this by considering each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected. This can't be true because we know y is a part of z, and x is equivalent to y.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior. This can't be true because y is a part of z (shares interior), and x is equivalent to y.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap. This can't be true because y is completely contained within z, and x is equivalent to y.
4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z. This seems correct because y is a tangential proper part of z, and x is equivalent to y.
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This can't be true because y touches z's boundary (it's tangential), and x is equivalent to y.
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x. This can't be true because y is contained within z, not the other way around, and x is equivalent to y.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This can't be true for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident. This can't be true because y is a proper part of z, not equivalent to z, and x is equivalent to y.

After checking all possibilities, TPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, let me re-verify this more carefully. We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

If x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), then any spatial relation that holds between y and another region also holds between x and that region. Since TPP(y,z) holds, then TPP(x,z) must also hold.

So the answer is: TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relation must hold between x and z given the provided relations.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (occupy exactly the same space)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are effectively the same region spatially. This means x inherits all of y's spatial relationships with other regions.

Because y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x is identical to y, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
