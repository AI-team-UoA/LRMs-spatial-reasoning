PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

This question concerns what's called the "composition" of the EC relation with itself in the RCC-8 calculus. The composition is the set of possible relations that can hold between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). Let's analyze this systematically.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.

So, we have a scenario where:
- x touches y at their boundaries
- y touches z at their boundaries

Given this setup, what are the possible relations between x and z? Let's consider each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Is it possible that x and z are completely disconnected? Yes, this is definitely possible. Think of three regions where two pairs touch at their boundaries, but the third pair is completely separate.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Is it possible that x and z touch at their boundaries? Yes, this is possible. Think of three regions arranged in a line where the middle one (y) touches both the others, and the outer two also touch each other.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Is it possible that x and z partially overlap? Yes, this is possible. Imagine y as a thin strip that touches both x and z at their boundaries, but x and z themselves have substantial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z? Yes, this is possible. Imagine y as touching both x and z at their boundaries, where x is completely inside z except that x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z? No, this isn't possible. If x and y are externally connected (touch at boundaries), and z only touches y at boundaries, then x must either be disconnected from z or touch z at its boundary - it can't be completely contained within z without touching its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse: Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x? Yes, similar reasoning as for TPP.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse: Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x? No, similar reasoning as for NTPP.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: Is it possible that x and z are equal? Yes, this is possible. Imagine y as a region that touches the boundary of both x and z, and x and z are identical.

So the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, hold on. I'm a bit uncertain about my reasoning for EQ(x,z) above. Let me reconsider that one:

If x equals z, and y externally connects to both, then x (which is identical to z) would have to externally connect to y in two separate ways, which doesn't make sense in this context. EQ(x,z) means they occupy exactly the same space, but then they couldn't both be EC to y unless y had a very specific shape that allowed it to touch x=z in two separate boundary regions. While this might be possible in some abstract topological sense, in the standard RCC-8 interpretation this would likely be considered a single EC relationship, not two separate ones. So I think EQ(x,z) should not be included.

Actually, let me reconsider that. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and if x = z (i.e., EQ(x,z)), then we'd have EC(x,y) and EC(y,x), which means that x and y touch at their boundaries, which is consistent with the definition of EC. So EQ(x,z) is actually possible.

Actually, I need to be more careful here. In RCC-8, the relations are about regions in space, and the standard interpretation doesn't allow for regions to be "pinched" or have other unusual topological properties. In the typical interpretation:

If EC(x,y) - x and y touch at their boundaries
And EC(y,z) - y and z touch at their boundaries
And EQ(x,z) - x and z are identical

Then we'd effectively have EC(x,y) stated twice, which doesn't add any new information and doesn't represent two separate connections. So I think EQ(x,z) is possible.

Actually, wait. If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) and EQ(x,z), then we'd have y externally connected to both x and z, but x and z are the same region. This would mean y is externally connected to the same region twice, which doesn't make sense in the context of RCC-8 where each pair of regions has exactly one relation. So I don't think EQ(x,z) is possible.

Let me take a different approach to this. If x = z (i.e., EQ(x,z)), then we could substitute z with x in EC(y,z) to get EC(y,x). But EC is symmetric, so EC(y,x) is the same as EC(x,y). So we'd have EC(x,y) twice, which doesn't change anything. This means that the constraint "EC(x,y) and EC(y,z)" doesn't rule out the possibility that x = z. So EQ(x,z) is still a possible relation.

But let's think more concretely about what this would mean. If x = z, then the region y would have to touch the boundary of x at two different places or in two different ways. In the standard interpretation of RCC-8, this would still be considered a single EC relation, not two separate ones. But the question explicitly states that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are two separate constraints. This suggests that y is touching two different regions, not the same region twice. So in this context, I think EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me think about this from yet another angle. The question is asking about the composition of EC with EC. In RCC-8, compositions are typically computed based on the underlying topological properties. For the composition EC ◦ EC, if we were to allow EQ(x,z), it would mean that a region could externally connect to the same region in two different ways, which would violate the basic premises of the calculus.

But I think I'm overthinking this. In mathematical terms, if we have EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and if x = z (i.e., EQ(x,z)), then we'd have EC(x,y) and EC(y,x) (by substitution). But EC is symmetric, so EC(y,x) is the same as EC(x,y). So we'd effectively have EC(x,y) stated twice, which doesn't add any new information and doesn't represent two separate connections. This doesn't seem to introduce any contradiction, so EQ(x,z) should be a possible relation.

Actually, I'm going to rely on my knowledge of the standard RCC-8 composition table. If I recall correctly, the composition EC ◦ EC results in {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}, which is the universal relation (all relations are possible). But I might be misremembering, and it's better to reason through it carefully.

Let me try one more approach. In the context of RCC-8, regions are typically considered to be normal topological regions (regular closed sets), and the relations are based on topological properties. Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), let's visualize different scenarios:

For DC(x,z): Imagine y as a thin strip between x and z, where y touches both but x and z are separated.
For EC(x,z): Imagine three regions in a triangular arrangement, all touching at the boundaries.
For PO(x,z): Imagine y as a thin strip that touches the boundaries of both x and z, but x and z have substantial overlap.
For TPP(x,z): Imagine y touching the boundary of x, which is mostly inside z and touches z's boundary.
For NTPP(x,z): This doesn't seem possible because if x is completely inside z (without touching its boundary), how could it externally connect to y, which also externally connects to z?
For TPPi(x,z): Similar to TPP, but with the roles of x and z reversed.
For NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, this doesn't seem possible.
For EQ(x,z): This would mean y externally connects to the same region from two different "directions," which is possible in a general topological sense.

So, based on this visualization, the possible relations are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

I'm still uncertain about NTPP and NTPPi, but my intuition is that they're not possible. Let me reason again about NTPP(x,z).

If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y touches the boundary of x. But since EC(y,z), y also touches the boundary of z. This creates a contradiction: if y touches the boundary of x, and x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y would have to penetrate z's boundary to touch x, which would make y partially inside z. But then y and z wouldn't be externally connected (they'd partially overlap). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similar reasoning applies to NTPPi(x,z), making it not possible either.

Let me reason again about EQ(x,z). If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y would be externally connected to the same region from two different "directions" or at two different boundary points. This is possible in a topological sense, so EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

Actually, I want to reconsider my reasoning. If x and z are the same region (EQ(x,z)), and if EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), then y would be externally connected to the same region (x, which is the same as z). But in the context of RCC-8, which is about the relation between pairs of regions, this would simply be stated as EC(x,y) or EC(y,z) (since x and z are the same), not both. The fact that the problem statement gives both EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) as separate constraints suggests that x and z are distinct regions. So, in the context of this problem, I now think EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Alright, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's take a step back.

In the RCC-8 calculus, we're reasoning about regions and their topological relationships. If regions x and z are identical (EQ(x,z)), then any relation involving one can be substituted with the other. So, EC(y,z) would be equivalent to EC(y,x). But EC is symmetric, so EC(y,x) is the same as EC(x,y). This means we'd have EC(x,y) stated twice, which doesn't add any new information. But the problem statement presents EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) as distinct constraints, which implies that x and z are not the same region. In the context of this problem, I believe EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

For clarity, let's go through all the possible RCC-8 relations:

DC(x,z) - disconnected: Possible. Imagine y as a bridge connecting x and z, but x and z are separate.
EC(x,z) - externally connected: Possible. Imagine three regions in a triangular arrangement, all touching at boundaries.
PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Possible. Imagine y as a thin strip touching the boundaries of x and z, but x and z have substantial overlap.
TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: Possible. Imagine y touching the boundary of x, which is mostly inside z and touches z's boundary.
NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: Not possible. If x is inside z without touching its boundary, and y connects to x at its boundary, then y would penetrate z's boundary, making y and z not externally connected.
TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse: Possible. Similar to TPP but with roles reversed.
NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse: Not possible. Similar reasoning as for NTPP.
EQ(x,z) - equal: Not possible based on the context of the problem, as explained above.

So, the possible relations are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Hmm, I'm still uncertain about EQ(x,z). Let me double-check if it's possible by considering a specific example.

Imagine a scenario where:
- x is a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 1.
- z is also a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 1. (So x and z are identical, i.e., EQ(x,z))
- y is a circle centered at (2, 0) with radius 1.

In this scenario, y touches the boundary of x at the point (1, 0), so EC(x,y). Similarly, y touches the boundary of z at the same point, so EC(y,z). This scenario satisfies the constraints EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), and also has EQ(x,z).

So, EQ(x,z) is indeed a possible relation given the constraints.

Let me do a final cross-check:
- DC(x,z): Possible. As visualized before.
- EC(x,z): Possible. As visualized before.
- PO(x,z): Possible. As visualized before.
- TPP(x,z): Possible. As visualized before.
- NTPP(x,z): Still seems not possible based on the reasoning above.
- TPPi(x,z): Possible. As reasoned before.
- NTPPi(x,z): Still seems not possible based on the reasoning above.
- EQ(x,z): Possible. As shown in the specific example.

So, the possible relations are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, I'm still not convinced about NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider with clearer reasoning.

For NTPP(x,z): If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Since EC(x,y), y touches the boundary of x. And since EC(y,z), y touches the boundary of z. But for y to touch the boundary of x, it would have to at least extend to the boundary of x. And for y to touch the boundary of z, it would have to at least extend to the boundary of z. But if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, there's a gap between the boundary of x and the boundary of z. For y to touch both boundaries, it would have to bridge this gap, which would mean y has parts that are inside z. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z only touch at their boundaries. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similar reasoning applies, where z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This would also lead to a contradiction with the given constraints.

So, after this more detailed reasoning, the possible relations are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, I want to consult standard sources. Looking at typical RCC-8 composition tables, the composition of EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) would result in the relation between x and z. Without access to that composition table though, I'll reason through all possible configurations based on what I know about RCC-8.

I've thought about it from multiple angles, and I believe my reasoning is correct. The RCC-8 relations are based on topological properties, and the composition of relations must respect these properties. Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z) - disconnected
- EC(x,z) - externally connected
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part
- TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse
- EQ(x,z) - equal

Hmm, but I'm still not fully convinced about EQ(x,z).

Let's reconsider the example I gave earlier: 
- x is a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 1.
- z is also a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 1. (So x and z are identical, i.e., EQ(x,z))
- y is a circle centered at (2, 0) with radius 1.

In this scenario, y touches the boundary of x at the point (1, 0), so EC(x,y). Similarly, y touches the boundary of z at the same point, so EC(y,z). And x and z are identical, so EQ(x,z).

But here's the catch: the constraints EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) in this scenario are not capturing any additional information about the relationship between x, y, and z beyond what's already captured by EC(x,y) (since x and z are the same). In the context of RCC-8, the relation between a pair of regions is unique. If x and z are the same, then the relation between x and y is the same as the relation between z and y.

But the way the problem is formulated, it's asking about the relationship between two distinct variables x and z, given their relationships with a third variable y. I think EQ(x,z) is a valid answer, because there's nothing in the constraints that prevents x and z from being the same region.

So, my final answer is:
- DC(x,z) - disconnected
- EC(x,z) - externally connected
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part
- TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse
- EQ(x,z) - equal

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to consider how regions can be arranged when they externally connect (touch at boundaries but don't overlap).

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

Let me analyze the possibilities for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x and z can be completely disconnected, with y touching both at different boundary points.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x and z can touch at their boundaries, forming a triangle-like arrangement with y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap, with y touching both at their boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a tangential proper part of z (inside z but touching z's boundary), with y touching both at their boundaries.

5. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a tangential proper part of x, with y touching both at their boundaries.

6. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be identical, with y touching their common boundary.

7. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y cannot touch both x's boundary and z's boundary while remaining externally connected to z.

8. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - Similar to NTPP, but with roles reversed.
