PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the situation:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x) which means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

So we know:
- y is properly inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Now let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Can x be disconnected from z (DC)? 
If x and z are disconnected, then y cannot be part of both x and z. Since we know y is part of both, x cannot be disconnected from z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. Can x be externally connected to z (EC)?
If x and z only touch at their boundaries, then their interiors are disjoint. But y is in the interior of x and also in z. So y would have to be at the boundary of z. But we're told that y touches z's boundary, not that y is on the boundary of z. So EC(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. The fact that TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary. It doesn't mean y is entirely on z's boundary - in fact, that would contradict y being a proper part of z. So y has some parts in the interior of z and some parts touching z's boundary.

Since y is completely in the interior of x (not touching x's boundary), and y touches z's boundary, there must be some overlap between the interior of x and the boundary of z. This means x and z cannot be externally connected - they must have overlapping interiors. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. Can x partially overlap z (PO)?
If x and z partially overlap, then some part of x is in z and some part of x is outside z, and vice versa. We know that y is completely inside x and also inside z. So at minimum, the part of x containing y overlaps with z. It's possible that x extends beyond z in some areas, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)?
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. We know y is inside x and y touches z's boundary. This means x must also touch z's boundary at least where y does. And since x is larger than y (y is a proper part of x), it's possible for all of x to be within z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)?
If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y being inside x would also be completely inside z and not touching z's boundary. But we know TPP(y,z), meaning y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)?
If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. We know y is inside z and also properly inside x (not touching x's boundary). If z touches x's boundary, then z extends to parts of x that y doesn't reach. This seems consistent with our constraints, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)?
If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then everything inside z (including y) would also not touch x's boundary. This is consistent with y being properly inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. Can x and z be equal (EQ)?
If x and z are identical, then y would have the same relationship to both. But y has different relationships with x and z: y is properly inside x (not touching its boundary) but y is tangentially inside z (touching its boundary). So x and z cannot be equal. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check these conclusions:

- DC(x,z): Not possible because y is part of both x and z.
- EC(x,z): Not possible because y is interior to x but touches z's boundary.
- PO(x,z): Possible. x and z overlap at least where y is, and x could extend beyond z.
- TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary at least where y touches it.
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible because y (inside x) touches z's boundary, so x must also touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary while y is strictly interior to x.
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because y has different relationships with x and z.

Hmm, let me think through this more carefully, especially about TPPi(x,z). If TPPi(x,z), then TPP(z,x), meaning z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know NTPPi(x,y), which means y is inside x and does NOT touch x's boundary. And we know TPP(y,z), meaning y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If z touches x's boundary and y touches z's boundary, would that mean y touches x's boundary? Not necessarily. y could touch z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is still possible.

But let me reason through this again. We know:
- y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary) - from NTPPi(x,y)
- y is inside z and touches z's boundary - from TPP(y,z)

Now, if TPPi(x,z), then:
- z is inside x and touches x's boundary

This means z extends to x's boundary in some places. Since y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, y must touch z's boundary at places where z doesn't touch x's boundary. This is geometrically possible. So TPPi(x,z) remains a possibility.

Let me continue rechecking:

For PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then some part of x is outside z. We know y is fully inside both x and z. It's possible that x extends beyond z in some areas, so PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, we need to check if this is consistent with our constraints. We know y is inside x and y touches z's boundary. This means x must also touch z's boundary at least where y does. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): If NTPPi(x,z), then NTPP(z,x), meaning z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But we know TPP(y,z), meaning y touches z's boundary. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then y can't touch x's boundary - which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

I'm having some doubts about my conclusion for PO(x,z). Let me think about it more:

With PO(x,z), some part of x is in z, and some part is outside z. Similarly, some part of z is in x, and some part is outside x. We know y is completely inside both x and z. 

If y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)), and y is completely inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), then there's a point on z's boundary that's inside x. This means z's boundary intersects with the interior of x.

In a partial overlap scenario (PO), the boundary of z would intersect both the interior and exterior of x. So it's geometrically possible for y to touch z's boundary at a point inside x. So PO(x,z) is still a possibility.

I believe my conclusions are correct. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let's re-think the problem more carefully, making use of a composition table for RCC-8, which tells us the possible relations between x and z given relations between x and y and between y and z.

Looking at the composition:
NTPPi(x,y) ∘ TPP(y,z)

From the RCC-8 composition table, this gives:
PO(x,z) or TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) or EQ(x,z)

But I previously ruled out EQ(x,z) because if x and z were identical, then y would have to have the same relationship with both, which it doesn't.

So my final answer is:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me just double-check by considering the set-theoretic implications of these relations:

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be identical. But y is strictly inside x (not touching its boundary) while y touches z's boundary. These are contradictory if x and z are identical. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

For the other relations, let me verify again:

- PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. Since y is inside both x and z, they must overlap at least where y is. And since y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, z's boundary must intersect with the interior of x. This is consistent with a partial overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

- TPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is inside x and touches z's boundary, x must also touch z's boundary at least where y does. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

- TPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. We know y is inside z and inside x, not touching x's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, it means z extends to parts of x that y doesn't reach. This is consistent with our constraints. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z doesn't touch x's boundary and y is inside z, then y also doesn't touch x's boundary - which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Looking at the composition table for RCC-8:

For NTPPi(x,y) ∘ TPP(y,z), the result includes:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

But we've reasoned that EQ(x,z) is not possible given the specific constraints of this problem.

I'm now confident in my answer: The possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I'm now having some doubts about my analysis. Let me reconsider.

Actually, let's think about what these relations mean in terms of set-theoretic concepts:

- NTPPi(x,y): This is like y ⊂ x (y is a proper subset of x), and the boundary of y doesn't intersect the boundary of x. In other words, y is deep inside of x.
- TPP(y,z): This is like y ⊂ z (y is a proper subset of z), and the boundary of y intersects the boundary of z. In other words, y is inside of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, when we ask about the relation between x and z, we have:
- y is deep inside x
- y is inside z and touches z's boundary

Let's consider:

1. If y is inside both x and z, then x and z must overlap (this rules out DC and EC).
2. y touches z's boundary but y does not touch x's boundary.
3. y is a proper part of z. The boundary of y intersects the boundary of z.
4. y is a proper part of x. The boundary of y doesn't intersect the boundary of x.

EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are identical. But y has different relationships with x and z: y is deep inside x but touches z's boundary. This is a contradiction if x and z are identical. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) would mean x is deep inside z. But y, which is inside x, touches z's boundary. This would mean x also touches z's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z) would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is inside x and touches z's boundary, x must also touch z's boundary at least where y does. This is consistent with TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z) would mean x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible: y is inside both x and z, so they overlap at least where y is. And since y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, the boundary of z intersects the interior of x. This is consistent with a partial overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since y is inside z and deep inside x, z must extend to parts of x that y doesn't reach. This is geometrically possible. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is deep inside x. But if y touches z's boundary and y is inside x, then z's boundary is inside x. This is consistent with z being deep inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I'm making a mistake. I'm thinking that if y touches the boundary of z from inside, then anything containing y (like x in my TPPi and NTPPi analyses) must also contain that boundary point of z. But that's not right. If y touches the boundary of z from inside z, and y is contained in x, it doesn't mean z's boundary is inside x.

Let me reason about this more concretely:

Imagine a point p on the boundary of z that y touches. Since y is inside z, y contains this boundary point p (or at least touches it). Now, since y is deep inside x, everything in y, including this point p, is inside x. So p, which is on the boundary of z, is inside x. This means z's boundary intersects the interior of x.

This rules out TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), because in those cases, the boundary of z would be either touching the boundary of x or outside x.

Hmm, I still feel unsure though. Let's reason about TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) once more. 

If TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) were true, it would imply that z is contained within x. If y touches the boundary of z from inside, then y contains a point p on the boundary of z. Since y is inside x, this point p is also inside x. But if z is inside x, how can its boundary be inside x? This seems inconsistent.

Actually, it is consistent for certain spatial configurations.

Let's say we have a point p on the boundary of z.
- TPPi(x,z) would mean the boundary of z touches the boundary of x somewhere, but not necessarily at p.
- NTPPi(x,z) would mean no part of the boundary of z touches the boundary of x.

If y touches the boundary of z at point p, and y is inside x, then p is inside x. This means the boundary of z intersects the interior of x at p. For TPPi(x,z), this is possible if the boundary of z also touches the boundary of x at some other point (not p). For NTPPi(x,z), this would be a contradiction because the boundary of z shouldn't intersect the interior of x.

So, TPPi(x,z) might be possible, but NTPPi(x,z) is not.

Wait, I'm still not reasoning correctly. Let me re-read the definitions:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y's boundary does not touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y's boundary touches z's boundary.

So:
1. y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

Now, for TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x, touching x's boundary. If part of y is at the intersection of x and z, and y touches z's boundary, yet y doesn't touch x's boundary, then z's boundary and x's boundary are distinct at the point where y touches z's boundary. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, y (and consequently z) doesn't extend all the way to x's boundary. But TPPi(x,z) requires z to touch x's boundary, which y doesn't. This is a contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x, not touching x's boundary. This is consistent with y being inside both and touching z's boundary but not x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

That said, let me draw this out or think about it in another way:

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a small region completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a small region completely inside z, touching the boundary of z.

Now, for z to be completely inside x and not touching the boundary of x (i.e., NTPPi(x,z)), y would also be inside x, not touching the boundary of x, and if y touches the boundary of z, the boundary of z must be inside the interior of x. This is consistent. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For z to be completely inside x and touching the boundary of x (i.e., TPPi(x,z)), y would be inside x, not touching the boundary of x, and if y touches the boundary of z, and z touches the boundary of x, can y avoid touching the boundary of x? Yes, if y touches z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is also possible.

For x to partially overlap with z (i.e., PO(x,z)), some of x is inside z, and some is outside, and similarly, some of z is inside x, and some is outside. If y is inside both and touches the boundary of z but not the boundary of x, this is geometrically possible. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For x to be completely inside z and touching the boundary of z (i.e., TPP(x,z)), y would be inside x and hence inside z. If y touches the boundary of z, x could also touch the boundary of z at that point or elsewhere. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For x to be completely inside z and not touching the boundary of z (i.e., NTPP(x,z)), y would be inside x and hence inside z. But if y touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, then x must also touch the boundary of z, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, maybe I'm overthinking this.

Let's use the RCC8 composition table, which I believe says for NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:

PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)

However, I've been reasoning that EQ(x,z) is not possible based on the given constraints, which I still believe is the case.

I'm now starting to doubt my reasoning about NTPPi(x,z), because I keep going back and forth. Let me think one more time about the TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) cases:

For TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, touching the boundary of x. Given that y is inside z and touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x not touching the boundary of x, the boundary of z that y touches must be inside the interior of x. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must also touch the boundary of x somewhere else, away from where y is. This is geometrically possible. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, not touching the boundary of x. Given that y is inside z and touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x not touching the boundary of x, this boundary of z must be inside the interior of x. This is consistent with z being inside x and not touching the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

I now think my reasoning is clear, and the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I'm sorry for the confusion. Let me be very precise about the definitions and reasoning:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is wholly inside x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is wholly inside z and touches the boundary of z.

Let's reason for each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is inside both, they must overlap. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z only touch at their boundaries. But since y is inside both, they must overlap in their interiors. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. But y has different relationships with x and z: y doesn't touch x's boundary but does touch z's boundary. This is a contradiction if x and z are identical. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

4. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Given that y is inside both and has the described relationships, this is geometrically possible. So PO(x,z) is possible.

5. TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. Given that y is inside x and touches the boundary of z, x must also touch the boundary of z at least where y does. This is consistent. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

6. NTPP(x,z): This means x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. But if y is inside x and touches the boundary of z, then x must also touch the boundary of z via y. This contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But if y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and z touches the boundary of x, then z extends to parts of x that y doesn't reach. This is geometrically possible. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Given that y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of x, this is consistent. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me just recheck my reasoning for the main points of confusion, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):

For TPPi(x,z):
- z is inside x (so y, being inside z, is also inside x).
- z touches the boundary of x.
- y doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- y touches the boundary of z.

This means y touches the boundary of z at a point that's inside x, away from where z touches the boundary of x. This is geometrically possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- z is inside x (so y, being inside z, is also inside x).
- z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- y doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- y touches the boundary of z.

This means y touches the boundary of z at a point that's inside x, away from the boundary of x. This is geometrically consistent with z being inside x and not touching the boundary of x.

So, both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible, along with PO(x,z) and TPP(x,z).

I just had one more clarification to make regarding the distinction between being "at" a boundary and "touching" a boundary. In RCC8, touching a boundary means having a common point, not necessarily being contained in the boundary. So when we say "y touches the boundary of z," it doesn't mean y is part of the boundary, but rather that y and the boundary of z have a non-empty intersection. With that in mind, the reasoning above still holds.

So final answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given:
- NTPPi(x,y) [which means y is properly contained in x, not touching x's boundary]
- TPP(y,z) [which means y is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary]

Let me analyze what spatial configurations are possible:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least some space.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible because y is in the interior of x and also in z, so x and z must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x and z could partially overlap, with y in their shared region. Since y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, this arrangement works geometrically.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. x could be properly contained in z and touch z's boundary. Since y is in x and touches z's boundary, x must also touch z's boundary at those points.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible. If x were properly inside z without touching its boundary, then y (being inside x) couldn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. z could be properly contained in x and touch x's boundary. The part where y touches z's boundary would be in x's interior.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible. z could be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary. The boundary of z that y touches would be entirely in x's interior.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x and z were identical, y couldn't simultaneously touch z's boundary and not touch x's boundary.
