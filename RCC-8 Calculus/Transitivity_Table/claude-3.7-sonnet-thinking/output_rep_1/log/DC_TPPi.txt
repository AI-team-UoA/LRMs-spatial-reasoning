PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what we know:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y.

We want to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Since TPP(z,y), we know that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. This means z is "smaller" than y and touches y's boundary.

Since DC(x,y), we know x and y are disconnected, meaning they don't share any parts.

Now, let's reason about the possible relations between x and z:

1. Can x be disconnected from z (DC(x,z))?
   Yes, since x is disconnected from y, and z is a part of y, it's possible that x is disconnected from z. For example, if x and y are far apart, and z is a part of y, then x and z would also be far apart.

2. Can x be externally connected to z (EC(x,z))?
   If x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), and z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), is it possible for x to touch z at a boundary?
   Since z touches y's boundary (because it's a tangential proper part), and x is disconnected from y, it seems possible for x to touch z at the boundary where z touches y. This would make x and z externally connected.

3. Can x partially overlap with z (PO(x,z))?
   If x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), it means x and y don't share any spatial parts. Since z is a proper part of y, if x and z were to partially overlap, then x and y would also have to share a part (the overlapping part with z). But this contradicts DC(x,y). So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))?
   If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would be inside z and touch z's boundary. But since z is a proper part of y, this would mean x is inside y, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))?
   If x were a non-tangential proper part of z, then x would be inside z and not touch z's boundary. But since z is a proper part of y, this would mean x is inside y, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x))?
   If z were a tangential proper part of x, then z would be inside x and touch x's boundary. But since z is a proper part of y, this would mean that parts of x are inside y, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x))?
   If z were a non-tangential proper part of x, then z would be inside x and not touch x's boundary. But since z is a proper part of y, this would mean that parts of x are inside y, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. Can x be equal to z (EQ(x,z))?
   If x were equal to z, and z is a proper part of y, then x would also be a proper part of y. This contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider EC(x,z). We know that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means that z touches the boundary of y. But when two regions are disconnected, they don't share any parts, including boundaries. So, if x is disconnected from y, it should also be disconnected from the boundary of y. Given that z touches this boundary, it's not immediately clear if x and z can be externally connected. Let's think more about this.

Actually, let me be more precise here, TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. Hence z is the "bigger" one here. So y is a tangential proper part of z means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, and TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is inside z and touches z's boundary. 

Let's reassess the possible relations between x and z.

1. DC(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from y, and y is inside z, it's possible that x is also disconnected from z. This would be the case if x is outside of z and doesn't touch it.

2. EC(x,z):
   If x is outside of z but touches z's boundary, then x and z would be externally connected. Given that y touches z's boundary, it's possible for x to touch a part of z's boundary that y doesn't touch.

3. PO(x,z):
   If x overlaps with z but neither is a part of the other, this would mean x shares some part with z. Since y is a proper part of z, it's possible for x to overlap with z in an area different from where y is.

4. TPP(x,z):
   If x is a tangential proper part of z, it means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is also inside z and touches z's boundary, and x and y are disconnected, it's possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z as long as it doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, it means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x and y are disconnected, it's possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z as long as it doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z) (or TPP(z,x)):
   This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But we already know that y is a tangential proper part of z. If z were a part of x, then y would also be a part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (or NTPP(z,x)):
   This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But, as in the previous case, this would mean y is a part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
   If x were equal to z, then y would be a part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reanalyse the relations I marked as possible to be extra certain:

1. DC(x,z): Yes, this is possible.
2. EC(x,z): Yes, this is possible.
3. PO(x,z): Yes, this is possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Yes, this is possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Yes, this is possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): No, not possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): No, not possible.
8. EQ(x,z): No, not possible.

Actually, I'm skeptical about 3, 4, and 5. Let me redo the analysis.

DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected.
TPPi(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary. Because y is inside z, z is "bigger" than y.

Now, let's analyze:

1. DC(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from y and y is inside z, then x could be outside z. This would make x and z disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from y, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary, then x could be outside z but touch z's boundary at a point where y doesn't. This would make x and z externally connected. So, EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z):
   For x to partially overlap with z, x needs to have a part inside z. But if x has a part inside z, and y is also inside z, could x and y still be disconnected? Let's reason: If z is a larger region, and both x and y have parts inside z, they can be positioned in such a way that they don't overlap. For example, think of z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle touching the boundary of z, and x as another shape that extends from outside z to inside z, but doesn't touch y. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z):
   For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x needs to be inside z and touch z's boundary. Since y is also inside z and touches z's boundary, we need to ensure x and y are disconnected. This is possible if z is large enough and x and y are positioned far from each other inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x needs to be inside z and not touch z's boundary. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, we need to ensure x and y are disconnected. This is possible if z is large enough and x and y are positioned far from each other inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z) (or TPP(z,x)):
   For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z needs to be inside x and touch x's boundary. But we know y is inside z. If z is inside x, then y would also be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (or NTPP(z,x)):
   For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z needs to be inside x and not touch x's boundary. But, as in the previous case, this would mean y is inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z):
   If x is equal to z, then y would be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

However, I'm still a bit unsure about the possibility of TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let's reconsider.

For TPP(x,z) to be possible, x must be inside z and touch z's boundary, and x must be disconnected from y. Given that y is also inside z and touches z's boundary (because TPPi(y,z)), is it still possible for x to be disconnected from y? I believe it is, as long as z is large enough, and x and y don't overlap. They can both touch z's boundary at different points, ensuring they remain disconnected. So, TPP(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

For NTPP(x,z) to be possible, x must be inside z and not touch z's boundary, and x must be disconnected from y. Given that y is inside z and touches z's boundary, is it still possible for x to be disconnected from y? Again, I believe it is, as long as z is large enough, and x and y don't overlap. So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to further reason about one more thing. DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, or equivalently, y is properly inside z but touches z's boundary.

Now, let's consider the relation PO(x,z):
For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z must share some parts but neither is a part of the other. If x and z overlap, and y is inside z, would this mean x and y might also overlap? Not necessarily. x and z can overlap in an area that doesn't include y. For example, if z is a large circle, y is a small circle touching z's boundary from the inside, and x is a shape that partially extends into z from outside but doesn't reach where y is. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

Similarly, for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), x and y can be positioned inside z in such a way that they remain disconnected.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double check one more time by drawing some spatial layouts for each of the possibilities I've identified:

DC(x,z): x is completely outside of z, and since y is inside z, x and y are disconnected. This checks out.

EC(x,z): x touches z's boundary from the outside, and y touches z's boundary from the inside. If they touch different points of z's boundary, they remain disconnected. This checks out.

PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z, but not with the part of z that contains y. Since y is a tangential proper part of z, y doesn't fill all of z. There's room for x to overlap with z without overlapping with y. This checks out.

TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary, but doesn't overlap with y, which is also inside z and touches z's boundary. This checks out.

NTPP(x,z): x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and doesn't overlap with y, which is inside z and touches z's boundary. This checks out.

So, indeed, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

To be absolutely certain, let's re-analyze from scratch:

We have:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's go through each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): 
   For x and z to be disconnected, they must not share any points. Since y is a proper part of z, y is inside z. If x is disconnected from y, it can be outside of z. This means x and z can be disconnected. DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): 
   For x and z to be externally connected, they must touch at their boundaries. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x is disconnected from y, x can touch z's boundary at a different point from where y touches it. This means x and z can be externally connected. EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): 
   For x and z to partially overlap, they must share some interior points, but neither is a proper part of the other. Since y is a proper part of z, z has more space than just y. x can overlap with z in this additional space while remaining disconnected from y. This means x and z can partially overlap. PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): 
   For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be inside z and touch z's boundary. Since y is a tangential proper part of z, y is inside z and touches z's boundary. However, z can be large enough to contain both x and y such that they remain disconnected. This means x can be a tangential proper part of z. TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): 
   For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be inside z and not touch z's boundary. As with the previous case, z can be large enough to contain both x and y such that they remain disconnected. This means x can be a non-tangential proper part of z. NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): 
   For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be inside x and touch x's boundary. But if z is inside x, and y is inside z, then y would be inside x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. This means z cannot be a tangential proper part of x. TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): 
   For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be inside x and not touch x's boundary. As with the previous case, if z is inside x, and y is inside z, then y would be inside x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. This means z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x. NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): 
   For x to be equal to z, they must be exactly the same. But if x is the same as z, and y is inside z, then y would be inside x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. This means x cannot be equal to z. EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z when we know DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let's clarify what these relations mean:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Now I'll analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be completely outside z while y is inside z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z's boundary from the outside at a different point than where y touches z's boundary from the inside.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z in areas that don't contain y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z (inside z and touching its boundary) while remaining disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z (completely inside z) while remaining disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were inside x, then y would also be inside x (since y is inside z), contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were completely inside x, then y would also be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
