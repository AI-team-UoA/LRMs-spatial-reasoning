PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's start by understanding the given relations:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They share no spatial parts.
2. NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, y properly contains z, and z does not touch y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given these conditions.

Since DC(x,y), x is completely outside of y. Since NTPPi(y,z), z properly contains y, and y doesn't touch z's boundary. This means y is completely inside z, with some space between y's boundary and z's boundary.

Given that x is completely outside of y, and y is completely inside z with some space between y's boundary and z's boundary, what could be the relationship between x and z?

Let's consider each of the eight relations:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected? 
   - Since x is outside of y, and y is inside z, it's possible that x is also outside of z. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x touches z at a boundary but they don't share any interior parts?
   - Since x is outside of y, and y is inside z with some space between y's boundary and z's boundary, it's possible that x touches z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other?
   - Since x is outside of y, and y is inside z, it's possible that x overlaps with z in some region that doesn't include y. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   - Since x is outside of y, and y is inside z, it's possible that x is also inside z and touches z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   - Since x is outside of y, and y is inside z, it's possible that x is also inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   - This would mean that z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y is inside z, and x is outside of y. If z were inside x, then y would also be inside x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   - Similarly to TPPi, this would mean that z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But as before, this would imply that y is inside x, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are coincident?
   - If x and z were the same, then since y is inside z, y would also be inside x. But this contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning on these.

1. DC(x,z): Yes, this is possible. If x is outside of both y and z, then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Yes, this is possible. If x is outside of y but touches z's boundary, then x and z are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Yes, this is possible. If x is outside of y but overlaps with z in some region, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Yes, this is possible. If x is outside of y but is inside z and touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Yes, this is possible. If x is outside of y but is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z): No, these are not possible, as they would all imply that y is inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So, my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, upon further reflection, I think I need to re-examine my understanding of the spatial relationships, especially the NTPP/NTPPi relationship.

Let's revisit the definitions:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, y properly contains z, and z does not touch y's boundary.

So, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the situation is as follows:
- x and y have no common points (they are completely separate).
- y properly contains z, and z is completely inside y (it doesn't touch y's boundary).

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Since x is disconnected from y, and z is inside y, it follows that x is also disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is definitely a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): For x to touch z's boundary, it would also have to touch or overlap with y (since z is inside y). But since x and y are disconnected, this is not possible. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): For x to partially overlap with z, it would also have to overlap with y (since z is inside y). But since x and y are disconnected, this is not possible. So, PO(x,z) is not a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, it would have to be inside z. But since z is inside y, this would mean x is also inside y, which contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this would imply that x is inside y, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But since z is inside y, this would mean part of y is inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But since z is inside y, this would mean part of y is inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z were the same, then since z is inside y, x would also be inside y, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, based on this reconsideration, it seems that the only possible relationship between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), is DC(x,z).

OK. I think I need to be even more careful. Let me just carefully reexamine the definitions and think through the problem from the beginning.

The RCC-8 relations are:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts. They are completely separate.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. They are externally connected.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share some spatial parts, but neither is a subset of the other. They partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. It's a tangential proper part.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary. It's a non-tangential proper part.
6. TPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of TPP, which means TPP(y,x). So, y is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of NTPP, which means NTPP(y,x). So, y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region. They are equal.

Now, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), here's what we know:
- DC(x,y): x and y are completely separate.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y). So, z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y, with some space between z's boundary and y's boundary.

Let's visualize this spatially:
- y is a region.
- z is a smaller region completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- x is a region completely separate from y.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be completely separate?
   - Yes, if x and y are separate, and z is inside y, then x and z are also separate. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to touch at a boundary?
   - No, if z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is separate from y, then there's no way for x to touch z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap?
   - No, if z is inside y and x is separate from y, then there's no way for x to overlap with z. So, PO(x,z) is not a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z?
   - No, if x were inside z, then x would also be inside y (since z is inside y). But this contradicts the fact that x and y are separate. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   - No, for the same reason as TPP, this would imply that x is inside y, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x?
   - No, if z were inside x, then z would be partly inside x and partly inside y (since z is inside y). But this contradicts the fact that x and y are separate. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   - No, for the same reason as TPPi, this would imply that z is both inside x and inside y, which is not possible given DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be the same region?
   - No, if x and z were the same, then x would be inside y (since z is inside y). But this contradicts the fact that x and y are separate. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), is DC(x,z).

Hold on. I think I may be confusing myself. Let me think about this problem again and more carefully.

We have DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). Let's understand what NTPPi(y,z) means. 

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). That is, z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is entirely inside y, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

And DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected; they share no spatial parts.

So, the question is asking for the relationship between x and z, given these conditions.

First, let's consider what I know about y:
- y contains z entirely, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.
- y is disconnected from x.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected?
   - Yes, since z is inside y, and x is disconnected from y, then x is also disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be externally connected?
   - No, for x to touch z's boundary, x would have to be inside or overlapping with y (since z is inside y). But this contradicts the fact that x is disconnected from y. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap?
   - No, for x to overlap with z, x would have to be inside or overlapping with y (since z is inside y). But this contradicts the fact that x is disconnected from y. So, PO(x,z) is not a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z?
   - No, for x to be a part of z, x would have to be inside z, which would mean x is inside y (since z is inside y). But this contradicts the fact that x is disconnected from y. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   - No, for the same reason as TPP, this would imply that x is inside y, which contradicts the fact that x is disconnected from y. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x?
   - No, if z were a part of x, then z would be both inside x and inside y. But this would mean that x and y overlap, which contradicts the fact that they are disconnected. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   - No, for the same reason as TPPi, this would imply that x and y overlap, which contradicts the fact that they are disconnected. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be equal?
   - No, if x and z were equal, then x would be inside y (since z is inside y). But this contradicts the fact that x is disconnected from y. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), is DC(x,z).

Wait, I'm a bit confused and want to double-check my understanding of NTPPi(y,z). This means NTPP(z,y)... So z is a non-tangential proper part of y. But I keep saying y contains z, which actually contradicts this! Let me be extremely careful and revisit the definitions.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). NTPP(a,b) means "a is a non-tangential proper part of b." So NTPP(z,y) means "z is a non-tangential proper part of y."

So NTPPi(y,z) means "z is a non-tangential proper part of y." This means that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Actually, wait. I think I'm mixing these up again. NTPPi(a,b) means "a contains b non-tangentially." That is, NTPPi(a,b) = NTPP(b,a).

So NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y). And NTPP(z,y) means "z is a non-tangential proper part of y."

So my analysis of the problem stands. We have:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

And the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hmm, wait. I realized I may be mixed up. I'm finding the reading of the non-tangential proper part inverse kind of tricky, so let me be really careful. 

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). 

NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

OK, so I this is consistent with what I've been saying above: z is contained within y, without touching y's boundary.

Let's see. We have DC(x,y). So x and y have no parts in common.

And we have NTPPi(y,z). So z is contained within y, without touching y's boundary.

From the first relation, we know that x and y are separate regions, with no shared parts.

From the second relation, we know that z is completely within y. That is, it's surrounded by y on all sides.

Given the two conditions, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since x and y are separate, and z is completely inside y, it follows that x and z must also be separate. 

Therefore, DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, I think the problem is that I was initially confused and unsure about the notation. Let me go over the RCC-8 relations again:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected regions.
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch but don't overlap).
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary).
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary).
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (same as TPP(y,x)).
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (same as NTPP(y,x)).
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Given this, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), because x is disconnected from y, and z is completely inside y.

But wait, I'm thinking about it again. Let's be extremely careful.

We have:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, regarding the relationship between x and z, we know that:
- x is disconnected from y.
- z is completely inside y.

From these, it's clear that x and z cannot have any common points. If they did, then x would also have common points with y (since z is inside y), which contradicts the fact that x is disconnected from y.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let's visualize it geometrically to be sure:
- y is a shape (e.g., a circle).
- z is a smaller shape completely inside y (e.g., a smaller circle inside the first circle).
- x is a shape completely separate from y (e.g., a circle outside the first circle).

Given this arrangement, it's clear that x and z are also completely separate.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Argh, let me pause and try to think about a specific case, just to be fully concrete.

Imagine:
- x is a circle at position (5, 5) with radius 1.
- y is a circle at position (10, 10) with radius 3.
- z is a circle at position (10, 10) with radius 1.

Checking the relations:
- DC(x,y): The distance between the centers of x and y is sqrt((10-5)^2 + (10-5)^2) = sqrt(50) = 7.07. The sum of their radii is 1 + 3 = 4. Since 7.07 > 4, x and y are disconnected. So, DC(x,y) holds.
- NTPPi(y,z): Since z is a circle with the same center as y but a smaller radius, z is completely inside y. The distance from z's center to y's boundary is 3 - 1 = 2, which is positive. So, z doesn't touch y's boundary. This means NTPP(z,y), which is the same as NTPPi(y,z).

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:
- The distance between the centers of x and z is sqrt((10-5)^2 + (10-5)^2) = sqrt(50) = 7.07. The sum of their radii is 1 + 1 = 2. Since 7.07 > 2, x and z are disconnected. So, the relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

This specific example confirms my general conclusion: if DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then DC(x,z).

Let's just double check by trying to construct a counter-example. 

Imagine a scenario where DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), but the relationship between x and z is NOT DC(x,z). Let's see if this is possible:

1. EC(x,z): For x and z to be externally connected, they would have to touch at a boundary. But given that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is disconnected from y, it's not possible for x to touch z's boundary. So, this is not possible.

2. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, they would have to share some parts. But given that z is completely inside y and x is disconnected from y, it's not possible for x to overlap with z. So, this is not possible.

... and similarly for the other options.

I can't construct a counter-example. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), is DC(x,z).

Actually, I think I misunderstood NTPPi above (for like, the 5 time!). Let me read the original description carefully:

"NTPPi(y,z) means the same as NTPP(z,y)."

So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). And NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

OK, so NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, to recap:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

From this, it's clear that x and z must be disconnected, since z is inside y and x is disconnected from y. So, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

Let me try again with the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.

Now, I'm given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). I want to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's decode the given relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They have no points in common.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

OK. Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given these conditions.

Wait, I suddenly realized I've been analyzing it wrong all this time... Let me read the original problem description more carefully.

So NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. My conclusion that the relation must be DC(x,z) is now in doubt. Let me reconsider.

First, let's be absolutely sure about the given conditions:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They have no points in common.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given these specific conditions.

Let's think systematically. If y is completely inside z (by NTPPi(y,z)), and x doesn't share any points with y (by DC(x,y)), what are the possible ways x and z could relate?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   - This is possible if x is outside of z. Given that y is inside z, and x doesn't share any points with y, it's possible for x to be completely outside of z as well.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
   - This is possible if x is outside of z but touches the boundary of z. Given that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x doesn't share any points with y, it's possible for x to touch the boundary of z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   - This is possible if x partially overlaps with z. Given that y is inside z and x doesn't share any points with y, it's possible for x to overlap with z in a region that doesn't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x doesn't share any points with y, it's possible for x to be inside z and touch its boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - This is possible if x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x doesn't share any points with y, it's possible for x to be inside z without touching its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   - This is not possible. If z were inside x, then y would also be inside x (since y is inside z). But this contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
   - This is not possible. If x and z were the same, then y would be inside x (since y is inside z). But this contradicts the fact that x and y are disconnected.

Based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's think again about some of these and try to find counter-examples. I just want to make sure these relationships are all truly consistent with the given constraints.

I know that DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). That means x and y don't overlap at all, and y is inside z, away from z's boundary.

1. DC(x,z). x and z don't meet at all. Clearly, this is possible.

2. EC(x,z). x and z touch at the boundary, but don't overlap. The key constraint here is that x and y must remain completely separate. Given that y is inside z, there's a region of space between y and the boundary of z. If x touches z at a point on its boundary, x and y can remain separate. So, EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

3. PO(x,z). x and z partially overlap. The overlap should not include y (to ensure DC(x,y)). Given the gap between y and the boundary of z, it's possible for x to partially overlap with z without touching y. So, PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

4. TPP(x,z). x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given the gap between y and the boundary of z, it's possible for x to be inside z, touch z's boundary, and still not share any points with y. So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

5. NTPP(x,z). x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given the space inside z, it's possible for x to be inside z, away from z's boundary, and still not share any points with y. So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

I've confirmed that all five relationships are indeed possible given the constraints. So, the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me trace through a few examples again, just to double-check myself. I think I am actually correct, but I've been making a stupid error, so I just want to double-check very carefully before I give my final answer.

Let's visualize a few scenarios where DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) hold, and check the relationship between x and z in each.

Scenario 1:
- y is a small circle at (10, 10) with radius 1.
- z is a larger circle at (10, 10) with radius 3. (Note that z doesn't just contain y, it also extends beyond y, as per NTPPi(y,z).)
- x is a circle at (5, 5) with radius 1.

DC(x,y): The distance between the centers of x and y is sqrt((10-5)^2 + (10-5)^2) = sqrt(50) = 7.07. The sum of their radii is 1 + 1 = 2. Since 7.07 > 2, x and y are disconnected.

NTPPi(y,z): The distance from y's center to z's boundary is 3 - 1 = 2, which is positive. So, y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Relationship between x and z: The distance between the centers of x and z is 7.07. The sum of their radii is 1 + 3 = 4. Since 7.07 > 4, x and z are disconnected. So, the relationship is DC(x,z).

Scenario 2 (adjusting the position of x to touch z):
- y is a small circle at (10, 10) with radius 1.
- z is a larger circle at (10, 10) with radius 3.
- x is a circle at (6, 6) with radius 2.

DC(x,y): The distance between the centers of x and y is 5.66. The sum of their radii is 3. Since 5.66 > 3, x and y are disconnected.

NTPPi(y,z): Same as before.

Relationship between x and z: The distance between the centers of x and z is 5.66. The sum of their radii is 5. Since 5.66 > 5, x and z don't overlap. But the distance is only slightly larger than the sum of the radii, so they are close. If we adjust the position slightly, we can make them touch. So, the relationship can be EC(x,z).

With further adjustments, we can also achieve PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Making sure I understand the questions:

1. DC(x,y): x and y don't overlap at all. None of x is contained in y and vice versa.
2. NTPPi(y,z): y is contained inside z, not touching z's boundary.

OK, so with these constraints in mind, I need to think through all 8 possible relations between x and z.

Let me visualize: I've got region y that's inside region z, away from z's boundary. I've also got a region x that is disconnected from y. I need to think: what are the possible relations between x and z, satisfying these constraints?

1. DC(x,z): x and z don't overlap at all.
   - This is possible if x is outside of z. Given that y is inside z, and x doesn't share any points with y, it's possible for x to be completely outside of z as well.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors.
   - This is possible if x is outside of z but touches the boundary of z. Given that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x doesn't share any points with y, it's possible for x to touch the boundary of z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   - This is possible if x partially overlaps with z. Given that y is inside z and x doesn't share any points with y, it's possible for x to overlap with z in a region that doesn't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary).
   - This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x doesn't share any points with y, it's possible for x to be inside z and touch its boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary).
   - This is possible if x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x doesn't share any points with y, it's possible for x to be inside z without touching its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary).
   - This would mean that z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But since y is inside z, this would imply that y is also inside x. But we know DC(x,y), which means y and x are disconnected. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not a valid relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary).
   - Similar to TPPi, this would imply that y is inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not valid either.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
   - If x and z are the same, then y is inside x (since y is inside z). But this contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not a valid relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Having though this through multiple times and carefully, I'm confident that this is the correct list.

The possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

Given the conditions DC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

First, let me clarify what these conditions mean:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Now I'll analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Since x is disconnected from y, and y is inside z, x can be completely outside z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z's boundary while still remaining disconnected from y (which is inside z away from the boundary).

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z in a region that doesn't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z (inside z, touching z's boundary) while remaining disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z (completely inside z) while still being disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were inside x, then y would also be inside x (since y is inside z), contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
