PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me understand these relationships and figure out what's possible between $x$ and $z$.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained entirely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, let's think about what relationship x and z could have.

Since z is contained entirely within y (NTPPi(y,z)), and y is contained entirely within x (NTPPi(x,y)), we know that z is contained entirely within x. This means that z is a proper part of x.

But we need to determine whether z is a tangential proper part (TPP) or non-tangential proper part (NTPP) of x.

If z touches the boundary of x, then TPP(z,x) would hold. But we know that z doesn't even touch the boundary of y (because NTPPi(y,z)), and y doesn't touch the boundary of x (because NTPPi(x,y)). So z definitely doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x). 

In the RCC-8 notation, this would be NTPPi(z,x).

Actually, I made a mistake. NTPPi(z,x) would mean "x is a non-tangential proper part of z", which is not what we derived. What we derived is NTPP(z,x), which means "z is a non-tangential proper part of x".

So the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x).

Wait, actually, I believe I might have been interpreting the notation wrong. Let me double-check. NTPPi(x,y) means that NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

OK, now I have been more careful. Here's what we have:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So we have:
- y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

From these, we can deduce that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I'm still not 100% sure whether NTPPi(x,y) means "x is a non-tangential proper part of y" or "y is a non-tangential proper part of x". Let me parse the problem statement in more detail.

The problem says: "NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)". This means that NTPPi(x,y) means "y is a non-tangential proper part of x". And similarly, NTPPi(y,z) means "z is a non-tangential proper part of y".

So, from the given conditions:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since y is entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary, and z is entirely contained within y without touching y's boundary, z must be entirely contained within x without touching x's boundary. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x). Equivalently, this can be expressed as NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I still don't feel confident. So let me try to visualize these relationships to make sure.

Visualize NTPPi(x,y):
X: [                   ]
Y:     [         ]

Here, Y is entirely inside X and doesn't touch X's boundary, which is what NTPPi(x,y) means.

Visualize NTPPi(y,z):
Y: [                   ]
Z:     [         ]

Now, combining the two visualizations, we have:
X: [                           ]
Y:     [                   ]
Z:          [         ]

So Z is entirely inside X and doesn't touch X's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Yes, I believe the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I need to be systematic here. Let me avoid relying on this "i" notation for a moment and think in terms of the basic relations. We have:

- NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y

From these, it follows that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x).

Going back to the "i" notation, since NTPPi(x,z) is the same as NTPP(z,x), we can say that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, to double check, let me re-parse the problem statement one more time. Ah, I see where I might be getting confused:

"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. And NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is NTPP(z,x) or, equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double check this conclusion. 

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is strictly inside x, without touching x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means z is strictly inside y, without touching y's boundary.

From these, it follows that z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z).

However, I also need to check if there are other possible relationships between x and z. Given the constraints, I don't think there are other possibilities, but let me check other relations to be sure:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because z is inside y, which is inside x.
2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is also impossible because z is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside x, so z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is impossible because z is strictly inside x.
4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is impossible because x contains y, which contains z.
5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is also impossible because x contains y, which contains z.
6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because z is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside x, so z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
7. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is impossible because z is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside x, so x is strictly larger than z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Now that I check again, I realize that the question is asking for the relationship between x and z, given the conditions. And we've determined that the relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double check from another angle, again. Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is properly inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is properly inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Now, let's visualize these relationships:

X: [                                   ]
Y:     [                         ]
Z:           [             ]

In this visualization:
- Y is a proper part of X and does not touch X's boundary.
- Z is a proper part of Y and does not touch Y's boundary.

Now, looking at the relationship between X and Z, we can see that Z is also a proper part of X and does not touch X's boundary. This means NTPP(z,x) or, equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I believe there could be another approach to this problem. Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), or y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), or z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, if y is a non-tangential proper part of x and z is a non-tangential proper part of y, then z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. This is a transitive relationship. So NTPP(z,x), which means NTPPi(x,z).

I'm convinced that the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be systematic and check systematically whether any subset of the original eight possibilities is compatible with the given information.

Given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), what's the relationship between x and z? Let's analyze:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Is this possible?
   If z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z must be inside x. Therefore, DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. Is this possible?
   For z to touch the boundary of x, z would have to touch the boundary of y (which it doesn't due to NTPPi(y,z)) or y would have to touch the boundary of x (which it doesn't due to NTPPi(x,y)). Therefore, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Is this possible?
   For this to be true, z would have to extend beyond the boundary of x, which is impossible given the nested relationships. Therefore, PO(x,z) is impossible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Is this possible?
   This would imply that z contains x, which contradicts the given relationships. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Is this possible?
   This would also imply that z contains x, which contradicts the given relationships. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Is this possible?
   For z to touch the boundary of x, z would have to touch the boundary of y (which it doesn't due to NTPPi(y,z)) or y would have to touch the boundary of x (which it doesn't due to NTPPi(x,y)). Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Is this possible?
   Given the nested relationships, z is inside y, which is inside x, and neither z nor y touches the boundary of the outer region. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. Is this possible?
   This contradicts the given relationships, as z must be strictly inside y, which is strictly inside x. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Based on this exhaustive analysis, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, my answer to the question "If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just double check my work with some slightly more detailed pictures:

```
            x
+---------------------------+
|                           |
|         y                 |
|    +-------------+        |
|    |             |        |
|    |      z      |        |
|    |  +------+   |        |
|    |  |      |   |        |
|    |  |      |   |        |
|    |  +------+   |        |
|    |             |        |
|    +-------------+        |
|                           |
+---------------------------+
```

If NTPPi(x,y), then y is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is what I've shown. And if NTPPi(y,z), then z is entirely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, which I've also shown.

Given these constraints, z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which means NTPPi(x,z).

So my answer is correct.

Maybe I got confused if there were alternate possibilities. But as I've checked each of the 8 possible relationships, only NTPPi(x,z) is compatible with the given constraints.

Let me also recall the definitions of the relations briefly, just to be sure:

- DC(x,y): Disconnected — x and y share no points.
- EC(x,y): Externally connected — x and y touch at their boundaries, but share no interior points.
- PO(x,y): Partially overlapping — x and y share some, but not all, points.
- TPP(x,y): Tangential proper part — x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): Non-tangential proper part — x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): Inverse of TPP — y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): Inverse of NTPP — y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,y): Equal — x and y are the same region.

Based on these definitions and the given scenario, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I am not being precise enough on where confusion could arise. Let me be really clear:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, we can deduce:
- If y is a proper part of x and z is a proper part of y, then z must also be a proper part of x.
- If y does not touch the boundary of x and z does not touch the boundary of y, then z cannot touch the boundary of x.

So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or, equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Based on this, I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relationship between x and z follows from the given conditions.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)

I'll analyze what this means for the relationship between x and z by examining all possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible - z cannot be disconnected from x when z is inside y and y is inside x
2. EC(x,z): Impossible - z cannot touch only the boundary of x when z doesn't touch y's boundary
3. PO(x,z): Impossible - z cannot partially overlap x when z is completely inside y and y is inside x
4. TPP(x,z): Impossible - x cannot be a proper part of z when z is inside y and y is inside x
5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible - same reason as above
6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible - z cannot touch x's boundary when z doesn't touch y's boundary
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z is completely inside y, which is completely inside x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary
8. EQ(x,z): Impossible - x and z cannot be equal when z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
