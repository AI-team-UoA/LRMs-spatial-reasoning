PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step. 

We are given that:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither is part of the other.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)). This means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's remember what TPP(z,y) means: z is completely contained within y but touches y's boundary. And PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap.

Given these constraints, let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible. Since z is a proper part of y, and x only partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x overlaps with parts of y that don't include z, making x and z disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors.
   This is possible. Since z touches y's boundary, if x overlaps with y at that specific boundary, then x and z could be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some parts, but neither is part of the other.
   This is possible. Since z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x overlaps with parts of y that include some (but not all) of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given that z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, is it possible for x to be completely contained within z? If x is completely within z, and z is completely within y, then x would be completely within y, contradicting PO(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Following the same reasoning as for TPP(x,z), if x is completely within z, and z is completely within y, then x would be completely within y, contradicting PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. Given PO(x,y), some part of x is outside y. But z is completely within y. So, z cannot be completely within x, because otherwise, the part of x outside y would be outside z. Hence, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me reconsider this. If z is completely contained within x, and some part of x is outside y, it doesn't necessarily lead to a contradiction. It's possible that z is completely inside x while still being completely inside y. So, TPPi(x,z) might still be possible.

Let's try a different approach. If TPPi(x,z), or equivalently TPP(z,x), this means z is a proper part of x. We're also given that TPP(z,y), meaning z is a proper part of y. This means z is within the intersection of x and y. Since PO(x,y), this implies that x has parts outside y. Since z is completely within y, it cannot include these parts of x that are outside y. Therefore, z would indeed be a proper part of x, making TPPi(x,z) possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similarly, it's possible that z is completely contained within the interior of x. Given that z touches y's boundary, and x only partially overlaps with y, this can happen if z is contained within the part of x that's inside y. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Again, let's reconsider. If NTPPi(x,z), or equivalently NTPP(z,x), this means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given TPP(z,y), z touches y's boundary. If z is so deeply inside x that it doesn't touch x's boundary, then z's touching of y's boundary implies that y's boundary must be somewhere inside x, not on x's boundary. But then, this doesn't align with PO(x,y), where x and y overlap without one being a proper part of the other.

Wait, let me think again. PO(x,y) means that some part of x is outside y, and some part of y is outside x. TPP(z,y) means that z is within y and touches y's boundary. If NTPP(z,x), then z is within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This can happen if, for example, z is at the boundary of y, which is inside the part of x that overlaps with y.

Actually, I think the problem is with my understanding of TPP. TPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. This doesn't necessarily mean that z is at y's boundary; it means z touches y's boundary from the inside. So, if z touches y's boundary from within, and z is also within x, then z can touch x's boundary, making TPP(z,x) possible, or it might not touch x's boundary, making NTPP(z,x) possible.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are the same region, and PO(x,y), then PO(z,y). But we're given that TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y), indicating that z is a proper part of y. This contradicts PO(z,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me re-examine this again.

Let's reconsider the problem:
- PO(x,y) means x and y share some parts, but neither is a part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a TPP of y.

So, x and y overlap, and z is completely within y but touches y's boundary.

I think I need to consider the exact relationship between PO and TPPi more carefully.

Let's go through each relation again:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Given that z is within y (due to TPP(z,y)), and x overlaps with y (due to PO(x,y)), x and z can be disconnected if the part of y that x overlaps with doesn't include z. This is entirely possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors.
   Since z touches y's boundary, if the part of y that x overlaps with includes that specific boundary point, then x and z could be externally connected. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some parts, but neither is part of the other.
   This is possible. As x overlaps with y, and z is within y, x could overlap with a part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x would need to be completely within z and touch z's boundary. Given that z is completely within y, if x is completely within z, then x would be completely within y. This contradicts PO(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to TPP(x,z), this would require x to be completely within z, which would contradict PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely within x. Given that z is also completely within y, z would need to be in the intersection of x and y. But TPP(z,y) only means z touches y's boundary, not specifically the boundary between x and y. If z is in the intersection of x and y and touches the part of y's boundary that's not shared with x, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similarly, z can be completely within the interior of x and not touch x's boundary. This can happen if z is in the intersection of x and y and doesn't touch the boundary of the overlapping region. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are the same region, and PO(x,y), then PO(z,y). But TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y. A region can't be a proper part of a region it partially overlaps with. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me double check this again.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y. In other words, z is completely within y, but it touches the boundary of y.

Let's go through each relation systematically:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Since z is completely within y and x partly overlaps with y, it's possible that x and z don't have any common parts. For instance, if y is a big circle, z is a small circle within y that touches y's boundary, and x is a circle that overlaps with a different part of y, then x and z can be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch but don't overlap.
   x and z can touch if they share a boundary point. For instance, if z touches y's boundary at a point where x also overlaps with y, then x and z can be externally connected. So, EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   x can overlap with a part of z while not being a proper part of z, and z not being a proper part of x. This can happen if x overlaps with a part of y that includes a part of z. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x must be completely within z and touch z's boundary. If x is completely within z, and z is completely within y, then x is completely within y. But we're given that PO(x,y), which means x overlaps with y but is not completely within it. This is a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Following the same reasoning as for TPP(x,z), if x is completely within z, and z is completely within y, then x is completely within y, contradicting PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be completely within x and touch x's boundary. Given that z is also completely within y and touches y's boundary, this is possible if the boundary point of y that z touches is within or at the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be completely within the interior of x, meaning it doesn't touch x's boundary. We're also given that z touches y's boundary. These two can be consistent if the boundary of y that z touches is within the interior of x. This can happen if x extends well beyond the boundary of y at the point where z touches y's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are the same region, then since z is completely within y, x would also be completely within y. This contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Wait, I don't think that's quite right when I said "if z is completely within y, and PO(x,y), then PO(z,y)". We are given z is a proper part of y, which means it's contained within y, not that it PO with y.

Let's re-examine again.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Given PO(x,y), x partially overlaps with y. Since z is completely within y, x and z can be disconnected if x overlaps with a part of y that doesn't include z. This is a possible relation. Think of y as a big circle, z as a small circle touching the boundary of y, and x as a circle that overlaps with a part of y not including z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch but don't overlap.
   This can happen if x overlaps with y at the exact point where z touches the boundary of y. So, x and z would touch at that point without sharing any interior. This is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   If x overlaps with a part of y that includes a part of z, then x and z can partially overlap. This is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x must be completely within z and touch z's boundary. If x is completely within z, and z is completely within y, then x is completely within y. This contradicts PO(x,y). So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Following the same reasoning as for TPP(x,z), if x is completely within z, and z is completely within y, then x is completely within y, contradicting PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be completely within x and touch x's boundary. Given that z is also completely within y and touches y's boundary, z would need to be in the overlap of x and y and touch both x's and y's boundaries. This is a possible relation. For example, imagine y is a big circle, z is a small circle touching the boundary of y, and x is a circle that overlaps with y in such a way that z is completely within the overlapping region and touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be completely within the interior of x, meaning it doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that z touches y's boundary, for both to be true, x would need to extend well beyond the boundary of y at the point where z touches y's boundary. This is possible if the boundary of y that z touches is well within the interior of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z are the same region, then since z is completely within y, x would also be completely within y. This contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But the more I think about it, I'm having trouble seeing how NTPPi(x,z) is possible. I said NTPPi(x,z) is possible if the boundary of y that z touches is well within the interior of x. But if z touches y's boundary, and z is completely within the interior of x, then y's boundary must intersect x's interior.

Let's try to visualize this:
- PO(x,y) means x and y overlap, but neither is a part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Imagine:
- y is a big circle.
- z is a small circle inside y that touches y's boundary at a single point.
- If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x's interior. This means z doesn't touch x's boundary.

But z touches y's boundary. So, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, y's boundary at the point where z touches it must be inside x's interior. This means x extends well beyond y at that point.

Is this possible given PO(x,y)? For PO(x,y), x and y must overlap, and there must be parts of x outside y and parts of y outside x. So, it seems theoretically possible that x extends well beyond y at the point where z touches y's boundary, making NTPPi(x,z) a possible relation.

However, I'm having trouble visualizing a 2D example where NTPPi(x,z) holds given the conditions. Let me see if we can construct one.

Imagine a big circle for y, a small circle z inside y touching y's boundary at a point. Now, for NTPPi(x,z), I need an x that contains z completely within its interior, and for PO(x,y), x should overlap with y but not be a part of y or vice versa.

If x is another circle that contains z completely inside its interior, then x would necessarily extend outside y for PO(x,y) to hold. But then, the point where z touches y's boundary would be inside x's interior. Is this a valid RCC8 scenario? I'm not certain anymore.

Actually, let me start from a more basic question: If a point is on the boundary of one region and in the interior of another, is that a valid scenario in RCC8? I believe the answer is yes, as regions can overlap in complex ways.

So, NTPPi(x,z) seems intuitively possible. z can be completely within x's interior, while still touching y's boundary from the inside.

Similarly, TPPi(x,z) is also possible. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, while also touching y's boundary from the inside.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me verify TPPi(x,z) more:
TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a proper part of x (completely within x) and touches x's boundary.
Given TPP(z,y), z is completely within y and touches y's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z should be completely within both x and y, and touch both x's and y's boundaries. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y includes z.

So yes, the possible relations are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I want to do one more check on NTPPi(x,z):

NTPPi(x,z) means z is completely within x's interior and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPP(z,y) means z is completely within y and touches y's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z should be within x's interior, not touching x's boundary. However, z does touch y's boundary. This is possible if the part of y's boundary that z touches is inside the interior of x, which can happen if x extends beyond y at that point.

Hmm, I'm thinking that I might be having some difficulty picturing a valid configuration for NTPPi(x,z).

If z touches y's boundary, and z is in the interior of x, then at the point where z touches y's boundary, y's boundary must be inside x's interior. This means that at that point, x extends beyond y.

For PO(x,y), x and y must overlap, and neither should be a part of the other. This means there's a part of x that's not in y, and there's a part of y that's not in x. Given these conditions, there's a boundary of overlap between x and y.

Now, if z is inside this overlapping region but not touching the boundary of overlap, then z could be touching y's exterior boundary (the part of y's boundary that's not shared with x) from the inside, while being completely inside x's interior.

Actually, the more I think about it, the more I can see NTPPi(x,z) as possible, given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check by visualizing counter-examples for the impossible relations:

1. TPP(x,z): If x is completely within z, and z is completely within y, then x is completely within y. This contradicts PO(x,y). It's not possible.

2. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, it's not possible for x to be completely within the interior of z. If it were, then x would be completely within y, contradicting PO(x,y).

3. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same, then x is completely within y (since z is). This contradicts PO(x,y). So, it's not possible for them to be equal.

These checks confirm that the relations DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are the possible ones.

But I still have a feeling I might be missing something, especially with the NTPPi(x,z) case. Let's revisit:

- PO(x,y) means x and y overlap. There's a part of x that's in y, and there's a part of x that's not in y.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a TPP of y. This means z is completely within y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z) means z is completely within the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given that z touches y's boundary, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, the part of y's boundary that z touches must be in x's interior. This means x extends beyond y at that point, which is consistent with PO(x,y).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

OK, let me check each of these in detail one more time:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Given PO(x,y), x overlaps with y, but there might be parts of y that x doesn't overlap with. If z is in a part of y that x doesn't overlap with, then x and z are disconnected, making DC(x,z) a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
   Since z touches y's boundary, if x also touches or crosses y's boundary at the same point, then x and z can be externally connected, making EC(x,z) a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   If x overlaps with a part of y that includes a part of z, then x and z can partially overlap, making PO(x,z) a possible relation.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be completely within x and touch x's boundary. Given that z is also completely within y and touches y's boundary, this is possible if the part of y's boundary that z touches is at or coincident with x's boundary at some point. Think of z as being completely inside both x and y, and touching the boundary of both at a single point. This makes TPPi(x,z) a possible relation.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, z must be completely within the interior of x, meaning it doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that z touches y's boundary, for both to be true, the part of y's boundary that z touches must be inside x's interior. This means x extends beyond y at that point. Given PO(x,y), this is a possible scenario, making NTPPi(x,z) a possible relation.

But wait, if the part of y's boundary that z touches is inside x's interior, then the boundary of y would need to cross into x's interior, which seems to violate the concept of a boundary in typical topological contexts.

Let me try once more:

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. z also touches y's boundary, which must be inside x. But if y's boundary is inside x, how does that reconcile with PO(x,y)?

For PO(x,y), x and y overlap, and there is a boundary where they overlap. If part of y's boundary is inside x, it would mean that x goes "around" y at that point, which is a complex relationship. But is it a valid RCC-8 configuration?

Actually, I think I've been thinking about RCC-8 too rigidly in terms of simple circular relationships. In a more general topological context, it's definitely possible for one region to have parts of its boundary inside another.

For example, consider a U-shaped region x and a region y that overlaps with the "inside" part of the U and extends beyond it. The parts of y's boundary that are inside the U would be in the interior of x, but y and x would still be in a PO relationship.

In this setup, if z is a small region inside the overlapping part of x and y, touching the part of y's boundary that's inside x, then z would be completely within x's interior, not touching x's boundary, while also touching y's boundary. This gives us NTPPi(x,z) as a valid configuration.

So, after reviewing in detail, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually DC(x,z) seems most natural in many cases. For instance, if y is a big region (e.g. a big circle), z is a small region inside y (e.g. a small circle inside the big circle and touching its boundary), and x is another small region inside y (e.g. another small circle inside the big circle but not touching the boundary). In this case, x and z would be disconnected, which is DC(x,z). This is a very common situation in practice.

EC(x,z) is also reasonable. If z touches the boundary of y in a place that is on the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y, then x and z share a single point of connection – actually the point at which z touches the boundary of y.

PO(x,z) is another common natural configuration. Since z is a proper part of y, and x overlaps with y, x can overlap with z in a way where some of z is inside x and some of z is outside x, making PO(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) is possible if z is completely within x but touches x's boundary. Given that z is a TPP of y, it can be that the part of y's boundary that z touches coincides with the boundary of x, making TPPi(x,z).

NTPPi(x,z) is also possible as I've detailed, though it requires a more complex relationship between x and y and z.

So, the possible relations are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double check by using a proof based on the composition of these relations:
If R1(x,y) and R2(y,z), then the possible relations between x and z are given by the composition of R1 and R2, denoted as R1 * R2.

In our case, R1 is PO and R2 is TPPi.

Let's check if the composition PO * TPPi includes DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi, and doesn't include TPP, NTPP, and EQ.

I'm going to refer to the composition table of RCC-8. The composition PO * TPPi is the set of relations that can occur between x and z when PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

According to the composition table, PO * TPPi = {DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi}

This is exactly the set of relations I concluded! So, my analysis is consistent with the composition table.

So the possible relations between x and z, given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible spatial relationships between x and z given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Since z is inside y and x only partially overlaps with y, x can overlap with parts of y that don't include z, making x and z disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x overlaps with y at the exact point where z touches y's boundary, then x and z can be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x overlaps with a part of y that includes part (but not all) of z, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were completely within z, and z is completely within y, then x would be completely within y, contradicting PO(x,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP - it would force x to be completely within y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely within the part of x that overlaps with y, and z touches x's boundary at some point.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely contained within the interior of x (not touching x's boundary) while still touching y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then x would be completely within y, contradicting PO(x,y).
