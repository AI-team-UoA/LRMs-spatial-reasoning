PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what the given relations mean and then figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- x and y partially overlap
- z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary

Now I need to figure out what the possible relationships between x and z could be.

Let's consider each of the 8 possible RCC-8 relations and see if they're consistent with what we know:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
   Is this possible? Since z is completely inside y and x overlaps with y, it's possible that the overlap between x and y doesn't include any part of z. So x and z could be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries
   Is this possible? We know that z doesn't touch y's boundary, and z is completely inside y. So z's boundary is strictly inside y. Since x can overlap with y in any way as long as neither is contained in the other, it's possible that x touches z at its boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I need to think more carefully. If z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then there's some "buffer" between z and the outside of y. For x to touch z (EC), x would have to reach inside y to touch z's boundary. But this means that x would have to overlap with y, which is consistent with PO(x,y). So EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   Is this possible? Yes, x can overlap with part of z while still having parts outside of z, and z can have parts that don't overlap with x. This is consistent with z being inside y and x overlapping with y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   Is this possible? If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, then since z is completely inside y, x would also be completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(x,y) which says that x has parts outside of y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to rethink. TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. But we don't know that x would have to be completely inside y. It's possible that x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and z is inside y without touching y's boundary. But this would mean that x is completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is still not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   Is this possible? If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x is also completely inside y. But this contradicts PO(x,y) which says that x has parts outside of y. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   Is this possible? TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), so z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. But we know that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z doesn't touch y's boundary. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and x overlaps with y, then z might end up touching y's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to think more carefully. TPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, it doesn't necessarily mean that z touches y's boundary. It depends on how x overlaps with y. But if z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z is also inside x and touches x's boundary, then part of x must be outside of y (which is consistent with PO(x,y)). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me reconsider. We have NTPPi(y,z), which means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If z is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)), then z touches x's boundary. Since x and y partially overlap (PO(x,y)), x's boundary could be partially inside y and partially outside y. If z touches the part of x's boundary that's inside y, then we're fine. But if z touches the part of x's boundary that's outside y, then z would have to extend outside y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). So we need to be careful.

Wait, I'm making this too complicated. TPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, for z to be inside x, at least part of x must be inside y. And for z to touch x's boundary, but not touch y's boundary, x's boundary must extend into the interior of y. This is all consistent with PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Is this possible? NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), so z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, for z to be inside x, at least part of x must be inside y. This is consistent with PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are the same region
   Is this possible? If x and z are the same, then z would have to overlap with y (because x overlaps with y), but not be completely inside y (because x is not completely inside y due to PO(x,y)). But this contradicts NTPPi(y,z) which says that z is completely inside y. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider. EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region. We know that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPPi(y,z)). If x and z are the same, then x would also be completely inside y and not touch y's boundary. But this contradicts PO(x,y) which says that x and y share some parts but neither is part of the other. So EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I want to double-check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z). 

TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), so z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. We know that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For z to be inside x, at least part of x must be inside y. For z to touch x's boundary, either:
1. x's boundary extends into the interior of y, or
2. x's boundary is the same as y's boundary at some points.

In case 1, z touches a part of x's boundary that's inside y, which is fine.
In case 2, if z touches x's boundary at points where it's the same as y's boundary, then z would touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z).

But since we know that x and y partially overlap (PO(x,y)), x's boundary must extend into the interior of y at some points. And z can touch x's boundary at those points without touching y's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me also double-check EC(x,z).

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. We know that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For x and z to touch at their boundaries, x must extend into the interior of y (which is consistent with PO(x,y)). So EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x

However, wait, I think I need to rethink my logic for DC(x,z). Let me visualize the scenario more carefully.

We know:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is fully part of the other.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is fully contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z should be disconnected (no shared part and no touching).

Since z is fully within y (away from y's boundary), and x shares a part with y, there are two possibilities:
1. The shared part between x and y contains some or all of z.
2. The shared part between x and y doesn't overlap with z at all.

In case 1, x and z would share a part, which contradicts DC(x,z).
In case 2, x and z could indeed be disconnected.

So, DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Now, let me also rethink EC(x,z) to make sure of my logic. For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z should touch at their boundaries but not share any interior points.

Since z is fully within y (away from y's boundary), and x shares a part with y, there are two possibilities:
1. The shared part between x and y contains some or all of z.
2. The shared part between x and y doesn't overlap with z at all.

In case 1, if the shared part includes some of z's interior, then x and z would share interior points, which contradicts EC(x,z). But if the shared part only intersects with z's boundary, then EC(x,z) would be possible.
In case 2, x and z could touch at their boundaries, which allows EC(x,z).

So, EC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Continuing the check for the other relationships...

PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, they should share some interior points, but neither should be fully part of the other. Since z is fully within y, and x shares a part with y, x and z can indeed partially overlap as long as neither is fully inside the other. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z should be fully within x and touch x's boundary. Since z is fully within y (and doesn't touch y's boundary), if z is also fully within x, then at least part of x must be within y. This is consistent with PO(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z should be fully within x and not touch x's boundary. Since z is fully within y (and doesn't touch y's boundary), if z is also fully within x and away from x's boundary, then at least part of x must be within y. This is consistent with PO(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I'll analyze the possible relationships between x and z based on the given conditions:

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Let me evaluate each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Since z is completely inside y (away from y's boundary), and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that the overlap between x and y doesn't include any part of z. So x and z could be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x could extend into y just enough to touch z's boundary without sharing interior points, while still partially overlapping with y.

3. PO(x,z): x could overlap with part of z while still having parts outside of both z and y, consistent with the given relations.

4. TPP(x,z): If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would be completely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y). Not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this would require x to be completely inside y. Not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary, while x partially overlaps with y. This is consistent with z being completely inside y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while x partially overlaps with y.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z were equal, x would be completely inside y, contradicting PO(x,y). Not possible.
