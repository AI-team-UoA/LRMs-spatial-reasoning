PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this carefully. We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

We need to determine all possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's understand what the two given relationships mean for the positioning of x, y, and z:

From EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch only at their boundaries.

From TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z but touches z's boundary at some point.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   If y touches z's boundary and x only touches y's boundary, it's possible that x doesn't touch z at all, placing x entirely outside z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are externally connected?
   If y touches z's boundary at a point where x also touches y, then x could also touch z at that point. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   If x touches y only at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z (touching z's boundary), then x might overlap with z in some region. This is possible if the boundary of y where x touches it is not completely aligned with the boundary of z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   If x touches y only at the boundary and that boundary point is inside z (not at z's boundary), then x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary at some other point. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   If x touches y only at the boundary and that boundary point is inside z (not at z's boundary), then x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) - Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean z is completely inside x but touches x's boundary. However, we know y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is completely inside z. Since x only touches y at the boundary, it cannot contain all of z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) - Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. For similar reasons as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   This would mean x and z are the same region. However, since y is a proper part of z and x only touches y at the boundary, x cannot be equal to z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning for PO, TPP, and NTPP. Let me reconsider:

For PO(x,z): 
Since EC(x,y), x and y touch only at their boundaries. And since TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary. If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x could partially overlap with z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, it needs to be completely inside z while touching z's boundary. Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), if x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, it's hard to see how x could be completely inside z. So I don't think TPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me reconsider again. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, then x could potentially touch z at that same point. But for x to be a proper part of z, it would need to be completely inside z. Given that x only touches y at the boundary and y is a proper part of z, it seems unlikely that x could be completely inside z.

For NTPP(x,z):
For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, it needs to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), this seems impossible. If x touches y's boundary, it can't be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Let me step back and just draw the situations in my mind to see what the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z could be.

From EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary.
From TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Case 1: x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary.
In this case, x is outside of z, and may or may not touch z.
- If x doesn't touch z, then DC(x,z).
- If x happens to touch z at some point (not through y), then EC(x,z).

Case 2: x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary.
In this case, x might touch z as well, making EC(x,z) possible.

Case 3: x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, but x partially overlaps with z.
This gives us PO(x,z).

Let me double-check the PO case more carefully. If EC(x,y), then x and y share no interior points. If TPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z. For x to partially overlap with z, some part of x must be inside z and some part outside. Given EC(x,y), it's possible that x touches y at y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of z, resulting in PO(x,z). So I believe PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

However, I'm less convinced about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let's think more:

For TPP(x,z), x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z (touching z's boundary), it's hard to see how x could be completely inside z unless x is very small and positioned in a specific way. But I can't rule it out completely.

For NTPP(x,z), x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This seems even less likely given EC(x,y).

Actually, I'll draw out the scenarios again to clarify:

From EC(x,y): x and y share no interior points, but their boundaries touch.
From TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): x and y touch at their boundaries, but at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary. x is completely outside of z and doesn't touch z. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and y touch at their boundaries, and this point is also on z's boundary (where y touches z), so x also touches z's boundary. Alternatively, x and y touch at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, but x happens to touch z at another point. Both scenarios make EC(x,z) possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other. For this to happen, part of x would need to be inside z. Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), can x have a part inside z?

   If x and y touch at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x extends into z from that point, then x could have a part inside z. But this contradicts EC(x,y) since it would mean x and y share interior points.

   Actually, let me think through this again. If x and y touch at their boundaries, x could still have a part that extends into z without overlapping with y. This would make PO(x,z) possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), it's hard to see how x could be completely inside z if it only touches y at their boundaries.

   Actually, let's consider a specific scenario: z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x is an even smaller circle inside z that touches y's boundary at one point and also touches z's boundary at another point. In this scenario, TPP(x,z) would hold. So it seems TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), if x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, it's possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z. Since x only touches y at the boundary, it cannot contain all of z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): Similarly to the above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. Given the constraints, this is not possible.

Now, let's double check this again. 

From EC(x,y): x and y share no interior parts, but their boundaries touch. Conceptually, we can imagine x and y as adjacent regions.
From TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is entirely inside z, but there is at least one point where y touches the boundary of z.

Let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z share no parts and do not touch. 
   This is possible. x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x doesn't touch z anywhere else. So x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. 
   This is possible. x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, so x and z can be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other. 
   For this to happen, x needs to have a part inside z. Given EC(x,y), x can extend into z for this to happen, making PO(x,z) possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. 
   For this to happen, x needs to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), it's possible for x to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary (either directly or through the point where y touches z's boundary). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Hold on, I need to be more careful. If EC(x,y), then x and y only touch at their boundaries. If TPP(y,z), then y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. For TPP(x,z) to hold, x needs to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary.

Let's think of a specific scenario: z is a big square, y is a smaller square inside z touching z's boundary, and x is a tiny rectangle outside of z but touching y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary. In this scenario, DC(x,z) would hold.

Another scenario: z is a big square, y is a smaller square inside z touching z's boundary, and x is a tiny rectangle outside of z but touching y at the point where y touches z's boundary. In this scenario, EC(x,z) would hold.

For PO(x,z), consider a scenario where z is a big square, y is a smaller square inside z touching z's boundary, and x is a rectangle that touches y's boundary and extends partly inside z and partly outside z. This makes PO(x,z) possible.

For TPP(x,z), consider a scenario where z is a big square, y is a smaller square inside z touching z's boundary, and x is a tiny rectangle inside z that touches both y's boundary and z's boundary. This makes TPP(x,z) possible.

For NTPP(x,z), consider a scenario where z is a big square, y is a smaller square inside z touching z's boundary, and x is a tiny rectangle inside z that touches y's boundary but does not touch z's boundary. This makes NTPP(x,z) possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z would need to be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. Given that y is entirely inside z (from TPP(y,z)) and x only touches y at a boundary point (from EC(x,y)), it's not possible for z to be entirely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would need to be the same region. Given the constraints, this is not possible.

Actually, I just realized I made a critical mistake in my last analysis. 

Let's step back and think carefully. We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y share no interior parts, but their boundaries touch. Conceptually, we can imagine them as adjacent regions.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's think in terms of the 8 possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible if x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x doesn't touch z anywhere else. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary, and x as a tiny circle outside of z but touching y's boundary at a point away from where y touches z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.
   This is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, so x indirectly touches z's boundary. Alternatively, x could touch z directly at another point. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary, and x as a tiny circle outside of z but touching y's boundary exactly at the point where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other.
   From EC(x,y), we know x touches y only at their boundaries. From TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z. For x to partially overlap with z, it must have a part inside z and a part outside z. This is possible if x touches y at y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of z. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary, and x as a shape that touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), it's possible for x to be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary, either directly or at the point where y touches z's boundary. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary, and x as a tiny circle inside z that touches both y's boundary and z's boundary.

   Wait, I think I see a potential issue. For TPP(x,z) to hold, x needs to be completely inside z. But from EC(x,y), x only touches y at their boundaries. This means x can't be "inside" y. But can it be inside z?

   Yes, I believe it can. Imagine z as a big square, y as a smaller rectangle inside z touching z's right boundary, and x as a tiny circle that's inside z, to the left of y, and touches both y's left boundary and z's left boundary. In this scenario, EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) hold, and so does TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), it's possible for x to be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary. Imagine z as a big square, y as a smaller rectangle inside z touching z's right boundary, and x as a tiny circle that's inside z, to the left of y, and touches y's left boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary. In this scenario, EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) hold, and so does NTPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
   Given TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z. Since x only touches y at the boundary (from EC(x,y)), it's not possible for z to be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   For similar reasons as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region.
   Given the constraints, this is not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at the boundary. So x and z can't be the same region.

In summary, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

However, I'm still uncertain about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let me think a bit more about these.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's be more systematic and consider if the following is a consistent scenario for TPP(x,z):

z is a big square. y is a smaller square inside z, touching z's boundary at the top. x is an even smaller square inside z, positioned to the right of y. x touches y's right boundary and z's right boundary.

In this scenario:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. ✓
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. ✓
- TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. ✓

So, it seems TPP(x,z) is possible.

Now, for NTPP(x,z):

z is a big square. y is a smaller square inside z, touching z's boundary at the top. x is an even smaller square inside z, positioned to the right of y. x touches y's right boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary.

In this scenario:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. ✓
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. ✓
- NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. ✓

So, it seems NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

To be thorough, let's also check the other relations:

For DC(x,z):

z is a big square. y is a smaller square inside z, touching z's boundary at the top. x is a square outside of z, but it touches y's right boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary.

In this scenario:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. ✓
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. ✓
- DC(x,z): x and z don't touch and share no parts. ✓

So, DC(x,z) is possible.

For EC(x,z):

z is a big square. y is a smaller square inside z, touching z's boundary at the top. x is a square outside of z, but it touches y's top boundary at the point where y touches z's boundary.

In this scenario:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. ✓
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. ✓
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. ✓

So, EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z):

z is a big square. y is a smaller square inside z, touching z's boundary at the top. x is a rectangle that touches y's top boundary and extends both inside and outside of z.

In this scenario:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. ✓
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. ✓
- PO(x,z): x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other. ✓

So, PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x):

This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z. Since x only touches y at the boundary (from EC(x,y)), it's not possible for z to be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x):

This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For similar reasons as above, this is not possible.

For EQ(x,z):

This would mean x and z are the same region. Given the constraints, this is not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at the boundary. So x and z can't be the same region.

In summary, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

I've verified each of these with concrete examples, and I'm now confident in this answer.

Actually, let me double-check each of these possible relations to ensure they are truly consistent with the given constraints EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   - EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
   - TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
   - For DC(x,z), x and z should not touch and share no parts.

   If x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is completely outside of z, then DC(x,z) can hold. This is consistent.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts:
   - EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
   - TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
   - For EC(x,z), x and z should touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.

   If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x can indirectly touch z's boundary, making EC(x,z) possible. This is consistent.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other:
   - EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
   - TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
   - For PO(x,z), x and z should share some interior parts, but neither should be a part of the other.

   If x touches y at their boundaries and extends both inside and outside of z, then PO(x,z) can hold. This is consistent.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   - EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
   - TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
   - For TPP(x,z), x should be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary.

   I've already described a scenario where x is entirely inside z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary. This is consistent.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   - EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
   - TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
   - For NTPP(x,z), x should be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary.

   I've already described a scenario where x is entirely inside z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is consistent.

The other relations (TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are not possible, as previously discussed.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

However, I just realized that I still need to double check to make sure these examples are truely consistent.

DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected. For this to be true, there needs to be a gap between x and z. But we also have EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So x touches y's boundary, y is inside z, and y touches z's boundary. Can x and z still have a gap in this case? Yes. If x touches y at a point of y's boundary that is not at z's boundary, then x doesn't need to touch z. So DC(x,z) is consistent.

EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. We've established that if x touches y at a point where y touches z, then x and z touch at that point. This is consistent.

PO(x,z) - x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other. If x touches y's boundary but extends both inside and outside of z, then x partially overlaps with z. This is consistent.

TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z. If x touches y's boundary, is completely inside z, and touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z. This is consistent.

NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x touches y's boundary, is completely inside z, and doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is consistent.

So, after a thorough analysis, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,z) - x and z share some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other.
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x remains entirely outside z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, making x and z externally connected at that same point.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of z, creating a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary, is completely inside z, and also touches z's boundary at some point.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x touches y's boundary, is completely inside z, but doesn't touch z's boundary anywhere.

The remaining relations (TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ) are not possible given the constraints.
