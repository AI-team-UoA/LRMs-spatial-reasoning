PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step-by-step. 

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same region.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), this means that y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent. So z has exactly the same spatial properties as y. 

Since PO(x,y), and z is identical to y (because EQ(y,z)), this means that x must have the same relationship with z as it does with y. 

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- PO(x,y) means x and y share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are exactly the same region.
- If y and z are exactly the same region, then x must share some spatial part with z (since it shares a part with y), and neither x is part of z nor z is part of x (since neither x is part of y nor y is part of x).

So the answer is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly by considering the definitions precisely:

- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some interior parts, but neither is part of the other)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Given these definitions, if y and z occupy exactly the same space (EQ(y,z)), and x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), then x must also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way. So the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

This can be seen as a form of substitution: if y and z are equal, then any relationship involving y can be rewritten with z instead.

So the answer is that x and z have the relation PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relationship between x and z follows from the given conditions.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent, any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if PO(x,y) and y is spatially identical to z, then x must have the same relationship with z as it does with y.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
