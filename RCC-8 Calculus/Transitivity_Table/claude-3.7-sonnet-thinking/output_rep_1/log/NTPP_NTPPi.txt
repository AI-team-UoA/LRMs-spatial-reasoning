PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this step by step:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), meaning NTPP(z,y). So z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So we have:
- x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)

Now I need to determine what relation(s) can hold between x and z. Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations and see which ones are consistent with the given conditions:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
   This is possible if x and z are completely separate regions within y. They don't overlap or touch.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected
   This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
   This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries while both being completely within y.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
   This is possible if x and z share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
   This is possible if z contains x and x touches z's boundary, while both are inside y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This means x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.
   This is possible if z completely contains x, and both are inside y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
   This is possible if x contains z and z touches x's boundary, while both are inside y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This means z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
   This is possible if x completely contains z, and both are inside y.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are identical
   This is possible if x and z occupy exactly the same region within y.

So, in theory, it seems all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

But wait, I need to be more careful. Let me think again more carefully about the constraints.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary

Now let's reconsider each relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if x and z are separate regions within y.

2. EC(x,z): Possible if x and z touch at their boundaries while both being completely within y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if x and z partially overlap within y.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, x wouldn't touch y's boundary either. So this is consistent.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. Since z is completely inside y, x would also be completely inside y. So this is consistent.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, z wouldn't touch y's boundary either. So this is consistent.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. Since x is completely inside y, z would also be completely inside y. So this is consistent.

8. EQ(x,z): If x equals z, then both are completely inside y. This is consistent.

So all eight relations appear to be logically possible given just the constraints NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

But wait, I just realized I made an error. The original condition wasn't NTPP(z,y), but rather NTPPi(y,z). Let me correct this:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), so y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary

So we have:
- x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary)

This changes the situation significantly. Let's reconsider:

If x is completely inside y, and y is completely inside z, then by transitivity, x must be completely inside z. The question is whether x touches z's boundary or not.

Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, x must be separated from z's boundary by at least the "buffer" of y. This means x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me double-check this:

Given NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we have:
- x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary

Let's consider each RCC-8 relation again:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since x is inside y and y is inside z, x must be inside z, so they can't be disconnected. Not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z. But since x is completely inside y and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), x must be separated from z's boundary. Not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since x is completely inside y and y is completely inside z, x must be completely inside z, not just partially overlapping. Not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But as explained above, since x is inside y and y doesn't touch z's boundary, x can't touch z's boundary. Not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This is consistent with the given conditions. Possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But z contains y which contains x, so z cannot be inside x. Not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. But z contains y which contains x, so z cannot be inside x. Not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x equals z. But x is inside y and y is inside z, so x must be smaller than z. Not possible.

So the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning once more to be absolutely sure.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

So we have:
- x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary

From these conditions, we can deduce that x must be completely inside z. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is inside y without touching y's boundary, x must be separated from z's boundary by at least the region of y that forms a "buffer" between x and the boundary of y. This means x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z), meaning x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z based on the given information.

From NTPP(x,y), I know that x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.

From NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), I know that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Putting these together:
- x is completely inside y
- y is completely inside z
- Neither x touches y's boundary, nor does y touch z's boundary

By transitivity, x must be completely inside z. Moreover, since y forms a "buffer" between x and z's boundary (as y doesn't touch z's boundary and x doesn't touch y's boundary), x cannot possibly touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z) - x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
