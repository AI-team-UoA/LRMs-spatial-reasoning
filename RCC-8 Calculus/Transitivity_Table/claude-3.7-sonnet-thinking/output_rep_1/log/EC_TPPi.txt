PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the given relations:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning z is part of y (TPP(z,y)) and z touches y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let me go through each possible relation and see which ones are consistent with the given information:

1. DC(x,z): Are x and z disconnected? 
Since x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and z is part of y (TPPi(y,z)), it's possible that x and z have no intersection if z is part of y but does not touch the boundary of y where x touches it. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Do x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts?
Since x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and z is part of y (TPPi(y,z)), it's possible that z touches y's boundary exactly where x touches it. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Do x and z share a part, but neither is fully part of the other?
Since EC(x,y), x and y share no interior parts. Since z is part of y (TPPi(y,z)), and x and y have no interior overlap, x and z also cannot have interior overlap. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Is x a tangential proper part of z?
Given EC(x,y), x is outside of y except for the boundary touch. Since z is part of y (TPPi(y,z)), it's not possible for x to be part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is x a non-tangential proper part of z?
Given EC(x,y), x is outside of y except for the boundary touch. Since z is part of y (TPPi(y,z)), it's not possible for x to be part of z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is z a tangential proper part of x?
Given EC(x,y), x is outside of y except for the boundary touch. Since z is part of y (TPPi(y,z)), z is inside y. It's possible that z touches the boundary of y exactly where x touches it, and z is completely contained within x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is z a non-tangential proper part of x?
Given EC(x,y), x is outside of y except for the boundary touch. Since z is part of y (TPPi(y,z)), z is inside y. It's possible that z doesn't touch the boundary of y where x touches it, but still z is completely contained within x. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

Oh wait, I think I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me clarify something first.

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, or equivalently, TPP(z,y). That means z is NOT part of y, but rather y is part of z. Sorry for the confusion.

So with TPPi(y,z), y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let me redo the analysis:

1. DC(x,z): Are x and z disconnected?
Since x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and y is part of z (TPPi(y,z)), it's possible that z extends beyond y in a way that doesn't touch x. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Do x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior parts?
Since x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and y is part of z (TPPi(y,z)), it's possible that z extends up to but not beyond the boundary it shares with x. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Do x and z share a part, but neither is fully part of the other?
Since EC(x,y), x and y share no interior parts, only a boundary. Since y is part of z (TPPi(y,z)), z can extend beyond y. If z extends into x, then x and z could have an overlapping region. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

Oh wait, let me double-check this. If EC(x,y), then x and y don't share any interior parts, only a boundary. If y is part of z (TPPi(y,z)), then z includes all of y. If z extends beyond y into x's interior, then y and x would need to share interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,y). So PO(x,z) is not possible.

But let's be even more careful. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. TPPi(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary. So z contains all of y, and y touches the boundary of z. 

Since EC(x,y), x touches the boundary of y. And since y touches the boundary of z (because TPPi(y,z)), it's possible that the boundary of x is touching the boundary of z at the same place where x touches y. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

But z could also extend beyond y in a way that it doesn't touch x, making DC(x,z) a possibility.

Or z could extend beyond y in a way that it overlaps with x, making PO(x,z) a possibility.

But hold on. If EC(x,y), then x and y share a boundary, not interior parts. If z extends beyond y into x, that would mean there's a part of z (the part that's in x) that's not in y, which is fine. But for x and z to have a partial overlap (PO), they need to share an interior part, and x and z would both need to have parts not shared with the other. If x and y don't share interior parts (EC(x,y)), and y is part of z (TPPi(y,z)), then any overlap between x and z would need to be outside of y. But if there's a part of x that's inside z but outside of y, then x and y can't be EC because there would be a part of x that's inside y.

Hmm, let me reconsider. I think I need to be more clear about the spatial implications.

EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, or equivalently, TPP(z,y). This means that y is part of z and y touches the boundary of z.

Given these, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since y is part of z (TPPi(y,z)), z contains all of y. And since y touches z's boundary (TPPi(y,z)), there's at least one point on the boundary of y that's also on the boundary of z.

Since x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), there's at least one point on the boundary of y that's also on the boundary of x.

Now, there are several ways z could be positioned relative to x:

1. DC(x,z): z could completely contain y, and the boundary of z does not intersect with the boundary of x. In this case, x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): z could completely contain y, and the boundary of z intersects with the boundary of x exactly at the points where x touches y. In this case, x and z touch but do not overlap.

3. PO(x,z): z could extend beyond y in a way that it overlaps with x. This would mean that a part of z is in x, and a part of x is not in z. But for this to happen, z would need to overlap with x, which contradicts EC(x,y) since y is part of z. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me reconsider. If y is part of z, and z extends beyond y into x, that means there's a part of z that's in x. But EC(x,y) only says that x and y touch at a boundary; it doesn't say anything about x and z. So it's possible that x and z have an overlap, making PO(x,z) a possibility.

Actually, wait, I need to be more careful here. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. So the interiors of x and y are disjoint. If y is part of z (TPPi(y,z)), then the interior of y is part of the interior of z. That means the interior of z contains the interior of y. 

Since the interiors of x and y are disjoint, and the interior of y is part of the interior of z, it follows that the interior of x and the part of the interior of z that is the interior of y are disjoint.

But z can extend beyond y, and the part of z that is not part of y could potentially overlap with x. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely contained within z and touch the boundary of z. But if EC(x,y), then x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. If y is part of z (TPPi(y,z)), and x were a part of z, then x would need to share interior parts with y (since both are part of z), which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I'm still not being careful enough. If x is completely contained in z, that doesn't necessarily mean x and y share interior parts. Let's look at it differently.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's approach it differently.

If y is a proper part of z (TPPi(y,z)), then z contains all of y and more. Since x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), x is mostly outside of y. Now, depending on how z extends beyond y, x and z could have different relationships.

If z extends beyond y into x, then x and z would have a partial overlap (PO). And I don't think this contradicts EC(x,y), because the overlap is in the part of z that's not part of y.

If z extends beyond y but does not intersect with x, then x and z could be disconnected (DC) or just touching at a boundary (EC), depending on whether the boundaries of x and z coincide at any point.

Actually, maybe I'm not considering the tangential part of TPPi(y,z) enough. If y touches the boundary of z, and x touches the boundary of y, then it's possible that x also touches the boundary of z at the same point. In this case, EC(x,z) would hold. But if x touches y at a different part of y's boundary than where y touches z's boundary, then DC(x,z) would hold.

So, the possible relationships between x and z could be DC, EC, or PO, depending on how z extends beyond y and whether the boundaries coincide.

Let me try once more, carefully.

EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. So boundary(x) ∩ boundary(y) ≠ ∅, but interior(x) ∩ interior(y) = ∅.

TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. So y ⊂ z, y ≠ z, and boundary(y) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.

Now, I want to know the possible relationships between x and z.

The possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Let's see which of these are consistent with the given information:

1. DC(x,z): For x and z to be disconnected, x ∩ z = ∅. But we know y is part of z, and x touches y, so if z is exactly the same as y, then x would at least touch z. However, if z extends beyond y in the opposite direction from x, then it's possible for x and z to be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible if boundary(x) ∩ boundary(y) ≠ boundary(y) ∩ boundary(z).

Wait, that's not right. If x touches y and y is part of z, x might still not touch z. For example, imagine y is a circle, z is a larger circle that contains y and touches the boundary of y only at the far end, and x is another circle that touches y at the near end. Then x and z would be DC.

So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): For x and z to be externally connected, x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. If x touches y at exactly the same point where y touches the boundary of z, then x would also touch z. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, they need to share a part, but neither is part of the other. If z extends beyond y into x, then x and z would have a partial overlap. But is this possible given EC(x,y)?

If x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts, and y is part of z, it doesn't necessarily mean x and z can't overlap. Z could extend beyond y in a way that it overlaps with x. So PO(x,z) is possible.

Actually, wait. If EC(x,y), then the interior of x and the interior of y are disjoint. If y is part of z, then the interior of y is part of the interior of z. So at least a part of the interior of z (the part that's the interior of y) is disjoint from the interior of x. But z can extend beyond y, and that part of z might overlap with the interior of x. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely contained within z and touch the boundary of z. But we know EC(x,y), which means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. If y is part of z, and x were completely contained within z, then at least part of x would need to be in the part of z that's not part of y (since x and y don't share interior parts). But then x would need to be connected to that part of z, which means x would need to cross the boundary of y, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely contained within z and not touch the boundary of z. For the same reason as TPP(x,z), this is not possible given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely contained within x and touch the boundary of x. But we know TPPi(y,z), which means y is part of z. If z were completely contained within x, then y would also be completely contained within x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely contained within x and not touch the boundary of x. For the same reason as TPPi(x,z), this is not possible given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For x to be equal to z, x and z would need to be the same. But we know EC(x,y), which means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts, and TPPi(y,z), which means y is part of z. If x were the same as z, then y would be part of x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, and PO.

Let's reason once more to check. 

EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z. By "proper part", I mean y is a part of z but not equal to z.

Now let's check which of the 8 RCC relations are possible for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? Well, if y touches the boundary of z at a place that's far from where x touches y, then z might not touch x at all. For example, if y is a circle, z is a larger circle that contains y and touches y only at the far right, and x is another circle that touches y only at the far left, then x and z would be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be externally connected? Yes, if x touches the boundary of y at the exact same place where y touches the boundary of z. In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap? This is a bit tricky. For x and z to partially overlap, they need to share an interior part, but neither is part of the other. Given EC(x,y), x and y don't share interior parts. And given TPPi(y,z), y is part of z. If z extends beyond y in a way that it includes part of x, then x and z would have a partial overlap. But is this possible given EC(x,y)?

Actually, I was mistaken earlier. Since EC(x,y), the interiors of x and y are disjoint. So, if y is part of z, then z would include the entire interior of y, which is already disjoint from the interior of x. The only way x and z could overlap is if z extends beyond y into x in a way that z shares an interior part with x. But given EC(x,y), the only connection between x and y is at the boundary, not in the interior. So, z can't extend from y into the interior of x without crossing a boundary, which would violate the condition that EC(x,y). Thus, PO(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me reconsider. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means x ∩ y ≠ ∅, interior(x) ∩ interior(y) = ∅, and x ∩ y ⊆ boundary(x) ∪ boundary(y).

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y ⊂ z, y ≠ z, and boundary(y) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.

For PO(x,z) to hold, we need interior(x) ∩ interior(z) ≠ ∅, and neither x ⊆ z nor z ⊆ x. Given that y ⊂ z, z contains the entire y. Since y ⊆ z, we have interior(y) ⊆ interior(z) (the interior of a part is part of the interior of the whole). Since interior(x) ∩ interior(y) = ∅, the part of interior(z) that is interior(y) does not overlap with interior(x). But z might extend beyond y into x, and then interior(x) ∩ interior(z) might be non-empty, making PO(x,z) possible.

But hold on. If z extends beyond y into x, it would mean that there's a part of z that's in x. But EC(x,y) means x and y only share boundary points, not interior points. So, if z extends from y into x, it would need to do so through a boundary point of y. But then, within x, this extension would need to immediately become an interior point of z (since it's not part of y), and to be in PO relation, it would also need to be an interior point of x. But this feels problematic because it would mean that there's a point in the interior of x that's also in the interior of z, but this point is on the boundary of y, which is a contradiction because the boundary of y can't be in the interior of x.

Actually, wait, I think I'm making a mistake. The boundary of y can certainly be in the interior of x. For instance, consider a circle x with a smaller circle y inside touching its boundary from within.

Let me reconsider. It's still a bit tricky.

The problem with the PO(x,z) relation is that we need to ensure that interior(x) ∩ interior(z) ≠ ∅. But given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), it's unclear whether this is possible.

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y ⊂ z, y ≠ z, and boundary(y) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅. So, z contains all of y and extends beyond it, and they touch at a boundary.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. So, interior(x) ∩ interior(y) = ∅.

Now, if z extends beyond y into x, it might overlap with the interior of x. But is this possible given EC(x,y)?

Let's consider a different example. Imagine y is a circle, x is another circle that touches y only at the far left, and z is a larger blob that entirely contains y and also extends to encompass a part of x. In this case, EC(x,y) holds, TPPi(y,z) holds, and x and z have a partial overlap. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

So, let's double-check our reasoning for all 8 RCC relations for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if z doesn't overlap with x.
2. EC(x,z): Possible if z touches x only at the boundary.
3. PO(x,z): Possible if z overlaps with x, as long as neither is a part of the other.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely contained within z and touch the boundary of z. But if EC(x,y) and y is part of z, it's hard to visualize how x could be a proper part of z without contradicting the EC(x,y) relation. Let's think about it: if x is a tangential proper part of z, then x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅. And if TPPi(y,z), then y ⊂ z. But if x ⊂ z and y ⊂ z, then both x and y are contained in z. For EC(x,y) to hold, x and y should touch at the boundary, not share interior parts. It's hard to see how both x and y can be in z and touch only at a boundary unless they are both tangential to each other inside z. But TPPi(y,z) means y touches the boundary of z, so y is at the edge of z. If x is also in z, it would be deeper inside z or at another edge. That doesn't lend itself to x and y being EC. So, TPP(x,z) is likely not possible.

Let me try to be more precise. EC(x,y) means boundary(x) ∩ boundary(y) ≠ ∅ and interior(x) ∩ interior(y) = ∅. If TPP(x,z), then x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅. And if TPPi(y,z), then y ⊂ z, y ≠ z, and boundary(y) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.

So, both x and y are in z and touch the boundary of z. But for EC(x,y), they also need to touch each other (which is okay) but not share any interior parts. The issue is: if both x and y touch the boundary of z, they might be on opposite sides of z, making it hard for them to be EC. But, on further reflection, it's theoretically possible to position them in a way that they both touch the boundary of z and also touch each other, without sharing interior parts. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I don't think my reasoning is correct. Let me try a more formal approach.

TPP(x,z) means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.

If EC(x,y), then boundary(x) ∩ boundary(y) ≠ ∅ and interior(x) ∩ interior(y) = ∅. 

If TPPi(y,z), then y ⊂ z, y ≠ z, and boundary(y) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.

If x is a tangential proper part of z, then the entire x, including its interior, is inside z. But if y is also inside z and EC(x,y), then x and y only touch at a boundary, not in the interior. This is perfectly possible. For example, consider a rectangle z, with two smaller rectangles x and y inside it. x and y touch at one edge, and they both touch the boundary of z. In this case, TPP(x,z), TPPi(y,z), and EC(x,y) all hold.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely contained within z and not touch the boundary of z. This means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) = ∅. If TPPi(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. Now, can x be completely contained within z, away from its boundary, and still have EC(x,y)?

If x is completely inside z and away from its boundary, and y is also inside z but touches its boundary, then x and y might be EC. For example, consider a large circle z, with two smaller circles x and y inside it. y touches the boundary of z, and x touches the boundary of y but is away from the boundary of z. In this case, NTPP(x,z), TPPi(y,z), and EC(x,y) all hold.

So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely contained within x and touch the boundary of x. This means z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and boundary(z) ∩ boundary(x) ≠ ∅. But if TPPi(y,z), then y ⊂ z. This means y ⊂ x, i.e., y is completely contained within x. But if EC(x,y), then x and y only touch at a boundary, they don't share interior parts. This contradicts the fact that y is completely contained within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely contained within x and not touch the boundary of x. This means z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and boundary(z) ∩ boundary(x) = ∅. But if TPPi(y,z), then y ⊂ z. This means y ⊂ x, i.e., y is completely contained within x. But if EC(x,y), then x and y only touch at a boundary, they don't share interior parts. This contradicts the fact that y is completely contained within x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For x to be equal to z, x and z would need to be the same. This means x = z. But if TPPi(y,z), then y ⊂ z. This means y ⊂ x, i.e., y is completely contained within x. But if EC(x,y), then x and y only touch at a boundary, they don't share interior parts. This contradicts the fact that y is completely contained within x. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, to summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let me reason it through once more for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.

For EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means boundary(x) ∩ boundary(y) ≠ ∅ and interior(x) ∩ interior(y) = ∅.

For TPPi(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y ⊂ z, y ≠ z, and boundary(y) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.

If x is a part of z and y is a part of z, they can still touch only at a boundary (for EC(x,y)). For instance, imagine a square z with two non-overlapping smaller squares x and y inside it, where x and y touch at a corner or edge. Both x and y can touch the boundary of z as well. So, TPP(x,z) is consistent with EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

But wait, I think I'm missing something.

Actually, I missed a crucial fact. EC(x,y) implies that interior(x) ∩ y = ∅ and interior(y) ∩ x = ∅. 

So, EC(x,y) means that neither x nor y has any interior part in the other. It's only the boundaries that touch.

Now, if TPP(x,z), then x ⊂ z. If TPPi(y,z), then y ⊂ z. So, both x and y are parts of z. But given EC(x,y), the only way x and y can interact is by touch at the boundary. It's not clear to me now if x and y can both be parts of z while being EC. Let me think of a concrete counterexample.

Actually, I think I was overthinking. Let's simplify. 

Consider a big rectangle z. Inside z, on its left edge, place a smaller rectangle y that touches the left edge of z. Next, also inside z, place another smaller rectangle x that touches the right edge of y, but doesn't overlap with y. The right edge of x touches the right edge of z.

In this scenario:
- x and y touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts, so EC(x,y).
- y is inside z and touches the boundary of z, so TPPi(y,z).
- x is inside z and touches the boundary of z, so TPP(x,z).

This shows that TPP(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), we can imagine the same big rectangle z. Inside z, on its left edge, place a smaller rectangle y that touches the left edge of z. Next, also inside z but away from its boundary, place another smaller rectangle x that touches the right edge of y, but doesn't overlap with y.

In this scenario:
- x and y touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts, so EC(x,y).
- y is inside z and touches the boundary of z, so TPPi(y,z).
- x is inside z and does not touch the boundary of z, so NTPP(x,z).

This shows that NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, I think I might be mistaken about PO(x,z).

For PO(x,z), x and z need to have a non-empty interior overlap, and neither is a part of the other. This means interior(x) ∩ interior(z) ≠ ∅, x ⊄ z, and z ⊄ x.

I'll again use a concrete example. Imagine a circle y, and another circle x that touches y at a point. Now, consider a blob z that completely encompasses y (such that y is a part of z) and also partially overlaps with x. In this case, EC(x,y) holds because x and y touch at a point, TPPi(y,z) holds because y is a part of z and touches the boundary of z, and PO(x,z) holds because x and z have a non-empty interior overlap but neither is a part of the other.

So, PO(x,z) is possible.

Now, I'll try once more for TPPi(x,z):

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and boundary(z) ∩ boundary(x) ≠ ∅.

If TPPi(y,z), then y ⊂ z. This means y ⊂ x. But if EC(x,y), then x and y only touch at a boundary, which contradicts the fact that y is a proper part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let's be one more time sure that I got all of these right. 

Let's check again:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Possible, as we reasoned earlier.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts. Possible, as we reasoned earlier.
- PO(x,z): x and z have a non-empty interior overlap, but neither is a part of the other. Possible, as we reasoned earlier.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. Possible, as we reasoned earlier.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Possible, as we reasoned earlier.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. Not possible, as we reasoned earlier.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Not possible, as we reasoned earlier.
- EQ(x,z): x is equal to z. Not possible, as we reasoned earlier.

Let's just quickly recheck our example for TPP(x,z) to ensure it's consistent with EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z):

We had a big rectangle z. Inside z, on its left edge, we placed a smaller rectangle y that touches the left edge of z. Next, also inside z, we placed another smaller rectangle x that touches the right edge of y, but doesn't overlap with y. The right edge of x touches the right edge of z.

Let's recheck:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts. This holds in our example because the right edge of y touches the left edge of x, and they do not share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This holds in our example because y is inside z and touches the left edge of z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This holds in our example because x is inside z and touches the right edge of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

And similarly, using the same example but placing x in the middle of z (not touching the boundary of z), we can verify that NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

Now, let's recheck PO(x,z):

For PO(x,z), x and z need to have a non-empty interior overlap, and neither is a part of the other.

We reasoned with a concrete example: a circle y, another circle x that touches y at a point, and a blob z that completely encompasses y and also partially overlaps with x. Let's recheck:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a point. This holds in our example.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This holds because y is inside z and touches the boundary of z.
- PO(x,z): x and z have a non-empty interior overlap, but neither is a part of the other. This holds in our example because z partially overlaps with x.

So, PO(x,z) is also possible.

Let me recheck the conditions on EC, PO, and DC to see if I might have made a mistake:

EC(x,y) means x ∩ y ≠ ∅, but interior(x) ∩ interior(y) = ∅.
PO(x,z) means interior(x) ∩ interior(z) ≠ ∅, x ⊄ z, and z ⊄ x.
DC(x,z) means x ∩ z = ∅.

Now, if interior(x) ∩ interior(y) = ∅ and y ⊂ z, then interior(y) ⊂ interior(z). So, the part of the interior of z that is the interior of y doesn't overlap with the interior of x. But z might have other parts of interior that overlap with the interior of x, which is where the PO relation comes from. So, PO(x,z) is still possible.

Also, if x ∩ y is only on the boundary and not in the interior, and y ⊂ z, then x might not intersect with the part of z that is y. But x might still intersect with the part of z that is not y. So, DC(x,z) is also still possible.

Let me re-check TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) once more for confirmation.

TPP(x,z) means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.
NTPP(x,z) means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) = ∅.

For both of these, x is completely inside z. But EC(x,y) means x and y only touch at a boundary and do not share interior parts. If y ⊂ z (from TPPi(y,z)), and x ⊂ z, then both x and y are inside z. The question is: can x and y be inside z and still satisfy EC(x,y)?

I claim they can. For instance, consider z as a rectangle and both x and y as smaller rectangles inside z, where x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This satisfies EC(x,y). And if y touches the boundary of z, it satisfies TPPi(y,z). Now, x can either touch the boundary of z (for TPP(x,z)) or not (for NTPP(x,z)). Both scenarios are possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let's just do a final check to make sure we're covering all cases. Consider the formal definitions of the 8 RCC relations:

1. DC(x,z) means x ∩ z = ∅.
2. EC(x,z) means x ∩ z ≠ ∅, interior(x) ∩ interior(z) = ∅.
3. PO(x,z) means interior(x) ∩ interior(z) ≠ ∅, x ⊄ z, z ⊄ x.
4. TPP(x,z) means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.
5. NTPP(x,z) means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) = ∅.
6. TPPi(x,z) means z ⊂ x, x ≠ z, boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.
7. NTPPi(x,z) means z ⊂ x, x ≠ z, boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) = ∅.
8. EQ(x,z) means x = z.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x ∩ y ≠ ∅, interior(x) ∩ interior(y) = ∅.
- TPPi(y,z): y ⊂ z, y ≠ z, boundary(y) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅.

Let's go through each option:

1. DC(x,z): For x and z to be disconnected, x ∩ z = ∅. Is this possible given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z)? I've already reasoned that if x and y touch at a point that's not where y touches the boundary of z, then x and z can be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): For x and z to be externally connected, x ∩ z ≠ ∅ and interior(x) ∩ interior(z) = ∅. I've already reasoned that if x and y touch at the same point where y touches the boundary of z, then x and z can be externally connected. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, interior(x) ∩ interior(z) ≠ ∅, x ⊄ z, and z ⊄ x. I've already reasoned that if z extends beyond y into x, then x and z can have a partial overlap. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅. I've already reasoned that x and y can both be inside z and still satisfy EC(x,y), with x touching the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) = ∅. I've already reasoned that x and y can both be inside z and still satisfy EC(x,y), with x not touching the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) ≠ ∅. I've already reasoned that if z ⊂ x and given that y ⊂ z (from TPPi(y,z)), we'd have y ⊂ x. But this contradicts EC(x,y), which says x and y only touch at a boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and boundary(x) ∩ boundary(z) = ∅. For the same reason as TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For x to be equal to z, x = z. Again, if x = z, then given y ⊂ z (from TPPi(y,z)), we'd have y ⊂ x. But this contradicts EC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, I'm not sure if my reasoning for PO(x,z) is correct. Let's reexamine.

For PO(x,z), x and z need to have a non-empty interior overlap, and neither is a part of the other.

I reasoned that if z extends beyond y into x, then x and z can have a partial overlap. But if EC(x,y), then x and y touch at a boundary and do not share interior parts.

Let's return to our example: a circle y, another circle x that touches y at a point, and a blob z that completely encompasses y and also partially overlaps with x. But if y ⊂ z and x and y touch only at a boundary, how does z extend into the interior of x? The only way they can interact is through the point where x and y touch. And if z extends beyond y at that point, it doesn't make sense.

But actually, let's imagine a different example. Consider a rectangle y, and a rectangle x that shares an edge (no overlap) with y. Now, consider a shape z that includes all of y and also extends a bit into x. In this case, EC(x,y) holds, TPPi(y,z) holds, and PO(x,z) also holds.

But I'm still not convinced. If y ⊂ z, then the boundary of y might be part of the interior of z. But if x touches the boundary of y, and the boundary of y is part of the interior of z, then x might touch the interior of z. In this case, we'll have EC(x,z), not PO(x,z), because the intersection of x and z is just a boundary point.

You know what? Let's draw it out (mentally). 

Imagine a circle y, and a circle x that touches y at a point. Now, consider a shape z that encompasses all of y such that y ⊂ z, and z also extends a bit beyond the boundary of y into x. In this case, a part of x (beyond the point where x and y touch) is inside z, which makes interior(x) ∩ interior(z) ≠ ∅. And since x isn't fully inside z and z isn't fully inside x, we have PO(x,z).

I think my reasoning for PO(x,z) is correct, and it is a possible relationship between x and z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

But let's revisit some of these scenarios. If x touches y at a single point and y ⊂ z, it's not clear to me how TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) can hold. Let's check more carefully.

For TPP(x,z), x would need to be completely inside z and touch the boundary of z. But if x touches y only at a point, how can x be completely inside z? The only way for this to happen is if z extends around x, encompassing it. But this doesn't seem consistent with the constraints.

Let's revisit our example for TPP(x,z): a big rectangle z, and two smaller rectangles x and y inside it, where x and y touch at a boundary. y touches the boundary of z. But for TPP(x,z), x would need to touch the boundary of z as well.

But now that I'm thinking more about it, this is perfectly possible geometrically. Picture a large square z. Inside z, there are two smaller rectangles, y and x, which abut each other (i.e., they share a boundary but don't overlap, so they stand in the EC relation). y touches the boundary of z on one side, and x touches a boundary of z on a different side. Then the situation is as follows:

- EC(x,y) holds because x and y share a boundary but no interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z) holds because y is inside z, not equal to z, and touches the boundary of z.
- TPP(x,z) holds because x is inside z, not equal to z, and touches the boundary of z.

Similarly, using the same example but positioning x so it doesn't touch the boundary of z, we can get NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let's make one final check by revisiting the original relations and our reasoning.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z, not equal to z, and touches the boundary of z.

Let's go through each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't interact at all. It's possible if x touches y at a point that's not where y touches the boundary of z. For example, if y is a circle that touches the boundary of z on the right, and x is another circle that touches y on the left, then x and z will be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. It's possible if x touches y at the same point where y touches the boundary of z. Alternatively, x and y might touch at one point, and x might touch the boundary of z at another point (similar to the example we mentioned earlier with the square z and rectangles x and y inside it).

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. It's possible if z extends beyond y into x. For example, imagine a circle y that touches a circle x at a point, and a shape z that encompasses all of y and also extends a bit into x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z, not equal to z, and touches the boundary of z. Using the example of a square z and two rectangles x and y inside it that touch at a boundary, with both x and y also touching the boundary of z (at different places), this is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Using the same example as above, but placing x so it doesn't touch the boundary of z, this is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x, not equal to x, and touches the boundary of x. But this contradicts TPPi(y,z) because if z is inside x and y is inside z, then y would be inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. For the same reason as TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. But if TPPi(y,z), then y is inside z. If x and z are the same, then y would be inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

So the answer is: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the conditions EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what these conditions tell us:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is contained in z, touches z's boundary, and y ≠ z

Now I'll check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, x and z can be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at the same point where y touches z's boundary, then x and z would touch externally.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. z could extend beyond y in a way that partially overlaps with x.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary. This can occur while maintaining EC(x,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still being EC with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were inside x, and y is inside z (from TPPi(y,z)), then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, and y is inside z, then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).
