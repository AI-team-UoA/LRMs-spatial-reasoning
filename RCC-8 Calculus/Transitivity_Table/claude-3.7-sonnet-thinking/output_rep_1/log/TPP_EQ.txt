PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the relationships that we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, which means they are exactly the same spatial region.

Given that y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), anything that's true about y's spatial relationship with another object is also true about z's spatial relationship with that object.

So if x is part of y and touches y's boundary (TPP(x,y)), and y is coincident with z (EQ(y,z)), then x must also be part of z and touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be TPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y
- x touches y's boundary

EQ(y,z) means:
- y and z are the same region

Given these, it follows that:
- x is a proper part of z (since x is a proper part of y, and y is the same as z)
- x touches z's boundary (since x touches y's boundary, and y is the same as z)

This matches the definition of TPP(x,z).

So the answer is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship must hold between x and z given the information we have.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Since y and z are coincident (exactly the same region), any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. The boundary of y is identical to the boundary of z, and the interior of y is identical to the interior of z.

Therefore, if x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary, x must also be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
