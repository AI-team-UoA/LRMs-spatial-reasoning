PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We are given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

To do this, I'll consider what we know about the spatial relationships and think about which RCC-8 relations are possible for (x,z).

Given that x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), there are parts of x that are in y and parts that are outside of y.

Given that y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), all of y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation for (x,z):

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Can x be completely disconnected from z? 
   Since PO(x,y) means x shares some part with y, and TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, then the part of x that overlaps with y must also be inside z. So x and z must share at least some part, which means they cannot be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Can x touch z at the boundary without sharing interior parts?
   Since PO(x,y) means x shares interior parts with y, and TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, then x must share some interior part with z (via the shared part with y). So EC(x,z) is not possible either.

3. PO(x,z) - Partial overlap: Can x partially overlap with z?
   We know that part of x overlaps with y, which is inside z. Also, part of x is outside y. If this part outside y is also outside z, then x would partially overlap with z. This seems possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Can x be a tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary. This is possible if all the parts of x that are outside y are still inside z, and some part of x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean all of x is inside z and x does not touch z's boundary. This is possible if all of x is contained within the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) - Inverse tangential proper part: Can z be a tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean all of z is inside x and z touches x's boundary. However, we know that y is inside z, and part of x is outside y. Unless all of z happens to be inside the part of x that overlaps with y, this seems unlikely. But actually, TPP(y,z) means y is inside z but z is strictly larger than y. So z extends beyond y. But we know that part of x is outside y. So if z was inside x, then all parts of z that extend beyond y would have to be inside the parts of x that are outside y. This seems like a very specific arrangement and not generally possible given just the constraints PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So I think TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean all of z is inside x and z does not touch x's boundary. Following similar logic as for TPPi, this seems unlikely and not generally possible given the constraints.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Can x be equal to z?
   This would mean x and z are the same region. Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), this is not generally possible because if x and z were the same, we would have PO(x,y) and TPP(y,x), which is not usually consistent.

Let me double-check my reasoning...

Actually, I need to re-examine the possibility of TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me imagine some specific configurations:

For TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x.
If y is a small region inside z, and x envelops almost all of z except for a small part at the boundary, then it's possible that x and y partially overlap (PO(x,y)), y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and z is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)). Actually, no, this doesn't work. If z is a proper part of x, then every part of z is a part of x. But y is part of z, so y would have to be a part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
Following similar logic as for TPPi, this is not possible because it would contradict PO(x,y).

For EQ(x,z) - Equal: I said this wasn't generally possible, but let me reconsider. If x and z are the same, then PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would mean PO(x,y) and TPP(y,x). Can y partially overlap with x and also be a tangential proper part of x? No, these are contradictory relationships. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Now, let me double-check by considering specific examples or arrangements for each of these relationships:

1. PO(x,z) - Partial overlap:
   Imagine x extends partly inside z (specifically, the part that overlaps with y) and partly outside z. This arrangement satisfies both PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

2. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   Imagine x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, while also partially overlapping with y (which is also inside z and touches z's boundary). This arrangement satisfies both PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

3. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   Imagine x is completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, while also partially overlapping with y (which is inside z and touches z's boundary). This arrangement satisfies both PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Based on my analysis, the final possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Actually, wait. I need to double-check if DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) is possible.

For DC(x,z) - Disconnected: 
I previously argued that since PO(x,y) means x shares some part with y, and TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, then the part of x that overlaps with y must also be inside z. So x and z must share at least some part, which means they cannot be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible. This seems correct.

For EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
I argued that since PO(x,y) means x shares interior parts with y, and TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, then x must share some interior part with z (via the shared part with y). So EC(x,z) is not possible. This also seems correct.

So, my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Actually, let me think about EC(x,z) once more.

EC(x,z) would mean that x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. 

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share interior parts.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning all of y is inside z and y touches z's boundary.

The key here is: If part of x overlaps with y, and all of y is inside z, then that part of x must also be inside z. This means x and z share interior parts. Thus, they cannot be EC (which requires no shared interior parts).

So, EC(x,z) is not possible. My final list of possible relationships is correct.

To reiterate, the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some part, but neither is contained in the other)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze which RCC-8 relations are possible for (x,z):

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible because part of x overlaps with y, which is inside z, so x and z must share some region.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible because x shares interior parts with y (due to PO), and y is inside z, so x must share interior parts with z.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible when part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y) and part of x extends outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible when x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary while partially overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible when x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary while partially overlapping with y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible because if z were inside x, then y would be inside x (since y is inside z), contradicting PO(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible because it would create a contradiction with the given relations.
