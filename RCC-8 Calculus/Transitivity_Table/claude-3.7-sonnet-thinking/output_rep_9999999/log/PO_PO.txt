PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem step by step. 

We know that:
- PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

We need to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z. The possible relationships are the RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries)
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal

Let's consider each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and y overlap in one area, and y and z overlap in a completely different area. Then x and z would be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and y overlap in one area, and y and z overlap in an area that is adjacent to x but doesn't overlap with it. Then x and z would be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and y overlap in one area, and y and z overlap in an area that partially overlaps with x. Then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x is mostly contained within y, with a small part of x touching the boundary of y. And imagine that z contains all of y and extends beyond it. Then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x is completely contained within y, not touching the boundary of y. And imagine that z contains all of y and extends beyond it. Then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. Imagine y is mostly contained within x, with a small part of y touching the boundary of x. And imagine that z is contained within that small part of y, with a part of z touching the boundary of y (and hence the boundary of x). Then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. Imagine y is mostly contained within x, with a small part of y touching the boundary of x. And imagine that z is completely contained within y, not touching the boundary of y. Then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This is possible. Imagine y overlaps with both x and z in exactly the same way, and x and z are identical. Then x and z would be equal.

So all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are possible given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let's double check my reasoning for each case with a specific example:

1. DC(x,z): Let's say x is the left half of a square, y is the middle half of the square (overlapping with x on the left quarter of the square), and z is the right half of the square (overlapping with y on the right quarter of the square). Then x and z are disconnected, as they don't share any space or touch at all.

2. EC(x,z): Let's say x is the left half of a square, y is the middle half of the square (overlapping with x on the left quarter of the square), and z is the right half of the square but it extends slightly to the left so that it just touches the right edge of x. Then x and z are externally connected, as they touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): Let's say x is the left half of a square, y is the middle half of the square (overlapping with x on the left quarter of the square), and z overlaps with the right quarter of x and extends to the right. Then x and z partially overlap, as they share a spatial part but neither is part of the other.

4. TPP(x,z): Let's say x is a small square in the middle-left of a larger square, y is the left half of the larger square (so x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y), and z is the entire larger square. Then x is a tangential proper part of z, as x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

Wait, I think I may have made an error. Let's reconsider my understanding of the PO relation. PO(x,y) means that x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. 

Let's try to construct examples again:

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be completely contained in z and touch the boundary of z. If PO(x,y), then x is not completely contained in y, and vice versa. Similarly, if PO(y,z), then y is not completely contained in z, and vice versa. Can x still be completely contained in z? Yes, for example, if x is in the left part of y and z is in the right part of y and also contains all of x.

5. NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be completely contained in z and not touch the boundary of z. Similar to the above case, this is possible if x is in a part of y that is completely contained within z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be completely contained in x and touch the boundary of x. If PO(y,z), then z is not completely contained in y, and vice versa. But can z still be completely contained in x? Yes, for example, if z is in a part of y that is completely contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be completely contained in x and not touch the boundary of x. Similar to the above case, this is possible if z is in a part of y that is completely contained within x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Ok, I think I've convinced myself that all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me draw some examples to make sure I'm not missing anything:

For DC(x,z):
```
x: [    ]
y:    [    ]
z:       [    ]
```
Here, x and y overlap in the middle part of y, and y and z overlap in the right part of y. But x and z are disconnected.

For EC(x,z):
```
x: [    ]
y:    [    ]
z:      [    ]
```
Here, x and y overlap in the middle part of y, and y and z overlap in the right part of y. But x and z are just touching at a point.

For PO(x,z):
```
x: [      ]
y:    [    ]
z:      [    ]
```
Here, x and y overlap in the left part of y, and y and z overlap in the right part of y. But x and z also overlap in the middle part of z.

For TPP(x,z):
```
    z: [        ]
    y:   [    ]
    x:    [ ]
```
Here, x is partially contained in y (touching the boundary of y), and y is partially contained in z. But x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z.

For NTPP(x,z):
```
    z: [        ]
    y:   [    ]
    x:    []
```
Here, x is partially contained in y (not touching the boundary of y), and y is partially contained in z. But x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

For TPPi(x,z):
```
    x: [        ]
    y:   [    ]
    z:     [ ]
```
Here, y is partially contained in x, and z is partially contained in y (touching the boundary of y). But z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z):
```
    x: [        ]
    y:   [    ]
    z:    []
```
Here, y is partially contained in x, and z is partially contained in y (not touching the boundary of y). But z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

For EQ(x,z):
```
    x: [    ]
    y:  []
    z: [    ]
```
Here, y is partially contained in both x and z, and x and z are identical.

So indeed, all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me double check EQ(x,z). For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be coincident, or in other words, exactly the same region. But if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), then x and y share some spatial part but neither is part of the other, and y and z share some spatial part but neither is part of the other.

If x and z are the same region, and both x and z partially overlap with y, then indeed PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) would be true. So EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

So in conclusion, all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me re-consider the TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi cases more carefully.

For TPP(x,z), x must be a proper part of z, which means that x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. 

If PO(x,y), then x and y overlap but neither is completely contained in the other. If PO(y,z), then y and z overlap but neither is completely contained in the other.

Let's consider regions a, b, c, and d such that:
- x = a ∪ b
- y = b ∪ c
- z = c ∪ d

So x and y overlap at b, and y and z overlap at c.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, we need x ⊂ z, which means a ∪ b ⊂ c ∪ d. This is true if a ⊂ c ∪ d and b ⊂ c ∪ d. Since b and c overlap, we know that b ⊂ c ∪ d. But there's no constraint on a that would make a ⊂ c ∪ d. So TPP(x,z) is not generally possible.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me go back to my earlier examples:

For TPP(x,z):
```
    z: [        ]
    y:   [    ]
    x:    [ ]
```

Here, x is partially contained in y (touching the boundary of y), and y is partially contained in z. But x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z.

Actually, I realize the constraint here is not so much about the RCC-8 relations, but about the fact that the regions have to be consistent. Let me draw out the regions more carefully:

Let's say we have regions a, b, c, d, and e such that:
- x = a ∪ b
- y = b ∪ c
- z = c ∪ d ∪ e

We know that PO(x,y), which means that x and y overlap (at b) but neither is completely contained in the other. And we know that PO(y,z), which means that y and z overlap (at c) but neither is completely contained in the other.

Now let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means that x and z are disconnected. But we know that x overlaps with y at b, and y overlaps with z at c. So for x and z to be disconnected, b and c must be disjoint. That is, x = a ∪ b, y = b ∪ c, z = c ∪ d, and b and c are disjoint. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This is possible if, for example, b and c touch at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This means that x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if, for example, b and c overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This means that x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This requires that a ⊂ c ∪ d ∪ e and b ⊂ c ∪ d ∪ e, which can be true if, for example, a ⊂ e and b ⊂ c.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means that x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. This requires that a ⊂ c ∪ d ∪ e and b ⊂ c ∪ d ∪ e, and also that a and b do not touch the boundary of c ∪ d ∪ e. This can be true if, for example, a and b are contained in the interior of e.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means that z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This requires that c ∪ d ∪ e ⊂ a ∪ b, which means that c ⊂ a ∪ b, d ⊂ a ∪ b, and e ⊂ a ∪ b. But we also know that y = b ∪ c and PO(y,z), which means that y and z overlap but neither is completely contained in the other. So c ⊄ c ∪ d ∪ e, which is a contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I've made an error. Let me redefine the regions:

Let's say we have regions a, b, c, d, and e such that:
- x = a ∪ b
- y = b ∪ c
- z = d ∪ e

And we have:
- b ∩ c ≠ ∅ (x and y overlap)
- c ∩ d ≠ ∅ (y and z overlap)

With these definitions, we can see that:
1. DC(x,z): If a, b, and d, e are all disjoint from each other, then x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): If a and d touch at a boundary, then x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,z): If a and d overlap, then x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, we need a ∪ b ⊂ d ∪ e, and (a ∪ b) ∩ (boundary of (d ∪ e)) ≠ ∅. This would require that a ⊂ d ∪ e and b ⊂ d ∪ e, and also that a or b touches the boundary of d ∪ e. But if b ∩ c ≠ ∅ and c ∩ d ≠ ∅, then there's a path from b to d through c. This makes it hard to conceive of a situation where a ∪ b ⊂ d ∪ e.

Actually, I think I'm making this too complicated. Let me think about this in a different way.

If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), then we know that:
- x and y share some region, call it r_xy.
- y and z share some region, call it r_yz.
- Neither x nor y is completely contained in the other.
- Neither y nor z is completely contained in the other.

The question is: what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

The key is to note that r_xy and r_yz are both parts of y, but they might not overlap with each other. If they don't overlap, then the parts of x and z that overlap with y don't overlap with each other. In this case, x and z might be disconnected (DC), or they might touch at a boundary (EC), or they might overlap in some part that doesn't overlap with y (PO).

But if r_xy and r_yz do overlap, then the parts of x and z that overlap with y also overlap with each other. In this case, x and z would share a region, which means they would at least partially overlap (PO).

But we still need to consider the parts of x that don't overlap with y, and the parts of z that don't overlap with y. These parts might lead to various RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's try to construct examples for each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Let x be the left half of a square, y be the middle half of the square, and z be the right half of the square. Then x and y overlap in the middle-left quarter of the square, y and z overlap in the middle-right quarter of the square, but x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Let x be the left half of a square, y be the middle half of the square, and z be the right half of the square, but with z's left boundary exactly touching x's right boundary. Then x and y overlap in the middle-left quarter of the square, y and z overlap in the middle-right quarter of the square, and x and z are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Let x be the left two-thirds of a square, y be the middle third of the square, and z be the right two-thirds of the square. Then x and y overlap in the middle third of the square, y and z overlap in the middle third of the square, and x and z overlap in the middle third of the square as well. But neither x nor z is completely contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): Let x be a small square inside a big square, positioned at the left side of the big square and touching the left boundary of the big square. Let y be the left half of the big square. Let z be the big square. Then x is partially overlapping with y (x is not completely contained in y because it touches the left boundary of the big square, which is outside of y), y is partially overlapping with z (y is not completely contained in z because y includes the left half of the big square, but z includes the entire big square), and x is a tangential proper part of z (x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z).

Hmm, there's something wrong with my TPP example. If x is a small square at the left side of a big square, and y is the left half of the big square, then x is actually completely contained in y, which would make TPP(x,y), not PO(x,y).

Let me try again with TPP(x,z): Let x be a small square inside a big square, positioned in the middle of the big square but extending slightly to the left of the middle. Let y be the middle vertical strip of the big square. Let z be the big square. Then x partially overlaps with y (they share some region, but x extends to the left beyond y), y partially overlaps with z (they share some region, but y doesn't include the left and right parts of the big square), and x is a tangential proper part of z (x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z). Wait, that's still not right, because if x extends to the left of the middle and touches the boundary of the big square, then x would not be completely contained in z.

Maybe TPP(x,z) is not possible. Let's see: If TPP(x,z), then x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. If PO(x,y), then x and y share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other. If PO(y,z), then y and z share some region, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Ah, wait, let me draw it:

Consider a square region:
```
+-------+
|       |
|   y   |
| x   z |
|       |
+-------+
```

Let's say x is the small circle on the left, y is the square in the middle, and z is the small circle on the right and also encompasses the whole square. So:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- TPP(x,z) because x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me take a step back.

If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the most we can say is that x and y overlap at some region r_xy, and y and z overlap at some region r_yz. Without further constraints, r_xy and r_yz can be arbitrary parts of y.

Let's consider a few cases:

1. If r_xy and r_yz are disjoint, then the parts of x and z that overlap with y don't overlap with each other. In this case, x and z might be disconnected (DC), or they might touch at a boundary (EC), or they might overlap in some part that doesn't overlap with y (PO).

2. If r_xy and r_yz overlap, then the parts of x and z that overlap with y also overlap with each other. In this case, x and z would share a region, which means they would at least partially overlap (PO).

But what about the other RCC-8 relations, like TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ?

Let's start with TPP(x,z). This means that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. Is this possible if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)?

Well, if PO(x,y), then x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. Similarly, if PO(y,z), then y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Let me try to construct an example where TPP(x,z) is true.

Let's consider regions x, y, and z such that:
- x is a circle on the left side of the space.
- y is a rectangle in the middle of the space, overlapping partially with x.
- z is the entire space.

Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other (y is not completely contained in z because y is not the entire space).
- TPP(x,z) because x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z.

So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, we can construct examples for NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ:

For NTPP(x,z): Let x be a small circle inside the space, not touching the boundary of the space. Let y be a rectangle in the middle of the space, overlapping partially with x. Let z be the entire space. Then PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPP(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z): Let x be the entire space. Let y be a rectangle in the middle of the space. Let z be a small circle on the right side of the space, overlapping partially with y. Then PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z): Let x be the entire space. Let y be a rectangle in the middle of the space. Let z be a small circle in the middle of the space, completely contained within y and not touching the boundary of y. Then PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

For EQ(x,z): Let x and z be the same circle. Let y be a rectangle that overlaps partially with the circle. Then PO(x,y), PO(y,z), and EQ(x,z).

So all RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, I'm worried that my examples for TPPi and NTPPi are not correct. Let me verify them:

For TPPi(x,z): We have x is the entire space, y is a rectangle in the middle of the space, and z is a small circle on the right side of the space, overlapping partially with y. Then:
- PO(x,y) because y is a part of x, but x is not completely contained in y. Wait, this is not PO, this is TPPi. So this example doesn't work.

Let me try again for TPPi(x,z): Let x be a large circle that encompasses most of the space. Let y be a rectangle that extends from the middle of the space to the outside of the circle. Let z be a small circle that's partially inside y, but is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x. Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z) because z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z): We have x is the entire space, y is a rectangle in the middle of the space, and z is a small circle in the middle of the space, completely contained within y and not touching the boundary of y. But this doesn't work for the same reason as above.

Let me try again for NTPPi(x,z): Let x be a large circle that encompasses most of the space. Let y be a rectangle that extends from the middle of the space to the outside of the circle. Let z be a small circle that's partially inside y, but is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- NTPPi(x,z) because z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Great, so I think I've verified that all RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me double check my example for NTPPi(x,z) one more time. We have:
- x is a large circle that encompasses most of the space.
- y is a rectangle that extends from the middle of the space to the outside of the circle.
- z is a small circle that's partially inside y, but is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

PO(x,y) is true because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.

PO(y,z) is true because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.

NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means that z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is true in our example.

So my example for NTPPi(x,z) is correct.

Actually, I just realized there might be an issue with my example for TPPi(x,z). Let me check it again:

We have:
- x is a large circle that encompasses most of the space.
- y is a rectangle that extends from the middle of the space to the outside of the circle.
- z is a small circle that's partially inside y, but is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x.

PO(x,y) is true because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.

PO(y,z) is true because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, which means that z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. This is true in our example.

So my example for TPPi(x,z) is also correct.

So, in conclusion, all RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, I think there's a problem with my examples for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). I'm saying that z is partially inside y, but this means that z extends outside of y. If z is completely inside x, and z extends outside of y, then y must not cover all of x. But then y is a proper part of x, not a partial overlap.

Let me redo the examples:

For TPPi(x,z): Let x be a large circle. Let y be a rectangle that's partially inside the circle and partially outside. Let z be a small circle that's partially inside y and partially inside the rest of x, and z touches the boundary of x. Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z) because z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z): Let x be a large circle. Let y be a rectangle that's partially inside the circle and partially outside. Let z be a small circle that's partially inside y and partially inside the rest of x, but z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- NTPPi(x,z) because z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

OK actually I don't think my examples for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) quite work. They seem to imply that z overlaps with parts of x that y doesn't overlap with, which isn't quite right.

Let me try again. TPPi(x,z) means that z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. So, we need x to be larger than z, and z to touch the boundary of x. Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) means that z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Actually, I think TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's see. If TPPi(x,z), then z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. If PO(y,z), then y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. So, z is not completely contained in y.

But if z is not completely contained in y, and z is completely contained in x, then y is not completely contained in x. If y is not completely contained in x, and y and x overlap, then PO(x,y).

So it seems like TPPi(x,z) is consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Similarly, if NTPPi(x,z), then z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. If PO(y,z), then y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. So, z is not completely contained in y.

But if z is not completely contained in y, and z is completely contained in x, then y is not completely contained in x. If y is not completely contained in x, and y and x overlap, then PO(x,y).

So it seems like NTPPi(x,z) is also consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me try once more to construct specific examples:

For TPPi(x,z): 
- Let x be a large circle.
- Let y be a smaller circle that's partially inside the large circle and partially outside.
- Let z be a small circle that's inside the intersection of x and y, and z touches the boundary of x.

Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other (z is not completely contained in y because if z touches the boundary of x, it might touch a part of the boundary of x that's inside y, in which case z would be completely inside y).

Actually, this is not working out. Let me try a different approach.

For TPPi(x,z):
- Let x be a large circle centered at the origin.
- Let y be a rectangle with the left side overlapping with the right side of the circle, and the right side extending beyond the circle.
- Let z be a small circle near the right side of the larger circle, partially overlapping with y, and touching the boundary of the larger circle.

Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- TPPi(x,z) because z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- Let x be a large circle centered at the origin.
- Let y be a rectangle with the left side overlapping with the right side of the circle, and the right side extending beyond the circle.
- Let z be a small circle near the right side of the larger circle, partially overlapping with y, but not touching the boundary of the larger circle.

Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- NTPPi(x,z) because z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

OK these examples don't work because y extends outside of x, so PO(y,z) means z must also extend outside of x, which contradicts TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's prove this for TPPi(x,z). If TPPi(x,z), then z is completely contained in x. If PO(y,z), then y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. This means that some part of z is outside of y.

Let's call the part of z that's outside of y as z_out. Since z is completely contained in x, z_out is also completely contained in x. This means that y can't be completely contained in x, because if it were, z would be completely contained in y, which contradicts PO(y,z).

So, some part of y is outside of x. Let's call this part y_out. If PO(x,y), then y and x overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is consistent with y having a part outside of x.

So, TPPi(x,z) is actually consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

The same logic applies to NTPPi(x,z). If NTPPi(x,z), then z is completely contained in x. If PO(y,z), then y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. This means that some part of z is outside of y.

Let's call the part of z that's outside of y as z_out. Since z is completely contained in x, z_out is also completely contained in x. This means that y can't be completely contained in x, because if it were, z would be completely contained in y, which contradicts PO(y,z).

So, some part of y is outside of x. Let's call this part y_out. If PO(x,y), then y and x overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is consistent with y having a part outside of x.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is also consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

But I'm still having trouble coming up with concrete examples.

Actually, let me try one more time for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). I realized the issue with my previous examples is that I was trying to make y and z overlap in a way that wouldn't work.

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), we need z to be completely contained in x. If PO(y,z), then y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other. This means that some part of z is outside of y, and some part of y is outside of z.

For TPPi(x,z):
- Let x be a large circle centered at the origin.
- Let y be a smaller circle that overlaps with the left half of the large circle, with some part of y extending outside of the large circle.
- Let z be a small circle inside the right half of the large circle, touching the boundary of the large circle.

Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- PO(y,z) because... actually, this doesn't work because y and z don't overlap.

OK let me try again. The difficulty here is that if z is completely inside x, and y and z overlap, then y must have some part inside x. But if y also has a part outside of x (which is necessary for PO(x,y)), then y can't be completely inside z. This means that z must also have a part outside of y. But if z is completely inside x, then this part of z outside of y must also be inside x. So y must have a part inside x that doesn't overlap with z. Also, for PO(y,z), y must have a part inside z. So y must have at least two disjoint parts inside x.

Actually, let's try a different kind of shape. I was implicitly assuming that y is connected.

For TPPi(x,z):
- Let x be a square.
- Let y consist of two disjoint circles: one inside the square, and one outside the square.
- Let z be a circle inside the square, partially overlapping with the part of y that's inside the square, and touching the boundary of the square.

Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other (y has a part outside of x).
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other (y has a part outside of z, and z has a part outside of y).
- TPPi(x,z) because z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- Let x be a square.
- Let y consist of two disjoint circles: one inside the square, and one outside the square.
- Let z be a circle inside the square, partially overlapping with the part of y that's inside the square, but not touching the boundary of the square.

Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other (y has a part outside of x).
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other (y has a part outside of z, and z has a part outside of y).
- NTPPi(x,z) because z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

OK, so I think these examples work for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). So all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, wait, I just realized a problem with my examples for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, which means that z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. But this is the same as TPP(z,x). So I should be constructing examples for TPP(z,x), not TPPi(x,z).

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means that z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. But this is the same as NTPP(z,x). So I should be constructing examples for NTPP(z,x), not NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, that's not correct. TPPi is the inverse of TPP. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is completely contained in y and touches the boundary of y. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

So my understanding of TPPi and NTPPi was correct, and I think my examples work.

Actually, I just realized another potential issue with the examples I've been giving for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). I was assuming that y could be a disconnected region, but maybe that's not allowed in the RCC-8 system.

But even if y has to be a connected region, I think TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are still possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
- Let x be a square.
- Let y be a rectangle that extends from the center of the square to outside the square.
- Let z be a small square inside the square, touching the boundary of the square, and partially overlapping with y.

Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other (y has a part outside of x).
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other (y has a part outside of z, and z has a part outside of y).
- TPPi(x,z) because z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- Let x be a square.
- Let y be a rectangle that extends from the center of the square to outside the square.
- Let z be a small square inside the square, not touching the boundary of the square, and partially overlapping with y.

Then:
- PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other (y has a part outside of x).
- PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is completely contained in the other (y has a part outside of z, and z has a part outside of y).
- NTPPi(x,z) because z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

I think these examples work even if y has to be a connected region. So all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So the final answer is: All 8 RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z if PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z when we know that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x overlaps with the left part of y, and z overlaps with the right part of y, with no overlap between them, then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x overlaps with the left part of y, and z overlaps with the right part of y, and they just touch at a boundary, then x and z are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x and z both overlap with the middle part of y, but also extend beyond y in different directions, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. Let x be a small region that partially overlaps with y, let z be a large region that contains x and also partially overlaps with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. Similar to TPP, but with x not touching the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. Let z be a small region that partially overlaps with y, let x be a large region that contains z and also partially overlaps with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. Similar to TPPi, but with z not touching the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. If x and z are the same region, and both partially overlap with y.
