PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step-by-step.

We know that NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). Let's understand what these mean:

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely contained within y, not touching y's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely contained within z, not touching z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since x is completely inside y, and y is completely inside z, this means x is also completely inside z. But we need to determine if x touches z's boundary or not.

Given that x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)), and y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), it follows that x cannot touch z's boundary either. This is because if x were to touch z's boundary, it would have to go through y's boundary first, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Therefore, x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Since x is inside y and y is inside z, then x is inside z.

Now, can x touch z's boundary? If x were to touch z's boundary, it would have to go through y first, and since NTPP(y,z) tells us y doesn't touch z's boundary, x can't touch z's boundary either.

So x is completely inside z without touching the boundary, which is NTPP(x,z).

I'm confident the answer is: NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationship(s) between x and z given that NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), it follows that x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

If x were to touch z's boundary, it would have to extend beyond y's interior, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Therefore, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
