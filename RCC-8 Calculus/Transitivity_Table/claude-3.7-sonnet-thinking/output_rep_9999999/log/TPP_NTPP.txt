PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. We know:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. 

Since TPP(x,y), we know that x is completely inside y, touching y's boundary.
Since NTPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Given these facts, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

First, x must be inside z since x is inside y, and y is inside z.

Now, we need to determine whether x touches the boundary of z or not. 
- Since x touches the boundary of y, and y does not touch the boundary of z, it follows that x cannot touch the boundary of z either. There's no way for x to "reach" the boundary of z if y doesn't touch that boundary.

Therefore, x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning:
- x is inside y and touches y's boundary (TPP(x,y))
- y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z))
- This means x is inside z (since it's inside y which is inside z)
- And x cannot touch z's boundary (since it only touches y's boundary, and y is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary)

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me make sure I've fully understood the definitions:

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is properly inside y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is properly inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

Yes, my reasoning is correct. If x touches the boundary of y, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x cannot touch the boundary of z. Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let me analyze this step by step:

- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary)

Since x is inside y (from TPP(x,y)), and y is completely inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), x must be inside z.

Furthermore, since y does not touch z's boundary, and x is contained within y, there is no way for x to reach z's boundary. Even though x touches y's boundary, y's boundary is entirely within z's interior.

Therefore, x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
