PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1) TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

2) PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Now, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Given:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- y partially overlaps with z

Let's consider the possibilities for x and z:

a) DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Is it possible that x and z don't share any points? No, because y partially overlaps with z, and y is inside x. So x and z must share at least the part where y and z overlap. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

b) EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Is it possible that x and z only touch at their boundaries? This seems unlikely because y (which is inside x) partially overlaps with z, which means that x and z would share some interior points (not just boundary points). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

c) PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Is it possible that x and z partially overlap? Yes, this is a clear possibility. Since y is inside x and y partially overlaps with z, it's quite possible that x and z partially overlap as well.

d) TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x is inside z and touches its boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

e) NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Is it possible that x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary? Similarly to the above, this is possible.

f) TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x? Given the constraints, this is a definite possibility. z could be inside x and touch x's boundary.

g) NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Is it possible that z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary? Again, this is possible.

h) EQ(x,z) - Equal: Is it possible that x and z are the same region? Given the constraints, this seems unlikely. If y is a tangential proper part of x and y partially overlaps with z, then x and z can't be identical. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, on second thought, I'm not sure if some of my reasoning above is correct. Let me double check by visualizing some spatial configurations.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary. In other words, y is a tangential proper part of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

Let's reconsider the possibilities:

a) DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Can x and z be completely separate? No, because y is inside x and y partially overlaps with z, so x and z must share at least that part where y and z overlap. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

b) EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Can x and z touch only at their boundaries? Well, y is inside x and y partially overlaps with z. The part of z that overlaps with y must also be part of x. So x and z share interior points, not just boundary points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

c) PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, this is possible. Given that y is inside x and y partially overlaps with z, it's very likely that x and z would also partially overlap. I'm actually now having a hard time imagining a scenario where PO(x,z) is not the case.

Wait, let me reconsider the other relations more carefully:

d) TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But given that y touches x's boundary (because TPPi(x,y)) and y is not completely inside z (because PO(y,z)), it's hard to see how x could be completely inside z. So I think TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, that's not correct. Let me think again. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then y touches x's boundary from the inside. And if y partially overlaps with z, then part of y is inside z and part of y is outside z. It's possible that the part of y that touches x's boundary is the part that's outside of z. In that case, x could still be completely inside z. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

e) NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary? This is even harder to see than the TPP case. If y touches x's boundary and y is not completely inside z, it's hard to see how x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So I think NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me reconsider. It is possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If the part of y that touches x's boundary is the part that's outside of z, then x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

f) TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y partially overlaps with z and y is a tangential proper part of x, it's possible that z is also a tangential proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

g) NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Can z be completely inside x without touching x's boundary? Again, given the constraints, this is possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

h) EQ(x,z) - Equal: Can x and z be the same region? Given that y is a tangential proper part of x and y partially overlaps with z, it's unlikely that x and z are the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me double-check by thinking about specific configurations.

I think I was reasoning incorrectly above about TPP and NTPP.

Let me reconsider TPP(x,z) - Can x be a tangential proper part of z?

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. If PO(y,z), then y and z share some part, but neither is contained in the other.

Let's say x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. Given that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x, it's possible that the part of the boundary of x that y touches is also part of the boundary of z. In that case, y would touch the boundary of z as well. But since PO(y,z), y is not completely inside z. This creates a contradiction. So I think TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, that's not right. Just because y touches the boundary of x doesn't mean it has to touch the same part of the boundary that x touches with z. y could touch a part of x's boundary that's in the interior of z. So TPP(x,z) is still a possibility.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. The part of y that touches x's boundary could be in the interior of z. So NTPP(x,z) is also a possibility.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x. Given that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that z also touches the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and not touch the boundary of x. Given the constraints, this is possible if the part of z that overlaps with y is entirely in the interior of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But then, given that y is a proper part of x, y would also be a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I feel like I'm getting confused by trying to visualize specific configurations. Let me take a different approach.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

The key insight is that y is inside x, and y partially overlaps with z. This means that z and x must also share some spatial part (at least the part where y and z overlap). But we don't know the full extent of z compared to x.

Let's systematically check each of the 8 RCC-8 relations for x and z:

1) DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is not possible because x and z must share at least the part where y and z overlap.

2) EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This is not possible for the same reason as above. x and z share interior points, not just boundary points.

3) PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This is possible. x and z share some spatial part (where y and z overlap), but it's possible that z extends beyond x in some areas and vice versa.

4) TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Is it possible that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary? Let's think about this. y is inside x and touches x's boundary. y also partially overlaps with z. If the part of y that touches x's boundary is also touching z's boundary, and if the rest of x is inside z, then x would be a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5) NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Is it possible that x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary? Similar to the above, if the part of y that touches x's boundary is well inside z, and the rest of x is also inside z, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6) TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: Is it possible that z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary? Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that z is also inside x and touches x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7) NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Is it possible that z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary? Given the constraints, this is possible if z is entirely in the interior of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8) EQ(x,z) - Equal: Is it possible that x and z are the same region? If x and z are the same, then given that y is a proper part of x, y would also be a proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z partially overlap but neither is a part of the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double check the case of TPP.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z. Given that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x, and y partially overlaps with z, I need to be sure that TPP(x,z) is consistent with these constraints.

If TPP(x,z), then x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. If TPPi(x,y), then y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. This means y is inside z (since x is inside z). But if PO(y,z), then y and z share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other. This contradicts the conclusion that y is inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I've been imprecise above.

Let's use a more careful definition: TPPi(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y, but reversed. So it means that y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x. That is, y is strictly contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x.

And PO(y,z) means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Now, let's reconsider the possibility of TPP(x,z).

If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. If TPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x. This means y is a proper part of z (since x is a proper part of z). But if PO(y,z), then y and z share some part, but neither is a part of the other. This contradicts the conclusion that y is a proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z and not touch the boundary of z. Given the constraints, this would also imply that y is a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x. Given that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that z is also a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. This doesn't contradict any of the given constraints. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and not touch the boundary of x. Given the constraints, this is possible if z is entirely in the interior of x. This doesn't contradict any of the given constraints. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But then, given that y is a proper part of x, y would also be a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, from the RCC-8 relations, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm still a bit uncertain about my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let me carefully think through it again.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z and x would touch the boundary of z. If y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x, and if x is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z share some part, but neither is a part of the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me reconsider. The key insight is that "y is a proper part of x" means that every point in y is also in x, but not vice versa. And "y touches the boundary of x" means that there's at least one point in y that's on the boundary of x.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z and x would touch the boundary of z. If y is a proper part of x, then y is contained entirely within x. Given that x is entirely within z, y is also entirely within z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z share some part, but neither is a part of the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z and not touch the boundary of z. Again, this would imply that y is entirely within z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

For DC(x,z), x and z would be disconnected. But given that y is a part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share at least that part where y and z overlap. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), x and z would only touch at their boundaries. But given that y is a part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share some interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z), x and z would share some spatial part, but neither would be a part of the other. This is consistent with the given constraints. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and z would touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with the given constraints. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and z would not touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with the given constraints. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But then, given that y is a proper part of x, y would also be a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I just realized that in thinking about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), I've been assuming that if y is a proper part of x and x is a proper part of z, then y is a proper part of z. This is correct based on the transitivity of the "part of" relation.

But for PO(y,z), I've been interpreting it as "y and z share some part, but neither is a part of the other." Upon reflection, I think this interpretation is a bit imprecise. A more precise definition is: y and z overlap, and neither is a part of the other.

With this definition, if y is a proper part of x and x is a proper part of z, then y would be a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible, as I concluded.

So, the final answer is: from the RCC-8 relations, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm second-guessing myself again. Let me think of concrete examples to be sure.

Let's define the regions as follows:
- x: A circular region with radius 3 centered at the origin.
- y: A circular region with radius 1 centered at the point (2, 0). Note that y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x at the point (3, 0). So TPPi(x,y) holds.
- z: Let's define z in different ways to test different relationships:

For PO(x,z):
Define z as a circular region with radius 2 centered at the point (2, 2). z overlaps with y, but neither is contained in the other. Also, z overlaps with x, but neither is contained in the other. So PO(y,z) and PO(x,z) both hold.

For TPPi(x,z):
Define z as a circular region with radius 1 centered at the point (2, 1). z overlaps with y, but neither is contained in the other. Also, z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x at the point (3, 1). So PO(y,z) and TPPi(x,z) both hold.

For NTPPi(x,z):
Define z as a circular region with radius 1 centered at the point (1, 1). z overlaps with y, but neither is contained in the other. Also, z is completely inside x and does not touch the boundary of x. So PO(y,z) and NTPPi(x,z) both hold.

Now, let's see if there's a way to have TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z):

For TPP(x,z):
This would mean x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z. But given that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, if x is inside z, then y would also be inside z. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me reconsider. 

For TPP(x,z):
x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z. 
y is inside x and touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
If the point where y touches the boundary of x is also the point where x touches the boundary of z, then y would touch the boundary of z as well. But if y is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z, then y would be a proper part of z. This contradicts PO(y,z).

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This would mean y is also completely inside z (since y is inside x). But this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, the final answer is: the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Ah, I think I've been making an error in my understanding of PO(y,z). Let me be precise.

PO(y,z) means:
1. y and z share some spatial part.
2. There is a part of y that is not a part of z.
3. There is a part of z that is not a part of y.

With this definition, PO(y,z) is not compatible with y being a proper part of z, nor with z being a proper part of y.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z and x would touch the boundary of z. If y is a proper part of x, then y is a proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z, and x would not touch the boundary of z. Again, this would mean y is a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

The remaining possibilities are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, it's best to double-check DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) as well.

For DC(x,z), x and z would be disconnected. But given that y is a part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share at least some spatial part. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), x and z would only touch at their boundaries without sharing any interior points. But given that y is a part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share some interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z), x and z would share some spatial part, but neither would be a part of the other. This is consistent with the given constraints. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and z would touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with the given constraints. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x and z would not touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with the given constraints. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But then, given that y is a proper part of x, y would also be a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the final answer is: the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me try to be even more systematic.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

For each of the 8 RCC-8 relations, I'll check if it's consistent with the given constraints for the relationship between x and z.

1) DC(x,z):
If x and z are disconnected, then they share no spatial part. But y is a part of x, and y shares a spatial part with z. So x and z must share a spatial part. This contradicts DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2) EC(x,z):
If x and z are externally connected, then they touch at their boundaries but share no interior points. But y is a part of x, and y shares a spatial part with z. This shared spatial part includes interior points. So x and z must share interior points. This contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3) PO(x,z):
If x and z partially overlap, then they share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other. Given that y is a part of x, and y shares a spatial part with z, it's consistent that x and z also share a spatial part. And given the other constraints, it's possible that neither x nor z is a part of the other. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4) TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of z. Given that y is a proper part of x, by transitivity, y is a proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5) NTPP(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. Again, by transitivity, y would be a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6) TPPi(x,z):
If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is a proper part of x, and z touches the boundary of x. This is consistent with the given constraints. z could overlap with y, and neither would be a part of the other. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7) NTPPi(x,z):
If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is a proper part of x, and z does not touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with the given constraints. z could overlap with y, and neither would be a part of the other. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8) EQ(x,z):
If x and z are equal, then they are the same region. Given that y is a proper part of x, y would also be a proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me verify once more for PO(x,z). Let's use the full formal definitions for clarity and follow this through one more time.

PO(x,z) means:
1. x and z share some spatial part.
2. There is a part of x that is not a part of z.
3. There is a part of z that is not a part of x.

Checking if PO(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

From PO(y,z), we know that y and z share some spatial part. Since y is a part of x, this shared part is also a part of x. So x and z share some spatial part.

From PO(y,z), we also know that there is a part of y that is not a part of z. Since this part is also a part of x, there is a part of x that is not a part of z.

Finally, from PO(y,z), we know that there is a part of z that is not a part of y. It's possible that this part is also not a part of x. If that's the case, then there is a part of z that is not a part of x.

So, all the conditions for PO(x,z) can be satisfied, given the constraints. Thus, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me briefly verify TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) one more time as well.

TPPi(x,z) means:
1. z is a proper part of x.
2. z touches the boundary of x.

Checking if TPPi(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

If z is a proper part of x, then every point in z is also in x. And if z touches the boundary of x, then there's at least one point in z that's on the boundary of x.

From PO(y,z), we know that y and z share some spatial part, and neither is a part of the other. Specifically, there's a part of z that's not in y, and there's a part of y that's not in z.

These conditions are all compatible. z can be a proper part of x, touch the boundary of x, and still overlap with y without either being a part of the other. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

NTPPi(x,z) means:
1. z is a proper part of x.
2. z does not touch the boundary of x.

Checking if NTPPi(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

If z is a proper part of x, then every point in z is also in x. And if z does not touch the boundary of x, then all points in z are in the interior of x.

From PO(y,z), we know that y and z share some spatial part, and neither is a part of the other. Specifically, there's a part of z that's not in y, and there's a part of y that's not in z.

These conditions are all compatible. z can be a proper part of x, not touch the boundary of x, and still overlap with y without either being a part of the other. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually let me check once more for DC(x,z).

DC(x,z) means:
1. x and z don't share any spatial part.

Checking if DC(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

From PO(y,z), we know that y and z share some spatial part. Since y is a part of x, this shared part is also a part of x. So x and z share some spatial part. This contradicts DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check EC(x,z).

EC(x,z) means:
1. x and z touch at their boundaries.
2. x and z don't share any interior points.

Checking if EC(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

From PO(y,z), we know that y and z share some spatial part. Since y is a part of x, this shared part is also a part of x.

The shared part of y and z must include some interior points, not just boundary points (otherwise, y and z would only touch at their boundaries, which would be EC(y,z), not PO(y,z)). Since these interior points are also in x, x and z share some interior points. This contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Now let me double-check TPP(x,z).

TPP(x,z) means:
1. x is a proper part of z.
2. x touches the boundary of z.

Checking if TPP(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

If x is a proper part of z, then every point in x is also in z. Since y is a proper part of x, every point in y is also in x, and thus in z. This means y is a proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

And let me double-check NTPP(x,z).

NTPP(x,z) means:
1. x is a proper part of z.
2. x does not touch the boundary of z.

Checking if NTPP(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

If x is a proper part of z, then every point in x is also in z. Since y is a proper part of x, every point in y is also in x, and thus in z. This means y is a proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let me check EQ(x,z).

EQ(x,z) means:
1. x and z are the same region.

Checking if EQ(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

If x and z are the same region, then y is a proper part of z (since y is a proper part of x). But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

After checking all 8 RCC-8 relations for consistency with the given constraints, I've determined that the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me perform a direct check by definition one last time:

TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
PO(y,z): y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

DC(x,z): x and z don't share any spatial part.
Given that y is a proper part of x, and y shares a spatial part with z, x must also share a spatial part with z. This contradicts DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries, but don't share any interior points.
Given that y is a proper part of x, and y shares interior points with z, x must also share interior points with z. This contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z): x and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.
This is consistent with y being a proper part of x, and y sharing some spatial part with z, but neither y nor z being a part of the other. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of z.
If x is a proper part of z, then every point in x is also in z. Since y is a proper part of x, y is also a proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and x does not touch the boundary of z.
Similar to TPP(x,z), if x is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x, and z touches the boundary of x.
This is consistent with y being a proper part of x, and y sharing some spatial part with z, but neither y nor z being a part of the other. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x, and z does not touch the boundary of x.
This is consistent with y being a proper part of x, and y sharing some spatial part with z, but neither y nor z being a part of the other. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
If x and z are the same region, then y is a proper part of z (since y is a proper part of x). But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

So my final answer is: PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 spatial relations are possible between x and z, given that TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze what each given relation tells us:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Now I'll check each possible relation between x and z systematically:

1) DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   Not possible. Since y is part of x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share at least the part where y and z overlap.

2) EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   Not possible. Since y is part of x and y shares interior points with z (because of PO), x and z must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3) PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   Possible. x and z can share some spatial part (where y and z overlap), while each having parts the other doesn't contain.

4) TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   Not possible. If x were completely inside z, then y (being inside x) would be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

5) NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   Not possible. For the same reason as TPP - if x were completely inside z, y would be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

6) TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   Possible. z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary, while partially overlapping with y.

7) NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while partially overlapping with y.

8) EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be a proper part of z, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
