PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

In this question, we know that NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z). We need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let me start by recalling the definitions of the relations involved:

- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these relations, let's think about what we know about x, y, and z:
- x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary
- y is inside z and touches z's boundary

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let me go through each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is not possible because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x must also be inside z.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is not possible because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x must also be inside z and cannot just touch z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is not possible because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x must be completely inside z, not partially.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible if x touches the boundary of z. Since y touches the boundary of z, and x is inside y but not touching y's boundary, it's possible for x to touch z's boundary exactly where y touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Since x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is inside z, x could be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so z cannot be inside x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is not possible because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x and z cannot be the same region.

Let me double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z). If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), does this necessarily mean that x could touch the boundary of z?

NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Actually, I need to be careful here. Even though x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, if y touches z's boundary, it's possible for x to also touch z's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary.

But wait, that's not right. If NTPP(x,y), then x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If y touches z's boundary, x is still separated from z's boundary by some part of y (since x doesn't touch y's boundary). So x cannot touch z's boundary, which means TPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

But let me think about this again, because I'm not fully convinced. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these conditions, x must be inside z (because x is inside y, and y is inside z). The question is whether x can touch z's boundary.

Since NTPP(x,y), there is some "buffer" of y between x and y's boundary. TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary, but this doesn't necessarily mean that the entire boundary of y touches the boundary of z. It just means that some part of y's boundary touches z's boundary.

So, x is separated from y's boundary, and only some part of y's boundary touches z's boundary. This means x is separated from z's boundary as well. Therefore, x is completely inside z without touching its boundary, which gives us NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually I'm going to think about this a bit more carefully once more. 

Let's draw a simple diagram mentally:
- z is the largest region
- y is inside z and touches z's boundary at some points
- x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary anywhere

Now, consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. Can x be disconnected from z (DC(x,z))? No, because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x must also be inside z.

2. Can x externally connect with z (EC(x,z))? No, because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x cannot just touch z's boundary; it must be inside z.

3. Can x partially overlap with z (PO(x,z))? No, because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x must be completely inside z, not partially.

4. Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))? If TPP(x,z), then x touches the boundary of z. But NTPP(x,y) means x doesn't touch y's boundary, and TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary. So, for x to touch z's boundary, it would have to first touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))? Yes, this is consistent with the given conditions. x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is inside z, so x must be inside z. And since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it cannot touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) holds.

6. Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z))? No, because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so z cannot be inside x.

7. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z))? No, because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so z cannot be inside x.

8. Can x and z be equal (EQ(x,z))? No, because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x and z cannot be the same region.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me review the problem and my reasoning once more.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

To determine the relation between x and z, I consider what these conditions tell us:

1. x is inside y (from NTPP(x,y))
2. y is inside z (from TPP(y,z))
3. Therefore, x is inside z (transitivity of "inside")

Now, the question is whether x touches the boundary of z:

4. x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y))
5. y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z))
6. For x to touch z's boundary, it would need to touch y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, but this contradicts (4).

Therefore, x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, which gives us NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, I think I've been making an error in my reasoning. Let me reconsider this.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these conditions, x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x must be inside z. The question is whether x touches z's boundary.

If x were to touch z's boundary, it would have to do so at a point where y also touches z's boundary (since x is inside y). But NTPP(x,y) means x doesn't touch y's boundary. 

Now, I need to be careful about the implications. Just because x doesn't touch y's boundary and y touches z's boundary doesn't necessarily mean x can't touch z's boundary. It depends on the specific geometry.

Let me consider a specific example:
- z is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point
- x is an even smaller circle inside y, positioned in such a way that it touches the boundary of z at the same point where y touches z

Is this arrangement consistent with NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z)?

NTPP(x,y) requires that x doesn't touch y's boundary. In the arrangement I described, x would touch y's boundary at the point where both y and z touch. This contradicts NTPP(x,y).

So, it seems that if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then x cannot touch z's boundary, which means the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check with another approach. If x touches z's boundary, it does so at a point p. Since x is inside y, p must also be on y's boundary. But this contradicts NTPP(x,y), which says x doesn't touch y's boundary.

Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary, and the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually I realize that I've been overlooking something important: the fact that NTPP and TPP are proper part relations.

Let me make sure I have the right definitions:

- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y, does not touch y's boundary, and x ≠ y.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z, touches z's boundary, and y ≠ z.

Given NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y without touching y's boundary. Given TPP(y,z), y is strictly inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
   This would mean x and z share no points. But since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x must also be inside z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x must be completely inside z, not just touching its boundary. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   This would mean x and z share some points, but neither is contained in the other. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x must be completely inside z. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   This would mean x is inside z, touches z's boundary, and x ≠ z. Since x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary, the question is whether x can touch z's boundary.

   If x were to touch z's boundary, it would have to do so at a point where y also touches z's boundary (since x is inside y). But for x to touch y's boundary at that point would contradict NTPP(x,y). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   This would mean x is inside z, doesn't touch z's boundary, and x ≠ z. Given that x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is inside z, x must be inside z. And since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it cannot touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse:
   This would mean z is inside x, touches x's boundary, and x ≠ z. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse:
   This would mean z is inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary, and x ≠ z. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, z cannot be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   This would mean x and z occupy the same space. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, and both NTPP and TPP are proper part relations (meaning x ≠ y and y ≠ z), x cannot be equal to z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm starting to second-guess myself. I think I need to carefully analyze the TPP relation to determine if x can touch the boundary of z.

TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary. This doesn't mean the entire boundary of y touches the boundary of z; it just means there's at least one point where they touch.

NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. This means there's some "buffer" of y between x and the boundary of y.

Now, the question is whether x can touch the boundary of z. For x to touch the boundary of z, it would have to do so at a point where y also touches the boundary of z (since x is inside y). But for x to reach that point, it would have to touch the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Therefore, x cannot touch the boundary of z, and the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually let me take a step back. I want to think about this more fundamentally. 

I'm given that NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- x is completely inside y.
- x does not touch the boundary of y.
- x is not equal to y.

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is completely inside z.
- y touches the boundary of z at least at one point.
- y is not equal to z.

From these, I can deduce:
- x is completely inside y, which is completely inside z, so x is completely inside z.
- x does not touch the boundary of y.
- y touches the boundary of z at some points.

Now, the question is whether x can touch the boundary of z. If x were to touch the boundary of z, it would have to do so at a point where y also touches the boundary of z (since x is inside y). But for x to reach that point, it would have to touch the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Therefore, x cannot touch the boundary of z, and the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I realize that I've been making a mistake in my reasoning. When I say "for x to reach that point, it would have to touch the boundary of y," I'm not being precise.

Let me re-examine the situation. If NTPP(x,y), then x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, consider the point (or points) where y touches z's boundary. At these points, the boundary of y coincides with the boundary of z. Since x doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(x,y)), x cannot touch these points. And since these are the only points where y touches the boundary of z, x cannot touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, x is inside z but doesn't touch its boundary, which means NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Let me try a third approach.

NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. This implies there's some "buffer" of y between x and the boundary of y.

TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary. This means that the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z at some points.

Now, let's consider a point p where the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z. At this point, p is on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Can x touch the boundary of z at point p? No, because that would mean x touches the boundary of y at point p, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Can x touch the boundary of z at some other point q? No, because for x to touch the boundary of z, it would have to "reach out" beyond the boundary of y, which is not possible given that x is inside y.

Therefore, x cannot touch the boundary of z, which means the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me take a slightly more formal approach using the basic definitions of the RCC-8 relations.

The RCC-8 relations are based on the notion of connection (C). Two regions are connected (C(x,y)) if they share at least one point.

From this, we can define:
- DC(x,y): ¬C(x,y) (x and y are disconnected)
- EC(x,y): C(x,y) ∧ ¬O(x,y) (x and y are externally connected, i.e., they touch but don't overlap)
- PO(x,y): O(x,y) ∧ ¬P(x,y) ∧ ¬P(y,x) (x and y partially overlap)
- TPP(x,y): P(x,y) ∧ ¬PP(x,y) ∧ ∃z[EC(z,x) ∧ EC(z,y)] (x is a tangential proper part of y)
- NTPP(x,y): PP(x,y) ∧ ¬∃z[EC(z,x) ∧ EC(z,y)] (x is a non-tangential proper part of y)
- TPPi(x,y): TPP(y,x) (inverse of TPP)
- NTPPi(x,y): NTPP(y,x) (inverse of NTPP)
- EQ(x,y): P(x,y) ∧ P(y,x) (x and y are equal)

where:
- O(x,y) means x and y overlap, i.e., they share at least one interior point.
- P(x,y) means x is part of y, i.e., every point of x is also a point of y.
- PP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, i.e., P(x,y) ∧ ¬P(y,x).

Now, given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), I can deduce:

NTPP(x,y) means PP(x,y) ∧ ¬∃w[EC(w,x) ∧ EC(w,y)]. This means x is a proper part of y, and there's no region w that is externally connected to both x and y.

TPP(y,z) means P(y,z) ∧ ¬PP(y,z) ∧ ∃w[EC(w,y) ∧ EC(w,z)]. This means y is a proper part of z, and there's a region w that is externally connected to both y and z.

From P(x,y) and P(y,z), I can deduce P(x,z) by transitivity. This means x is part of z.

Now, I need to determine if x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

TPP(x,z) would mean ∃w[EC(w,x) ∧ EC(w,z)], i.e., there's a region w that is externally connected to both x and z.

NTPP(x,z) would mean ¬∃w[EC(w,x) ∧ EC(w,z)], i.e., there's no region w that is externally connected to both x and z.

Given NTPP(x,y), I know ¬∃w[EC(w,x) ∧ EC(w,y)]. This means there's no region w that is externally connected to both x and y.

Now, suppose there's a region w that is externally connected to both x and z. Since x is inside y, w must also be externally connected to y. But this would mean w is externally connected to both x and y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Therefore, there's no region w that is externally connected to both x and z, which means NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Let me trace this through using a concrete example. I need to check if it's possible to have TPP(x,z).

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
1. x is a proper part of z: P(x,z) ∧ ¬P(z,x)
2. x touches the boundary of z: ∃w[EC(w,x) ∧ EC(w,z)]

For point 2, let's say there exists a region w that is externally connected to both x and z. Since x is inside y (from NTPP(x,y)), w must also be externally connected to y. 

But NTPP(x,y) means there's no region w' that is externally connected to both x and y. This is a contradiction.

Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible, and the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Alright. Let me check once more using a direct argument.

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is inside y.
- x doesn't touch the boundary of y.

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is inside z.
- y touches the boundary of z.

From these, I can deduce:
- x is inside y, which is inside z, so x is inside z.
- x doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- y touches the boundary of z.

The question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

For x to touch the boundary of z, it would have to do so at a point p where the boundary of z and the boundary of y meet (since x is inside y). But at such a point p, x would also be touching the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Therefore, x cannot touch the boundary of z, and the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'd like to explore this from a different angle, to make absolutely sure.

Let's think about the RCC-8 relations in terms of the boundaries and interiors of regions.

- NTPP(x,y) means the interior of x is completely inside the interior of y, and the boundary of x is completely inside the interior of y.
- TPP(y,z) means the interior of y is completely inside the interior of z, and the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z.

Given these, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

- The interior of x is completely inside the interior of y, which is completely inside the interior of z. So, the interior of x is completely inside the interior of z.
- The boundary of x is completely inside the interior of y. The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z. This means the boundary of x is separated from the boundary of z by the interior of y. Therefore, the boundary of x is completely inside the interior of z.

This gives us NTPP(x,z), where the interior of x is completely inside the interior of z, and the boundary of x is completely inside the interior of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

Actually, thinking about it one more time, I think I want to be really, really sure.

Let's say we have NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means:
- The interior of x is a subset of the interior of y.
- The boundary of x is a subset of the interior of y.
- The exterior of y is a subset of the exterior of x.

TPP(y,z) means:
- The interior of y is a subset of the interior of z.
- The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z.
- The boundary of y also intersects with the interior of z.
- The exterior of z is a subset of the exterior of y.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I'll analyze the relationships between their interiors, boundaries, and exteriors.

First, the interior of x:
- The interior of x is a subset of the interior of y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- The interior of y is a subset of the interior of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- Therefore, the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z.

Next, the boundary of x:
- The boundary of x is a subset of the interior of y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- The interior of y is a subset of the interior of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- Therefore, the boundary of x is a subset of the interior of z.

Finally, the exterior of z:
- The exterior of z is a subset of the exterior of y (from TPP(y,z)).
- The exterior of y is a subset of the exterior of x (from NTPP(x,y)).
- Therefore, the exterior of z is a subset of the exterior of x.

These relationships correspond to NTPP(x,z), which means:
- The interior of x is a subset of the interior of z.
- The boundary of x is a subset of the interior of z.
- The exterior of z is a subset of the exterior of x.

Therefore, the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

I've analyzed this problem from multiple perspectives, and they all lead to the same conclusion. Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to double-check once more, using the conceptual definitions.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- x is completely inside y.
- x doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- x is not equal to y.

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is completely inside z.
- y touches the boundary of z at at least one point.
- y is not equal to z.

From these, I can deduce:
- x is completely inside y, which is completely inside z, so x is completely inside z.
- x doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- y touches the boundary of z at at least one point.

Now, let's determine if x touches the boundary of z.

Let me denote the boundary of a region r as ∂r.

From NTPP(x,y), we know that x ∩ ∂y = ∅ (x doesn't intersect with the boundary of y).
From TPP(y,z), we know that y ∩ ∂z ≠ ∅ (y intersects with the boundary of z).

For x to touch the boundary of z, we would need x ∩ ∂z ≠ ∅. Since x is completely inside y, any point in x is also in y. So, if x intersects with the boundary of z, it means there's a point p such that p ∈ x and p ∈ ∂z. Since p ∈ x, we also have p ∈ y. So, p ∈ y and p ∈ ∂z, which means p ∈ y ∩ ∂z.

But we know that y ∩ ∂z is a subset of ∂y. If p ∈ y ∩ ∂z, then p ∈ ∂y. This would mean x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Therefore, x cannot touch the boundary of z, and the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait a second. I'm not convinced by the previous step. I said that y ∩ ∂z is a subset of ∂y. I don't think that's necessarily true. If y touches the boundary of z, it means there's a point where the boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z. But there might also be parts of y that are completely inside z, and parts of the boundary of z that are not on the boundary of y.

Actually, let me try to be even more direct.

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z):
1. x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

For x to touch the boundary of z, it would have to do so at a point p where p ∈ x and p ∈ ∂z. Since x is inside y, p ∈ y as well. So, p ∈ y and p ∈ ∂z, which means p ∈ y ∩ ∂z.

Now, the question is whether p can also be on the boundary of y. Since x doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(x,y)), if p ∈ x, then p ∉ ∂y.

So, p ∈ y ∩ ∂z and p ∉ ∂y. This means p is in the interior of y and on the boundary of z. But if y touches z's boundary, it means there's a point on the boundary of y that's also on the boundary of z. It doesn't mean the entire boundary of z is in contact with y.

Now, if p is in the interior of y and on the boundary of z, and y touches z's boundary at some other point, it's possible for p to be on the boundary of z but not on the boundary of y.

Let me think about this more carefully.

Wait, let's approach this yet more directly.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means the closure of x is a subset of the interior of y. Here, the closure of a region includes both its interior and boundary, and the interior of a region excludes its boundary.

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means the closure of y is a subset of the closure of z, and the intersection of the boundary of y and the boundary of z is not empty.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- The closure of x is a subset of the interior of y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- The interior of y is a subset of the interior of z (since y is inside z).
- Therefore, the closure of x is a subset of the interior of z.

This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Let me explain the proof again, but more carefully.

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y.
- x doesn't touch the boundary of y.

In terms of interiors and boundaries:
- The interior of x is a subset of the interior of y.
- The boundary of x is a subset of the interior of y.

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z.
- y touches the boundary of z.

In terms of interiors and boundaries:
- The interior of y is a subset of the interior of z.
- The boundary of y intersects with the boundary of z.
- The boundary of y is a subset of the closure of z.

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z.

First, is x a part of z? Yes, because:
- The interior of x is a subset of the interior of y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- The interior of y is a subset of the interior of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- Therefore, the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z.
- The boundary of x is a subset of the interior of y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- The interior of y is a subset of the interior of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- Therefore, the boundary of x is a subset of the interior of z.
- Thus, the entire closure of x (which includes its interior and boundary) is a subset of the interior of z.

This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

In conclusion, if NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me break down what I know:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary

From these relations, I can deduce:
- Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x must be inside z
- Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, x cannot touch z's boundary

For x to touch the boundary of z, it would have to touch the boundary of y at the point where y touches z, but this contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Since x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
