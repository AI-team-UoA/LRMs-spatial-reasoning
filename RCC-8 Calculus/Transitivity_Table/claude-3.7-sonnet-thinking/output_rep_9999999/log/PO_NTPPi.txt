PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let's recall what these relations mean:
- PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z. This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So we know:
1. x partially overlaps with y
2. z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)

Let's think about what relationships are possible between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Can x and z be disconnected? Since x partially overlaps with y, and z is completely inside y, it's possible that x overlaps with a part of y that doesn't contain z. So yes, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Can x and z touch at a boundary? Since z doesn't touch y's boundary (by definition of NTPP), and x only partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x touches z at z's boundary which is inside y. So yes, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlap: Can x and z share a part without either being part of the other? Since x partially overlaps with y, and z is inside y, it's possible that x and z share a part. So yes, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: Can x be a tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that the part of x that overlaps with y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. So yes, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: Can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary? Similar to the previous case, it's possible that the part of x that overlaps with y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So yes, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse: Can z be a tangential proper part of x? For this to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z is within the overlap region of x and y, and touches x's boundary. So yes, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse: Can z be completely inside x without touching x's boundary? Similar to the previous case, it's possible that z is within the overlap region of x and y, and doesn't touch x's boundary. So yes, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: Can x and z be the same region? For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside y (since z is), but PO(x,y) tells us that x is only partially inside y. So no, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, wait. Let me double-check this. I think I made an error in my reasoning.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x partially overlaps with y
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z, which means NTPP(z,y) or z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary

I need to think more carefully about what these tell us:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Can x and z be disconnected? Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x only overlaps with parts of y that don't include z. So yes, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Can x and z touch at a boundary? Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that x touches z at z's boundary. So yes, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlap: Can x and z share a part without either being part of the other? Since x partially overlaps with y, and z is inside y, it's possible that x and z share a part. So yes, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: Can x be a tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and z is completely inside y, it's possible that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, but only if x is also completely inside y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So no, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, wait, I think there's an issue with my reasoning. Let me rethink this.

Given PO(x,y), we know that x partially overlaps with y. So there's a part of x that's inside y, and a part of x that's outside y.

Given NTPPi(y,z), we know that y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z, which means NTPP(z,y) or z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.

So z is completely inside y, and y partially overlaps with x. Let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Can x and z be disconnected? It's possible that z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x. So yes, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Can x and z touch at a boundary? It's possible that z is positioned such that it touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y. So yes, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlap: Can x and z share a part without either being part of the other? It's possible that z overlaps with the part of x that's inside y. So yes, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: Can x be a tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But given PO(x,y), we know that x is partially outside y. Since z is completely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z. So no, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let's be more precise.

Given PO(x,y), we know:
- x and y share a spatial part
- Neither x is part of y, nor y is part of x
- This means there's a part of x outside y, and a part of y outside x

Given NTPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), we know:
- z is completely inside y
- z doesn't touch y's boundary

Now, let's consider all possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, it's possible that z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Can x and z touch at a boundary? Yes, it's possible that z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlap: Can x and z share a part without either being part of the other? Yes, it's possible that z overlaps with the part of x that's inside y.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: Can x be a tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But given PO(x,y), we know that x is partially outside y. Since z is completely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z. So no, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: Can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary? Similar to the previous case, since x is partially outside y and z is completely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z. So no, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse: Can z be a tangential proper part of x? For this to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Given that z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z is within the overlap region of x and y, and touches x's boundary. So yes, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse: Can z be completely inside x without touching x's boundary? Similar to the previous case, it's possible that z is within the overlap region of x and y, and doesn't touch x's boundary. So yes, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: Can x and z be the same region? For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside y (since z is), but PO(x,y) tells us that x is only partially inside y. So no, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I may still be confusing myself. Let's think this through more carefully, step by step.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x partially overlaps with y
- NTPPi(y,z): equivalent to NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary

Let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: 
   - This means x and z don't share any parts.
   - Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
   - So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   - This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
   - Since z is inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y.
   - So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlap:
   - This means x and z share a part, but neither is completely inside the other.
   - Since z is inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z overlaps with the part of x that's inside y.
   - So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   - This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   - Given PO(x,y), we know that part of x is outside y. Since z is completely inside y, it's not possible for x to be completely inside z.
   - So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   - This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - Similar to the previous case, since part of x is outside y and z is completely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z.
   - So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse:
   - This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
   - Since z is inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z is within the overlap region of x and y, and touches x's boundary.
   - So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse:
   - This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - Similar to the previous case, it's possible that z is within the overlap region of x and y, and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   - This means x and z are the same region.
   - Given PO(x,y), we know that part of x is outside y. Since z is completely inside y, x and z cannot be the same region.
   - So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, wait a minute. I don't think DC(x,z) is possible. Given NTPPi(y,z), z is a proper part of y. And since PO(x,y), x and y share a part. But if z is a proper part of y, and y and x share a part, z must at least be externally connected to x.

Actually, I'm confusing myself a bit. Let's try to draw this out.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x partially overlaps with y
- NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z (z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary)

We have:
- x and y share a part
- z is completely inside y

Scenario 1: z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x. In this case, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 2: z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y. In this case, x and z are externally connected, so EC(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 3: z overlaps with the part of x that's inside y. In this case, x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 4: z is completely inside the overlap region of x and y, and touches the boundary of this region. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 5: z is completely inside the overlap region of x and y, and doesn't touch the boundary of this region. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For the other relationships:
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible because part of x is outside y, and z is completely inside y, so x cannot be completely inside z.
- EQ(x,z) is not possible because x and y partially overlap, so x is partially outside y, but z is completely inside y, so x and z cannot be the same region.

Actually, I'm not sure I've been careful enough. Let's draw out each scenario more explicitly.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x partially overlaps with y
- NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z (z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary)

Scenario 1: z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
Here, z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, but z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x. So x and z don't share any parts and are disconnected. Thus, DC(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 2: z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y.
Here, z is completely inside y, and touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y. So x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Thus, EC(x,z) is possible.

Actually, wait. I think I need to be more careful about the definition of EC. EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. But if z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y, it means z touches a point that's in both x and y. So z shares a point with x, which means they're not disconnected. But if z only touches a boundary point of x, they don't share any interior parts, so they're externally connected. Thus, EC(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 3: z overlaps with the part of x that's inside y.
Here, z is completely inside y, and overlaps with the part of x that's inside y. So x and z share a part, but neither is completely inside the other (since part of x is outside y, and thus outside z). Thus, PO(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 4: z is completely inside the overlap region of x and y, and touches the boundary of this region.
Here, z is completely inside the overlap region of x and y, which means z is completely inside x. Additionally, z touches the boundary of this overlap region, which is a boundary of x. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, wait. I need to be careful about the definition of the boundary. The boundary of the overlap region of x and y is not necessarily a boundary of x. It could be a boundary of y that's inside x. Let me reconsider.

Actually, let's think more carefully about Scenario 4. If z is completely inside the overlap region of x and y, and touches the boundary of this region, we need to determine if this boundary is a boundary of x. If it is, then z touches a boundary of x, and TPPi(x,z) is possible. If not, then z doesn't touch a boundary of x, and NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let's be more precise. The boundary of the overlap region of x and y consists of parts of the boundary of x that are inside y, and parts of the boundary of y that are inside x. If z touches a part of the boundary of x that's inside y, then z touches a boundary of x, and TPPi(x,z) is possible. If z only touches parts of the boundary of y that are inside x, then z doesn't touch a boundary of x, and NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible, depending on which part of the boundary of the overlap region z touches.

Scenario 5: z is completely inside the overlap region of x and y, and doesn't touch the boundary of this region.
Here, z is completely inside the overlap region of x and y, which means z is completely inside x. Additionally, z doesn't touch the boundary of this overlap region, which means z doesn't touch any boundary of x. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For the other relationships:
- TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible because part of x is outside y, and z is completely inside y, so x cannot be completely inside z.
- EQ(x,z) is not possible because x and y partially overlap, so x is partially outside y, but z is completely inside y, so x and z cannot be the same region.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I'm still not convinced about my reasoning for TPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. The issue is that since z is completely inside y, and there are parts of x outside y, z can't touch those parts of x's boundary that are outside y. But z could still touch parts of x's boundary that are inside y.

So the question is: can z touch parts of x's boundary that are inside y? Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(z,y)), z doesn't touch y's boundary. So z can only touch parts of x's boundary that are strictly inside y, not on y's boundary.

So if x has a boundary strictly inside y (not on y's boundary), and z touches this boundary, then TPPi(x,z) is possible. Otherwise, NTPPi(x,z) is the only possibility for z being completely inside x.

Actually I think my analysis is still not quite right. Let's break it down step-by-step:

Given:
- PO(x,y): x partially overlaps with y
- NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z (z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary)

Now, let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
   - This means x and z don't share any parts.
   - Since z is completely inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.
   - So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   - This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
   - Since z is inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y, but doesn't overlap with x's interior.
   - So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlap:
   - This means x and z share a part, but neither is completely inside the other.
   - Since z is inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z overlaps with the part of x that's inside y, but not all of z is inside x, and not all of x is inside z.
   - So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   - This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   - Given PO(x,y), we know that part of x is outside y. Since z is completely inside y, it's not possible for x to be completely inside z.
   - So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   - This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   - Similar to the previous case, since part of x is outside y and z is completely inside y, x cannot be completely inside z.
   - So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse:
   - This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
   - Since z is inside y, and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z is within the overlap region of x and y, and touches x's boundary.
   - Actually, wait. A more careful analysis is needed. Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(z,y)), z doesn't touch y's boundary. So z can only touch parts of x's boundary that are strictly inside y, not on y's boundary. But if x and y partially overlap, there will be parts of x's boundary inside y. So it's possible for z to touch x's boundary, and TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, hang on. Let's think about this more visually. If x and y partially overlap, and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, then if z is also completely inside x, z might touch x's boundary. But it can only touch parts of x's boundary that are inside y, not on y's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse:
   - This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - Similar to the previous case, it's possible that z is within the overlap region of x and y, and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   - So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   - This means x and z are the same region.
   - Given PO(x,y), we know that part of x is outside y. Since z is completely inside y, x and z cannot be the same region.
   - So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So to summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, hold on. Let me recheck my analysis of EC(x,z).

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. For this to be true, z must touch x's boundary, but not overlap with x's interior. But since z is completely inside y, and doesn't touch y's boundary, z can only touch parts of x's boundary that are strictly inside y, not on y's boundary.

Now, if x and y partially overlap, and z is in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x, but touches the boundary of the overlap region, then z touches x's boundary but doesn't share any interior parts with x. So EC(x,z) is possible.

Yes, I think EC(x,z) is possible.

So again, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, now I'm second-guessing myself about TPPi(x,z). Let me draw this out more carefully.

TPPi(x,z) means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. For this to be true, z must be completely inside x, and touch a boundary of x.

Given PO(x,y), x and y partially overlap. This means there's a part of x inside y, and a part of x outside y.

Given NTPPi(y,z), z is completely inside y, and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So z is completely inside y. For z to be completely inside x, z must be within the overlap region of x and y. For z to touch x's boundary, z must touch a boundary of x. But since z doesn't touch y's boundary, z can only touch parts of x's boundary that are strictly inside y, not on y's boundary.

This scenario is also possible. When x and y partially overlap, the boundary of x inside y consists of parts of the boundary of the overlap region. It's possible for z to be completely inside the overlap region (thus completely inside x), and touch a part of x's boundary inside y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let's one more time enumerate the possible relationships between x and z:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

So the final answer is:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to find all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let me break down what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some space but neither is contained in the other
- NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z without z touching y's boundary (equivalent to NTPP(z,y))

Now I'll analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   Since z is completely inside y, and x only partially overlaps with y, z could be located in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   Z could be positioned so it touches the boundary of the overlap between x and y, without sharing interior points with x. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   Z could overlap with part of x (in their shared region with y) without either containing the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z):
   Since x extends outside of y (by PO(x,y)) but z is completely inside y, x cannot be completely contained in z. These relations are impossible.

5. TPPi(x,z):
   Z could be completely inside the x-y overlap region and touch x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

6. NTPPi(x,z):
   Z could be completely inside the x-y overlap region without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. EQ(x,z):
   Since x extends outside y but z is completely inside y, they cannot be equal. This relation is impossible.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
