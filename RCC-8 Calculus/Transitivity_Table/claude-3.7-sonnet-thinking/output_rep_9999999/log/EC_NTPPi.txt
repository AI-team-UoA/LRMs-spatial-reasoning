PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine what the possible relationships between x and z are. Let's analyze this.

Since EC(x,y), x and y touch only at their boundaries, and have no common interior parts.
Since NTPP(z,y), z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
This means x and z have no common parts and do not touch. Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z cannot share any points. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
This means x and z touch at their boundaries but have no common interior. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot touch at their boundaries. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
This means x and z have a common part, but neither is completely contained in the other. Given that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot overlap. So, PO(x,z) is not a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, x cannot be inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary and z is completely inside y not touching y's boundary, x cannot be inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse:
This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, z cannot be a proper part of x touching x's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse:
This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given the constraints, z is inside y and x is outside y (only touching y's boundary), so z cannot be a part of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
This means x and z are the same region. Since z is inside y and x is outside y (only touching y's boundary), they cannot be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z) - Disconnected.

Hmm, I'm a bit suspicious that I only got one possible relation. Let me double check.

Actually, I think I made an error in my interpretation. Let's be more precise. 

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary. And x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

In this scenario, x and z are disconnected. x is outside y, only touching y's boundary, while z is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary. Therefore, x and z have no common parts and don't even touch.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z) - Disconnected.

Actually, let me think once more. 

EC(x,y) means x and y share only boundary points, not interior points.
NTPPi(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y doesn't touch z's boundary. In other words, y is completely contained inside z.

Given these constraints:
- x and y share only boundary points.
- y is completely contained inside z, away from z's boundary.

Let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
If x and z are disconnected, then x and y would also be disconnected, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, DC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Wait, that's not necessarily true. Let me reconsider.

Since y is completely contained inside z, the boundary of y might be completely inside z. So, x could touch y at the boundary, which is inside z, but x could be disconnected from z. Let me reconsider this.

Actually, I think I've been interpreting NTPPi(y,z) incorrectly. Let's correct this.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, the correct interpretation is:
- x and y share only boundary points.
- z is completely contained inside y, away from y's boundary.

Now, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
Given that z is completely inside y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z do not have any common points. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
For x and z to be externally connected, they must touch at their boundaries. But z is away from y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary. So, x and z cannot touch. EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
For x and z to partially overlap, they must share some interior points. But z is completely inside y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary without sharing any interior points with y. So, x and z cannot share any interior points. PO(x,z) is not a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But given that z is completely inside y, away from y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, x cannot be inside z. TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be completely inside z, away from z's boundary. But given that x touches y's boundary and z is completely inside y, away from y's boundary, x cannot be inside z. NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse:
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But given that z is completely inside y, away from y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, z cannot be inside x and touch x's boundary. TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse:
For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be completely inside x, away from x's boundary. But given the constraints, z is inside y and x is outside y (only touching y's boundary), z cannot be inside x. NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
For x and z to be equal, they must be the same region. But given that z is inside y and x is outside y (only touching y's boundary), they cannot be the same region. EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z) - Disconnected.

Actually, no, I think I'm going back and forth and making things confusing. Let me just review the definitions and make sure I understand them correctly.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

OK, z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

What is the relation between x and z?

Since z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary, and x and y only touch at a boundary, x and z cannot overlap nor touch. So x and z are disconnected.

Therefore, the possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I'm still getting confused with the NTPPi relation. Let me ensure I understand this correctly. From the definition:

NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y).

So, if NTPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then NTPPi(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

With this understanding:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
If x and z are disconnected, then x and y would also be disconnected (since y is a proper part of z). But this contradicts EC(x,y). So, DC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
If x and z are externally connected, they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is a possibility. Since y is inside z, away from z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, x could also touch z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

Hmm, I think I need to be more careful about this. We know that:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given that y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary, the boundary of y is also inside z. x touches y at the boundary, which means x intersects with the boundary of y. But the boundary of y is inside z, so x intersects with the interior of z. This means x and z could share some interior points.

I don't think my reasoning is accurate. Let me try to draw this out conceptually.

y is properly inside z, not touching z's boundary.
x touches y at their boundary.

Since y is completely inside z, the boundary of y is also inside z (not touching z's boundary). When x touches y at the boundary, x is touching a part that's inside z. This means x could potentially intersect with the interior of z.

Let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
For x and z to be disconnected, they must not share any points. But since x touches y's boundary and y's boundary is inside z, x must intersect with z. So, DC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
For x and z to be externally connected, they must touch at a boundary but not share interior points. But as explained earlier, x must intersect with the interior of z. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
For x and z to partially overlap, they must share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other. Given that x touches y's boundary and y's boundary is inside z, x must intersect with the interior of z. And since x is not completely inside y (it only touches y's boundary), x cannot be completely inside z. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

Actually, I still think I'm not getting this right. Let me try to be clearer.

EC(x,y) means x and y share only boundary points, not interior points.
NTPPi(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Here's a simple illustration:

```
    +---------------------+
    |                     |
    |         z           |
    |                     |
    |    +-----------+    |
    |    |           |    |
    |    |     y     |    |
    |    |           |    |
    |    +-----+-----+    |
    |          |          |
    |          x          |
    |                     |
    +---------------------+
```

In this illustration, y is inside z, away from z's boundary. x touches y at the boundary. Based on this, x would also intersect with z (specifically, x would be partially inside z).

Let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. But as shown in the illustration, x intersects with z. So, DC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
If x and z are externally connected, they touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. But as shown in the illustration, x penetrates inside z. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other. As shown in the illustration, x penetrates inside z, but a part of x is also outside z. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
If x is a tangential proper part of z, x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But as shown in the illustration, a part of x is outside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, x is completely inside z, away from z's boundary. But as shown in the illustration, a part of x is outside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse:
If z is a tangential proper part of x, z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But as shown in the illustration, z is larger than x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse:
If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, z is completely inside x, away from x's boundary. But as shown in the illustration, z is larger than x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
If x and z are equal, they are the same region. But as shown in the illustration, they are different regions. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Based on this analysis, the possible relation between x and z is PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping.

But, I'm a bit uncertain about this. Let me reconsider another possibility. What if x is a bit different from what I illustrated?

```
    +---------------------+
    |                     |
    |         z           |
    |                     |
    |    +-----------+    |
    |    |           |    |
    |    |     y     |    |
    |    |           |    |
    |    +-----------+    |
    |          |          |
    |          |          |
    |          x          |
    +----------|---------+
               |
               |
```

In this case, x is outside z, but touches y at the boundary. This satisfies EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). In this case, the relation between x and z would be EC(x,z).

Actually, as I draw out these cases, I do realize that we don't have enough information to uniquely determine the relation between x and z. Based on the given information, both PO(x,z) and EC(x,z) are possible.

But wait, I'm thinking that in the case of EC(x,z), part of x's boundary that touches y would have to be inside z's interior, which contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) might not be possible.

Let's make sure again.

EC(x,y) means x and y share only boundary points, not interior points.
NTPPi(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

In the 2D plane, the boundary of y is a closed curve inside z. When x touches y at the boundary, x's boundary intersects with y's boundary. This point of intersection is inside z. If x is outside z, for x to touch y, x's boundary would have to cross z's boundary. But then, x and z would share a boundary point, making them EC.

Actually, I think there's another possibility: DC. If x is completely outside z, and it's only the "tip" of x that touches y's boundary, then x and z could be DC.

Hmm. This is getting trickier than I thought. Let's step back a bit. I think my confusion arose from trying to visualize this in the 2D plane. Let's think about it more abstractly.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y share only boundary points, not interior points.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's consider all the possibilities for the relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z):
If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. But since x touches y's boundary and y is inside z, x must at least touch a point inside z, which means x and z cannot be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z):
If x and z are externally connected, they share only boundary points, not interior points. For this to happen, x should touch z's boundary. But given that x touches y's boundary and y is inside z, not touching z's boundary, x must penetrate z to touch y. This means x and z share interior points, not just boundary points. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, I think I made a mistake here. Let's visualize this in a 1D setting to simplify.

Imagine a line segment z, and inside it, a smaller line segment y that doesn't touch the endpoints of z. Now, x is a line segment that touches one of the endpoints of y. In this setting, x penetrates into z to touch y, making them PO.

OK, but I'm not sure if the 1D analogy is the right one.

Actually, if think of a more general topoligical setting, where y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then the boundary of y is part of the interior of z. Consequently, a point on the boundary of y is in the interior of z. Now, if x touches y only at the boundary (EC(x,y)), then x touches a point in the interior of z. This means x and z share at least one interior point, which is the point where x touches y's boundary.

So, the relation between x and z can be one of:
1. PO(x,z): If x partially overlaps with z, sharing some interior points but not being completely inside or outside.
2. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, being completely inside z and touching z's boundary.

Actually, let's verify for TPP. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x is completely inside z, then x and y can only touch at y's boundary. This would contradict the given information. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

I think the only possible relation between x and z is PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping.

Actually, I realized I made a mistake in my reasoning again. 

If x is completely inside z, there's no contradiction with EC(x,y). This is because we're saying that x touches y at the boundary, not that x is outside y. 

I think I need to be more systematic. Let's consider all the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z):
For x and z to be disconnected, they must not share any points. But since x touches y's boundary and y's boundary is inside z, x and z must share at least one point. So, DC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z):
For x and z to be externally connected, they must share only boundary points, not interior points. But as explained earlier, the point where x touches y's boundary is in the interior of z. This means x and z share an interior point of z, which contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z):
For x and z to partially overlap, they must share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other. Given that x touches y's boundary and y's boundary is inside z, x and z share an interior point of z. As long as x is not completely inside z, they would be in a PO relation. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z):
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary and y's boundary is inside z, x intersects with the interior of z. If x is completely inside z and also touches z's boundary, they would be in a TPP relation. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z):
For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be completely inside z, away from z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary and y's boundary is inside z, x intersects with the interior of z. If x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary, they would be in an NTPP relation. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z):
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But given that y is inside z and x touches y's boundary, z cannot be completely inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be completely inside x, away from x's boundary. But given that y is inside z and x touches y's boundary, z cannot be completely inside x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z):
For x and z to be equal, they must be the same region. But given that y is inside z and x touches y's boundary, x and z cannot be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Let's check if I made any errors in the above reasoning.

For TPP, can x be a tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But we know that x touches y's boundary, and y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means the point where x touches y's boundary is in the interior of z. If x also touches z's boundary, then x touches both the interior and the boundary of z, which is consistent with TPP. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

For NTPP, can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x must be completely inside z, away from z's boundary. If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, while also touching y's boundary, then x and z would be in an NTPP relation. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

For PO, can x partially overlap with z? For this to be true, x and z must share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other. Given that x touches y's boundary and y's boundary is inside z, x and z share an interior point of z. If a part of x is outside z, they would be in a PO relation. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

I think the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Actually, wait. Let me think.

We know that EC(x,y). That means x and y are disjoint, except for a shared boundary.
And we know that NTPPi(y,z). That means y properly contains z, and the boundary of y is disjoint from the boundary of z.

Let's try to visualize this. Region y properly contains region z, and the boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of z. Region x is outside of region y, but touches y's boundary. 

Actually no, I think I'm getting confused because of how I'm thinking about the boundaries.

EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

OK, so we have:
- x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- y is inside z, away from z's boundary.

If y is inside z, away from z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then x touches a point inside z. This means x and z share at least one point, which is in the interior of z and on the boundary of y.

Let me rethink this systematically. 

if EC(x,y), then x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means that all points in the intersection of x and y are boundary points of both x and y.

If NTPPi(y,z), then y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means that y is completely inside z, and the boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of z. Therefore, the boundary of y is inside the interior of z.

Now, given that x touches y's boundary, x touches a point that's in the interior of z. This means x and z share at least one interior point of z.

Depending on how much x penetrates into z and whether x touches z's boundary, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. PO(x,z): If x partially overlaps with z, sharing some interior points, but a part of x is also outside z.
2. TPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
3. NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

Let's double-check for any errors.

For TPP, can x be a tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary.

For NTPP, can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x must be completely inside z, away from z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary.

For PO, can x partially overlap with z? For this to be true, x and z must share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other. This is possible if x touches y's boundary (which is inside z), but a part of x is also outside z.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Let me check if there's any inconsistency or error in my reasoning.

Wait, actually. I think I've been making a mistake in the interpretation. Let's go back to the definitions:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

EC(x,y) implies that x and y share boundary points but no interior points. This means x is outside of y, but touches y's boundary. 

Now, NTPPi(y,z) implies that y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means y is completely inside z, and the boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given these, let's reconsider the relation between x and z:
We know that x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), and y's boundary is inside z, away from z's boundary (NTPPi(y,z)). This means x touches a point inside z. 

1. If x is completely inside z, the relation could be:
   a. TPP(x,z) if x touches z's boundary.
   b. NTPP(x,z) if x doesn't touch z's boundary.
   
2. If x is partially inside z (sharing some interior points with z) and partially outside z, the relation would be PO(x,z).

3. All other relations (DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are not possible based on the given information.

I am confident that the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Actually, wait. I had a thought. Let me reconsider if EC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Given that x touches y's boundary and y's boundary is inside z, x touches a point that's in the interior of z. This means x and z share an interior point of z, which contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

OK. So I think my set of possible relations is correct.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

Actually, wait. I think I've been making a mistake in my interpretation, again. I'm really overthinking this. I keep thinking that "x touches y at the boundary" means that x is outside of y, which is correct according to EC. But I also keep thinking that "a point on the boundary of y is in the interior of z" means that x touches a point in the interior of z, which is true. 

But what if x touches y's boundary at precisely the part of y's boundary that is on z's boundary?

Actually, no. That's not possible, because we're given NTPPi(y,z), which means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means the boundary of y is inside the interior of z. Therefore, when x touches y's boundary, x touches a point that's in the interior of z. This means x and z share at least one interior point of z.

So, I'm sticking with my answer that the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But y's boundary is completely inside z (away from z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary. If x also touches z's boundary, then x goes from y's boundary to z's boundary. This is consistent with TPP(x,z).

If NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z, away from z's boundary. This is consistent with x touching y's boundary (which is inside z) and not touching z's boundary.

If PO(x,z), then x partially overlaps with z. This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other. This is consistent with x touching y's boundary (which is inside z) and having a part of x outside z.

I'm pretty sure that the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

So, the final answer would be PO, TPP, NTPP.

Actually, wait. Let's think more abstractly.

We're given that:
- EC(x,y): x and y share only boundary points, not interior points.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's think about what these imply. 

First, EC(x,y) means that x and y are disjoint, except for some shared boundary points.
Second, NTPPi(y,z) means that y is completely inside z, and the boundary of y is inside the interior of z.

Now, if x and y share some boundary points, and those boundary points are inside the interior of z, then x and z must share some interior points of z. This means x and z cannot be disjoint (DC) or merely touching at a boundary (EC). They must share some interior points.

But that doesn't tell us if x is completely inside z, partially inside z, or if x contains z. 

Since y is completely inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, it's not possible for x to contain z. So, TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

This leaves us with PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) as the possible relations. 

PO(x,z) means x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other. This is possible if x touches y's boundary (which is inside z) and extends outside of z.

TPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary.

NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z, away from z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to consider the implications of the given relations and determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary (the boundary of y is completely in the interior of z).

Analyzing the implications:
- Since EC(x,y), x touches y only at their boundaries.
- Since NTPPi(y,z), y is completely inside z, and y's boundary is strictly inside z's interior.
- When x touches y's boundary, x is touching points that are in the interior of z.

This means x and z must share at least some interior points of z. Based on this:

1. PO(x,z) is possible - x can partially overlap with z (sharing some interior points but with part of x outside z).

2. TPP(x,z) is possible - x can be completely inside z while touching z's boundary (x touches y's boundary inside z, and also extends to touch z's boundary).

3. NTPP(x,z) is possible - x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary (x touches y's boundary but remains entirely within z's interior).

Other relations are impossible because x must share interior points with z, and cannot contain z.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
