PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is part of y and touches y's boundary.

2. NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now I need to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z. Since the RCC-8 relations are pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive, exactly one of the following must hold: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z).

Let's think about each one and see if it's possible given the constraints.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we know that both x and z are parts of y. If x and z are completely disconnected, then they don't share any spatial parts. But since they are both parts of y, they must share at least the part of y that is z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me rethink that. If z is a part of y, and x is a part of y, they don't necessarily share any parts. For example, if y is a square, x could be the left half and z could be the right half. They would both be parts of y but would not share any parts. 

Actually, but because NTPP(z,y), z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means it doesn't touch y's boundary. And TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, so it does touch y's boundary. So x and z don't necessarily overlap. But they still both exist within y. The question is whether they can be disconnected.

Oh, I see the issue. I was confusing "sharing parts" with "being connected". In RCC, two regions are disconnected if they have no points in common. So even if x and z are both parts of y, they can be disconnected if they don't share any points.

Let's draw a picture. Imagine y is a square. Let z be a circle in the middle of the square, not touching the boundary of the square. That's NTPP(z,y). Now let x be a thin strip along one edge of the square. That's TPP(x,y). Now, is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? Yes, if the circle z is far enough from the edge where x is, then x and z can be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect, i.e., they touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Is this possible? Yes, imagine the same setup as above, but now the circle z is big enough to touch the strip x at one point. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, i.e., they share some parts but neither is a part of the other. Is this possible? Yes, imagine the circle z now extends into the strip x, so they overlap in a non-empty region, but neither is contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? Remember that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, so z doesn't touch y's boundary. But x is a tangential proper part of y, so x does touch y's boundary. If x is contained in z, then x can't touch a part of y's boundary that z doesn't touch. So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, let me be a bit more careful here. TPP(x,z) would mean that x is a part of z and touches z's boundary. The fact that z doesn't touch y's boundary doesn't prevent x from touching z's boundary. But if x is a part of z, and z is a part of y, then x is a part of y (by transitivity of the parthood relation). But we know more specifically that x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning it touches y's boundary. But if x is inside z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, then x can't touch y's boundary either. This is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, if x is inside z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, then x can't touch y's boundary either. But we know that x does touch y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation either.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPP(z,x). If z is a part of x, and x is a part of y, then z is a part of y (by transitivity). But we know that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning it doesn't touch y's boundary. But if z is a tangential proper part of x, it touches x's boundary. And if x is a tangential proper part of y, then part of x's boundary is also y's boundary. So if z touches x's boundary, and part of x's boundary is also y's boundary, then z might touch y's boundary. That would contradict NTPP(z,y). 

But actually, z could touch a part of x's boundary that is not part of y's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) might be possible. Let me think about a concrete example.

Imagine y is a square. Let x be a smaller square inside y, with one edge of x on the boundary of y. That's TPP(x,y). Now, let z be a smaller square inside x, but not touching the boundary of x that is also the boundary of y. Instead, z only touches the parts of x's boundary that are in the interior of y. That would make TPP(z,x), but still NTPP(z,y). 

Actually, I'm making a mistake. If NTPP(z,y), that means z doesn't touch y's boundary. And if TPP(z,x), that means z touches x's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary (which it does since TPP(x,y)), then there's a part of x's boundary that is also y's boundary. But NTPP(z,y) implies that z doesn't touch any part of y's boundary, including the part that is also x's boundary. So if z touches x's boundary, it must only touch the parts of x's boundary that are not also y's boundary.

Actually, I think there's still a potential issue here. Let's carefully think about the definition of TPP.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is a part of y but y is not a part of x), and x touches y's boundary.

Now, if TPP(z,x), then z is a proper part of x, and z touches x's boundary. And if TPP(x,y), then x is a proper part of y, and x touches y's boundary. By transitivity of the proper part relation, z is a proper part of y. The question is whether z touches y's boundary.

Since NTPP(z,y), we know that z does not touch y's boundary. So if z touches x's boundary, it must only touch the parts of x's boundary that are not also y's boundary.

Is this possible? Let's try to draw a picture. Imagine y is a square. Let x be a smaller square inside y, with one edge of x on the boundary of y. That's TPP(x,y). Now, let z be a smaller square inside x. If z touches any part of x's boundary, it's either touching the part of x's boundary that is also y's boundary, or it's touching a part of x's boundary that is in the interior of y.

If z touches the part of x's boundary that is also y's boundary, then z touches y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(z,y). So z can only touch the parts of x's boundary that are in the interior of y. This is TPP(z,x). But then z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, which is NTPP(z,y). So TPPi(x,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,x)) is a possible relation.

Wait, let me think about this again. I think I've been making a mistake. If z is a tangential proper part of x, it doesn't necessarily mean that z touches every part of x's boundary. It just means that z touches some part of x's boundary. So it's entirely possible for z to touch only the parts of x's boundary that are in the interior of y, and not touch the parts of x's boundary that are also y's boundary.

Let's draw a picture. Imagine y is a square. Let x be a smaller square inside y, with one edge of x on the boundary of y. That's TPP(x,y). Now, let z be a smaller square inside x, touching one of the edges of x that is not on the boundary of y. Then z is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)), but z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(z,y)).

But this setup has z as a proper part of x, not the other way around. So it's TPP(z,x), not TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z). The relation TPPi(x,z) would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z, which is not the case in our example. So I don't think TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

Actually, let me think this through once more, because I'm not being very clear in my reasoning.

TPPi(x,z) means that TPP(z,x), which means that z is a tangential proper part of x. That is, z is a proper part of x, and z touches x's boundary.

We know that TPP(x,y), which means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is a proper part of y, and x touches y's boundary.

We also know that NTPPi(y,z), which means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch y's boundary.

Now, if TPP(z,x), then z is a proper part of x. And if x is a proper part of y, then z is a proper part of y (by transitivity). But we also know that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means that z does not touch y's boundary.

Now, if z touches x's boundary, it's either touching the part of x's boundary that is also y's boundary, or it's touching a part of x's boundary that is in the interior of y. If z touches the part of x's boundary that is also y's boundary, then z touches y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(z,y). So z can only touch the parts of x's boundary that are in the interior of y.

Let's again try to draw a picture. Imagine y is a square. Let x be a smaller square inside y, with one edge of x on the boundary of y. That's TPP(x,y). Now, let z be a smaller square inside x, touching one of the edges of x that is not on the boundary of y. Then z is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)), but z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(z,y)).

Oh wait, in this picture, z is a proper part of x, not the other way around. So it's TPP(z,x), not TPP(x,z) or TPPi(x,z). The relation TPPi(x,z) would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z, which is not the case in our example. 

I think I see the issue. Let's draw a different picture. Imagine y is a square. Let z be a smaller square inside y, not touching the boundary of y. That's NTPP(z,y). Now, let x be an even smaller square inside z, touching z's boundary. That's TPP(x,z).

But wait, this doesn't work either, because we were given that TPP(x,y), which means x touches y's boundary. But if x is inside z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, then x can't touch y's boundary either.

I think the issue is that the constraints we're given are incompatible with TPPi(x,z). So TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x). If z is a part of x, and x is a part of y, then z is a part of y (by transitivity). But we know that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning it doesn't touch y's boundary. This is consistent with z being a non-tangential proper part of x. And if x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning it touches y's boundary, this is also consistent with z being a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let's draw a picture. Imagine y is a square. Let x be a smaller square inside y, with one edge of x on the boundary of y. That's TPP(x,y). Now, let z be an even smaller square inside x, not touching x's boundary. That's NTPP(z,x). And since z doesn't touch x's boundary, it certainly doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(z,y) as well. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of NTPPi. NTPPi(x,z) means that NTPP(z,x), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So z is a proper part of x and z doesn't touch x's boundary. That's consistent with the picture I drew above.

8. EQ(x,z): This means that x and z are equal, i.e., they occupy the same space. If x = z, then TPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y) must both be true. But TPP(x,y) means that x touches y's boundary, while NTPP(z,y) means that z doesn't touch y's boundary. If x = z, then x touches y's boundary if and only if z touches y's boundary. But we're told that x does touch y's boundary and z doesn't, which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to double-check DC(x,z). I said it was possible because x could be a strip along the boundary of y and z could be a region in the interior of y, far from the boundary. But I need to think about the constraint NTPPi(y,z) more carefully.

NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. But actually, the constraint we're given is NTPPi(y,z), not NTPP(z,y). NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Wait, this doesn't make sense with the other constraint. If y is contained in z, but x is a tangential proper part of y, then x is also contained in z. But then x can't be disconnected from z.

I think I need to re-examine the whole problem more carefully.

We're given that TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary. NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is a proper part of z and y doesn't touch z's boundary. In other words, y is contained in the interior of z.

Now let's think about the possible relations between x and z.

Since y is a proper part of z, and x is a proper part of y, we have that x is a proper part of z (by transitivity of the proper part relation). So x is either a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

Let's think about whether x touches z's boundary. We know that x touches y's boundary. But y doesn't touch z's boundary; y is contained in the interior of z. So x can't touch z's boundary. So x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is that the possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me just visualize this to double-check. Imagine z is a square. Let y be a smaller square inside z, not touching the boundary of z. That's NTPP(y,z). Now, let x be an even smaller square inside y, touching y's boundary. That's TPP(x,y). Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, we have that x is inside z. But x doesn't touch z's boundary, because it's separated from z's boundary by the ring of y that's not x. So x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm a bit confused by the diagram I'm imagining. Let me try again.

We're given that TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), not NTPP(y,z). So we have that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, not the other way around.

Let me restart this solution. We're given that TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is a proper part of y, and x touches y's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is a proper part of y, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

So we have that both x and z are proper parts of y. But x touches y's boundary, while z doesn't. This doesn't tell us anything about the relationship between x and z directly.

Let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means that x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? Yes, if x is a region near the boundary of y and z is a region in the interior of y, far from x. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): This means that x and z externally connect, i.e., they touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Is this possible? Yes, if x is a region that touches y's boundary and z is a region in the interior of y that touches x but doesn't overlap with it. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): This means that x and z partially overlap, i.e., they share some parts but neither is a part of the other. Is this possible? Yes, if x is a region that touches y's boundary and extends into the interior of y, and z is a region in the interior of y that overlaps with x but neither is contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): This means that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? If x is contained in z, and z is contained in y, then x is contained in y. That's consistent with TPP(x,y). But if x touches z's boundary, and z doesn't touch y's boundary (since NTPP(z,y)), then x doesn't touch y's boundary through z. But we know that x does touch y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)). The only way this can be consistent is if x touches y's boundary at a point that is not through z. But that means that x is not completely contained in z, which contradicts TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Is this possible? If x is contained in z, and z is contained in y, then x is contained in y. That's consistent with TPP(x,y). But if x doesn't touch z's boundary, and z doesn't touch y's boundary (since NTPP(z,y)), then x doesn't touch y's boundary. But that contradicts TPP(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPP(z,x). If z is contained in x, and x is contained in y, then z is contained in y. That's consistent with NTPP(z,y). If z touches x's boundary, that's also consistent with NTPP(z,y), as long as z doesn't touch the part of x's boundary that is also y's boundary. And if x touches y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)), that's also consistent with TPP(z,x). So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x). If z is contained in x, and x is contained in y, then z is contained in y. That's consistent with NTPP(z,y). If z doesn't touch x's boundary, that's also consistent with NTPP(z,y). And if x touches y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)), that's also consistent with NTPP(z,x). So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): This means that x and z are equal, i.e., they occupy the same space. If x = z, then TPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y) must both be true. But TPP(x,y) means that x touches y's boundary, while NTPP(z,y) means that z doesn't touch y's boundary. If x = z, then x touches y's boundary if and only if z touches y's boundary. But we're told that x does touch y's boundary and z doesn't, which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check the TPPi(x,z) case. TPPi(x,z) means that TPP(z,x), which means that z is a tangential proper part of x. That is, z is a proper part of x, and z touches x's boundary.

We know that TPP(x,y), which means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is a proper part of y, and x touches y's boundary.

We also know that NTPPi(y,z), which means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch y's boundary.

Now, if TPP(z,x), then z is a proper part of x. And if x is a proper part of y, then z is a proper part of y (by transitivity). This is consistent with NTPP(z,y).

If z touches x's boundary, it's either touching the part of x's boundary that is also y's boundary, or it's touching a part of x's boundary that is in the interior of y. If z touches the part of x's boundary that is also y's boundary, then z touches y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(z,y). So z can only touch the parts of x's boundary that are in the interior of y.

Let's try to draw a picture. Imagine y is a square. Let x be a smaller square inside y, with one edge of x on the boundary of y. That's TPP(x,y). Now, let z be a shape inside x, touching one of the edges of x that is not on the boundary of y. Then z is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)), but z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(z,y)).

This picture works. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

OK, now let me double-check the NTPPi(x,z) case. NTPPi(x,z) means that NTPP(z,x), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, z is a proper part of x, and z does not touch x's boundary.

We know that TPP(x,y), which means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is a proper part of y, and x touches y's boundary.

We also know that NTPPi(y,z), which means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch y's boundary.

Now, if NTPP(z,x), then z is a proper part of x. And if x is a proper part of y, then z is a proper part of y (by transitivity). This is consistent with NTPP(z,y).

If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then it certainly doesn't touch y's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(z,y).

Let's try to draw a picture. Imagine y is a square. Let x be a smaller square inside y, with one edge of x on the boundary of y. That's TPP(x,y). Now, let z be an even smaller square inside x, not touching x's boundary. That's NTPP(z,x). And since z doesn't touch x's boundary, it certainly doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(z,y) as well.

This picture works. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

OK, so the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, I need to carefully check the DC(x,z) case one more time.

DC(x,z) means that x and z are disconnected. We know that both x and z are proper parts of y. We also know that x touches y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)), and z doesn't touch y's boundary (since NTPP(z,y)).

Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? Let's try to draw a picture. Imagine y is a square. Let x be a strip along one edge of the square. That's TPP(x,y). Now, let z be a square in the interior of y, not touching y's boundary. That's NTPP(z,y). If z is far enough from x, then x and z can be disconnected.

This picture works. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

OK, so the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z). 

Let me check EC(x,z) as well. EC(x,z) means that x and z externally connect, i.e., they touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

We know that both x and z are proper parts of y. We also know that x touches y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)), and z doesn't touch y's boundary (since NTPP(z,y)).

Is it possible for x and z to externally connect? Let's try to draw a picture. Imagine y is a square. Let x be a strip along one edge of the square. That's TPP(x,y). Now, let z be a square in the interior of y, not touching y's boundary. That's NTPP(z,y). If z touches x at a single point or along a boundary, but they don't overlap, then x and z externally connect.

This picture works. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

Finally, let me check PO(x,z). PO(x,z) means that x and z partially overlap, i.e., they share some parts but neither is a part of the other.

We know that both x and z are proper parts of y. We also know that x touches y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)), and z doesn't touch y's boundary (since NTPP(z,y)).

Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap? Let's try to draw a picture. Imagine y is a square. Let x be a strip along one edge of the square, and extending a bit into the interior. That's TPP(x,y). Now, let z be a square in the interior of y, not touching y's boundary. That's NTPP(z,y). If z overlaps with the part of x that's in the interior of y, but neither is contained in the other, then x and z partially overlap.

This picture works. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm realizing I've been making a mistake. I've been thinking of NTPPi(y,z) as NTPP(z,y), but that's not right. NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, y is a proper part of z, and y does not touch z's boundary.

So let me restart this. We're given that TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is a proper part of y, and x touches y's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That is, y is a proper part of z, and y does not touch z's boundary.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z.

Since y is a proper part of z, and x is a proper part of y, we know that x is a proper part of z (by transitivity). So the possible relations are: TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

Let's figure out which one it is. If x touches y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)), and y doesn't touch z's boundary (since NTPPi(y,z)), then does x touch z's boundary? No, because to touch z's boundary, x would have to either touch it directly, or touch it through y. But y doesn't touch z's boundary, so x can't touch z's boundary through y. And x is contained in y, so it can't touch z's boundary directly.

So x doesn't touch z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z).

OK, so the answer is: NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, let me try to draw a picture to make sure. Imagine z is a big square. Let y be a smaller square inside z, not touching the boundary of z. That's NTPP(y,z). Now, let x be an even smaller square inside y, touching y's boundary. That's TPP(x,y). Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, we have that x is inside z. But x doesn't touch z's boundary, because y separates x from z's boundary. So x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

This picture works. So the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I've been making a mistake. I've been assuming that if x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z. But that's not necessarily true in this spatial context.

Actually, that is true. The parthood relation is transitive. If x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z. So if x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z.

So the question is just whether x touches z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)), and y doesn't touch z's boundary (since NTPPi(y,z)), then does x touch z's boundary? No, because to touch z's boundary, x would have to either touch it directly, or touch it through y. But y doesn't touch z's boundary, so x can't touch z's boundary through y. And x is contained in y, so it can't touch z's boundary directly.

So the answer is: NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, I'm still confused about the meaning of the relations. Let me reread the problem statement.

DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts. OK, that's clear.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. OK, that's clear.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. OK, that's clear.

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. OK, that's clear.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. OK, that's clear.

TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). OK, so this means that y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x). OK, so this means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Finally, EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident. OK, that's clear.

OK, so we have TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

So both x and z are parts of y. But x touches y's boundary, while z doesn't. So x and z are different regions within y.

Now let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means that x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. Is this possible? Yes, if x is a region near the boundary of y and z is a region in the interior of y, far from x. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): This means that x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Is this possible? Yes, if x is a region that touches y's boundary and z is a region in the interior of y that touches x but doesn't overlap with it. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): This means that x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Is this possible? Yes, if x is a region that touches y's boundary and extends into the interior of y, and z is a region in the interior of y that overlaps with x but neither is contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): This means that x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? If x is contained in z, and z is contained in y, then x is contained in y. That's consistent with TPP(x,y). But if x touches z's boundary, and z doesn't touch y's boundary (since NTPP(z,y)), then x doesn't touch y's boundary through z. But we know that x does touch y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)). The only way this can be consistent is if x touches y's boundary at a point that is not through z. But that means that x is not completely contained in z, which contradicts TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Wait, let me rethink that. TPP(x,z) means that x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible?

We know that TPP(x,y), which means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. We also know that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

So z is a proper part of y. If x is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of y (by transitivity). That's consistent with TPP(x,y).

But if x touches y's boundary (since TPP(x,y)), and z doesn't touch y's boundary (since NTPP(z,y)), then x touches a part of y's boundary that z doesn't touch. But if x is contained in z, that's not possible. So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, that doesn't work. I need to be more careful. Let me try another approach.

TPP(x,z) means that x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Let's think about this case in terms of a diagram.

Imagine y is a square. Let z be a circle inside y, not touching the boundary of y. That's NTPP(z,y). Now, can we have a region x such that TPP(x,y) and TPP(x,z)? TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. TPP(x,z) means that x is part of z and touches z's boundary.

If x is part of z, then x is contained within z. But z doesn't touch y's boundary. So x, being contained within z, can't touch y's boundary either. But that contradicts TPP(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means that x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Is this possible?

We know that TPP(x,y), which means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. We also know that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's think about this case in terms of a diagram.

Imagine y is a square. Let z be a circle inside y, not touching the boundary of y. That's NTPP(z,y). Now, can we have a region x such that TPP(x,y) and NTPP(x,z)? TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. NTPP(x,z) means that x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

If x is part of z, then x is contained within z. But z doesn't touch y's boundary. So x, being contained within z, can't touch y's boundary either. But that contradicts TPP(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means that z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Is this possible?

We know that TPP(x,y), which means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. We also know that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's think about this case in terms of a diagram.

Imagine y is a square. Let x be a region inside y, touching y's boundary. That's TPP(x,y). Now, can we have a region z such that NTPP(z,y) and TPP(z,x)? NTPP(z,y) means that z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary. TPP(z,x) means that z is part of x and touches x's boundary.

If z is part of x, and x is part of y, then z is part of y (by transitivity). That's consistent with NTPP(z,y).

If z touches x's boundary, that doesn't necessarily mean that z touches y's boundary. It depends on which part of x's boundary z touches. If z touches a part of x's boundary that is also y's boundary, then z touches y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(z,y). But if z touches a part of x's boundary that is in the interior of y, then z doesn't touch y's boundary, which is consistent with NTPP(z,y).

So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation, as long as z only touches the parts of x's boundary that are in the interior of y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means that z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Is this possible?

We know that TPP(x,y), which means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. We also know that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's think about this case in terms of a diagram.

Imagine y is a square. Let x be a region inside y, touching y's boundary. That's TPP(x,y). Now, can we have a region z such that NTPP(z,y) and NTPP(z,x)? NTPP(z,y) means that z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary. NTPP(z,x) means that z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

If z is part of x, and x is part of y, then z is part of y (by transitivity). That's consistent with NTPP(z,y).

If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then it certainly doesn't touch y's boundary. That's consistent with NTPP(z,y).

So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): This means that x and z are coincident. Is this possible?

We know that TPP(x,y), which means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. We also know that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

If x = z, then TPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y) must both be true. But TPP(x,y) means that x touches y's boundary, while NTPP(z,y) means that z doesn't touch y's boundary. If x = z, then x touches y's boundary if and only if z touches y's boundary. But we're told that x does touch y's boundary and z doesn't, which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, let me summarize the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This is possible if x is a region near the boundary of y and z is a region in the interior of y, far from x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This is possible if x is a region that touches y's boundary and z is a region in the interior of y that touches x but doesn't overlap with it.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x is a region that touches y's boundary and extends into the interior of y, and z is a region in the interior of y that overlaps with x but neither is contained in the other.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is a region inside x, touching a part of x's boundary that is in the interior of y.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is a region inside x, not touching x's boundary.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what constraints the given relations impose on the possible relationship between x and z.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is a part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

So both x and z are parts of y, but x touches y's boundary while z doesn't. Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected. For example, x could be a region near y's boundary while z is a region in y's interior, with space between them.

2. EC(x,z): x and z can externally connect. For example, x could be a region touching y's boundary that just touches z at a single point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap. For example, x could be a region that both touches y's boundary and extends into y's interior where it partially overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were a part of z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, then x couldn't touch y's boundary either.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This works if z touches the interior boundary of x but not the part of x that touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This works if z is fully contained within x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, they would have to both touch or both not touch y's boundary, but we know one does and one doesn't.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
