PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that y is part of x, and z is part of y, it follows that z is also part of x. This is due to the transitivity of the "part of" relation. But what kind of part is z of x?

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, z does not touch y's boundary. And since y is a tangential proper part of x, y touches x's boundary. These two facts together mean that z must not touch x's boundary. If it did, it would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(y,z).

So, z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. This corresponds to the NTPP relation, i.e., NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Let's double-check this. We have:
- y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- z is a proper part of y (from NTPP(y,z)).
- Therefore, z is a proper part of x.
- y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)).
- z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)).
- Therefore, z doesn't touch x's boundary.

This confirms that the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me check this more rigorously. If z did touch x's boundary, there would be a point p in both z and the boundary of x. Since z is a subset of y, p would also be a point in y. So p would be a point in both y and the boundary of x. But since y is a tangential proper part of x, there is already at least one point in both y and the boundary of x. This would mean z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts the fact that z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Hmm, I think my reasoning above is not quite right. Let's be more careful. The fact that z is a proper part of y means that z is a subset of y. The fact that y is a tangential proper part of x means that y is a subset of x and y intersects the boundary of x. And the fact that z is a non-tangential proper part of y means that z is a subset of y and z does not intersect the boundary of y.

Now, the boundary of y includes both points that are on the boundary of x and points that are not. Since z doesn't intersect the boundary of y, it doesn't intersect either of these sets of points.

So we have:
- z is a subset of y (from NTPP(y,z)).
- y is a subset of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- Therefore, z is a subset of x.
- z doesn't intersect the boundary of y (from NTPP(y,z)).
- The boundary of y includes all points in y that are on the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- Therefore, z doesn't intersect the boundary of x.

This confirms that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, now I realize that I was sloppy with some of my variables. Let me redo my reasoning being more careful:

In TPPi(x,y), x is the "whole" and y is the "part", so y is a tangential proper part of x.
In NTPP(y,z), y is the "whole" and z is the "part", so z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

OK, so we have:
- y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is a proper part of y and z does not touch the boundary of y.

From these, we can deduce:
- z is a proper part of y (from NTPP(y,z)).
- y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- Therefore, z is a proper part of x.

Now, the question is: does z touch the boundary of x?

The fact that z is a non-tangential proper part of y means that z doesn't touch the boundary of y. The fact that y is a tangential proper part of x means that y touches the boundary of x. 

Ah, there's a potential confusion because "tangential" and "non-tangential" are about whether the part touches the boundary of the whole. TPP (tangential proper part) means the part touches the boundary of the whole, while NTPP (non-tangential proper part) means the part doesn't touch the boundary of the whole.

So, to be clearer:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, the fact that z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y could include points that are on the boundary of x, doesn't necessarily mean that z doesn't touch the boundary of x. It's possible for z to touch the boundary of x at points where y doesn't.

Actually, that's wrong. Let me think more carefully:

- z is a proper part of y, which means every point in z is also in y.
- y is a proper part of x, which means every point in y is also in x.
- So, every point in z is also in x, confirming that z is a proper part of x.

Now, for a point to be on the boundary of a region, it must be in the region and adjacent to a point outside the region. If z doesn't touch the boundary of y, then every point in z is surrounded by points of y. 

Given that y is a tangential proper part of x, there are points in y that are on the boundary of x. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, all points in z are surrounded by points of y. This means that z can't touch the boundary of x.

Wait, let me be even more careful:

Consider a point p in z. Since z is a subset of y, p is also in y. Now, if p were on the boundary of x, then p would be adjacent to a point outside of x. But since p is surrounded by points of y (as z doesn't touch the boundary of y), and all points of y are in x, p can't be adjacent to a point outside of x. Therefore, p can't be on the boundary of x.

This means that z doesn't touch the boundary of x, confirming that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I've just realized I've been misinterpreting the variables in the problem. I need to be careful about which variables correspond to which regions. Let me restart.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): This means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(y,z): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So:
- y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

This is actually not as straightforward as I initially thought. Let's reason geometrically:

- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- y is also inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given this, z must extend beyond y. And since y touches the boundary of x, there's a part of z that overlaps with x.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC (Disconnected): This is not possible because y is a part of both x and z, so x and z share at least part of y.

2. EC (Externally Connected): This is not possible for the same reason as DC; x and z overlap due to y.

3. PO (Partially Overlapping): This is possible. x and z could overlap at y, but both x and z could extend beyond this overlap.

4. TPP (Tangential Proper Part): This is possible. x could be a proper part of z and touch the boundary of z.

5. NTPP (Non-Tangential Proper Part): This is possible. x could be a proper part of z and not touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi (Tangential Proper Part Inverse): This is possible. z could be a proper part of x and touch the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi (Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse): This is not possible. If z were a non-tangential proper part of x, then z would be entirely inside x and not touch the boundary of x. But then, y, which is a part of z, would not touch the boundary of x, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ (Equal): This is not possible. If x and z were equal, then y would either touch the boundary of both or touch the boundary of neither, contradicting the given conditions.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Actually, wait. Let me double-check by considering the constraints more carefully.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is a proper part of z and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let's think about the possible configurations:

1. x and z are unrelated (DC or EC): This is not possible because y is a part of both x and z, so there's an overlap.

2. x and z partially overlap (PO): This is possible. y could be in the overlap region.

3. x is a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP): 
   - TPP: x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. y is inside both x and z, x touches the boundary of z, and y touches the boundary of x but not z.
   - NTPP: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. y is inside both x and z, x is entirely inside z, and y touches the boundary of x but not z.

4. z is a proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi):
   - TPPi: z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. y is inside both x and z, z touches the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of x but not z.
   - NTPPi: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible. If z were entirely inside x and didn't touch the boundary of x, and y were inside z, then y would not touch the boundary of x, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

5. x and z are equal (EQ): This is not possible. If x and z were equal, then y would either touch the boundary of both or touch the boundary of neither, contradicting the given conditions.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Actually, I need to double-check the TPPi case. Let's see:

In the TPPi case, z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely inside x and touches the boundary of x. And y is a proper part of z.

From TPPi(x,y), y touches the boundary of x. Since y is inside z, and z touches the boundary of x, this is consistent.

From NTPP(y,z), y doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means y is entirely inside z.

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Now, let's check if I've correctly analyzed all the cases. The question asks for the possible relationships between x and z.

From the constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Analyzing the possible relationships:
1. DC(x,z): Not possible. y is a part of both x and z, so they must share at least y.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as DC.
3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z could partially overlap, with y in the overlap region.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were a non-tangential proper part of x, then y, which is inside z, would not touch the boundary of x, contradicting TPPi(x,y).
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, then y, which is a tangential proper part of x, would also be a tangential proper part of z, contradicting NTPP(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Actually, let me also double check the TPP case. 

In the TPP case, x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely inside z and touches the boundary of z.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given that x touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, it might seem that y should also touch the boundary of z, contradicting NTPP(y,z). But this is not necessarily the case. It's possible for x to touch the boundary of z at a point that's not in y. So, TPP(x,z) is consistent with the constraints.

Hmm, wait. Let me think about this more carefully.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y touches the boundary of x.
From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y does not touch the boundary of z.

Let's now consider the TPP case, where x is a tangential proper part of z.

In this case, x touches the boundary of z. But from the constraints, y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z. This suggests that the part of x that touches the boundary of z must not overlap with y.

Is this possible? Yes, it is. Even if y touches the boundary of x, it doesn't have to touch the entire boundary. There can be parts of the boundary of x that y doesn't touch. And it's these parts that can touch the boundary of z.

So, the TPP case is consistent with the constraints. My analysis of the possible relationships between x and z stands: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Ah, I see an issue with my analysis of the PO case.

PO means that x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This means there are parts of x that are outside of z, and there are parts of z that are outside of x.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's think about the PO case. If x and z are in a PO relationship, and y is a part of both x and z, then y must be in the overlap region. Since y is a non-tangential proper part of z, it must not touch the boundary of z. But since y is a tangential proper part of x, it must touch the boundary of x.

Is it possible for y to touch the boundary of x but not the boundary of z, while x and z are in a PO relationship? Yes, it is. The boundary of x includes points that are inside z (since x and z overlap) and points that are outside of z. y can touch the boundary of x at a point that's inside z, and not touch the boundary of z.

So, the PO case is also consistent with the constraints. My final analysis of the possible relationships between x and z remains: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Alright, let me double-check each of these four possibilities:

1. PO(x,z):
   - Means: x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
   - TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
   - NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - Consistency: In the overlap region of x and z, y can be situated such that it touches the boundary of x at a point that's inside z, but doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is possible, so PO(x,z) is consistent with the constraints.

2. TPP(x,z):
   - Means: x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches the boundary of z.
   - TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
   - NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - Consistency: x can touch the boundary of z at a point that's not in y. y can touch the boundary of x at a point that's not on the boundary of z. This is possible, so TPP(x,z) is consistent with the constraints.

3. NTPP(x,z):
   - Means: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
   - NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - Consistency: x can be completely inside z, and y can touch the boundary of x while still being inside z and not touching the boundary of z. This is possible, so NTPP(x,z) is consistent with the constraints.

4. TPPi(x,z):
   - Means: z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
   - TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
   - NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - Consistency: z can be inside x and touch the boundary of x. y can be inside z and not touch the boundary of z, while still touching the boundary of x. This is possible, so TPPi(x,z) is consistent with the constraints.

So, all four relationships (PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi) are possible.

Actually, I'm concerned about the NTPP(x,z) case. Let's revisit it:

If NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, from TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y touches the boundary of x.

From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, and y is inside x, then y also doesn't touch the boundary of z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

And if y touches the boundary of x, and x is entirely inside z, then this doesn't contradict any of the conditions. y touches the boundary of x, but not the boundary of z, because x itself doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

However, I'm still not entirely convinced of my analysis. Let me try a slightly different approach, using the constraints of the relations more directly.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x and y intersects the boundary of x.
From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper part of z and y doesn't intersect the boundary of z.

Now, let's see which RCC-8 relations between x and z are consistent with these constraints:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is inconsistent because y is a part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is inconsistent for the same reason as DC; y is a part of both x and z, so they must share more than just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is a part of the other. This is consistent if y is in the overlap region, y touches the boundary of x, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is consistent if x touches the boundary of z at a point that's not in y, and y touches the boundary of x at a point that's not on the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is consistent if x doesn't touch the boundary of z, y touches the boundary of x, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is consistent if z touches the boundary of x, y touches the boundary of x, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is inconsistent because if z doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is a part of z, then y also doesn't touch the boundary of x, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is inconsistent because if x and z are the same, then y is both a tangential proper part of x and a non-tangential proper part of x (since it's a non-tangential proper part of z, which is the same as x). This is a contradiction.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Great, we have the same result from two different approaches, which increases my confidence in the analysis.

Actually, let me try a third approach, just to be triple sure.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. Let's denote the boundary of x as ∂x. Then, y ⊂ x and y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅.
From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. Let's denote the boundary of z as ∂z. Then, y ⊂ z and y ∩ ∂z = ∅.

Now, let's check each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): This means x ∩ z = ∅. This is inconsistent because y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, so y ⊂ x ∩ z, which means x ∩ z ≠ ∅.

2. EC(x,z): This means the interiors of x and z are disjoint, but their boundaries touch. This is inconsistent for the same reason as DC; y is a part of both the interior of x and the interior of z, so the interiors cannot be disjoint.

3. PO(x,z): This means x ∩ z ≠ ∅, x ⊄ z, and z ⊄ x. This is consistent if y ⊂ x ∩ z, y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅, and y ∩ ∂z = ∅.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x ⊂ z and x ∩ ∂z ≠ ∅. This is consistent if y ⊂ x ⊂ z, y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅, and y ∩ ∂z = ∅.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x ⊂ z and x ∩ ∂z = ∅. This is consistent if y ⊂ x ⊂ z, y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅, and y ∩ ∂z = ∅.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z ⊂ x and z ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅. This is consistent if y ⊂ z ⊂ x, y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅, and y ∩ ∂z = ∅.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z ⊂ x and z ∩ ∂x = ∅. This is inconsistent because if z ∩ ∂x = ∅ and y ⊂ z, then y ∩ ∂x = ∅, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x = z. This is inconsistent because if x = z, then y ⊂ x = z, y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅, and y ∩ ∂z = ∅. But ∂x = ∂z if x = z, so this is a contradiction.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Great, all three approaches give the same result. I'm confident that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Let me just double check the NTPP(x,z) case once more:

If NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then any point in x is not on the boundary of z. If y touches the boundary of x, that doesn't contradict y not touching the boundary of z, because the boundary of x is not the same as the boundary of z. In fact, the boundary of x is entirely inside z, since x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me also double check the TPPi(x,z) case:

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If z is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y is inside z, then y is also inside x. The fact that y doesn't touch the boundary of z doesn't contradict y touching the boundary of x, because the boundary of z is not the same as the boundary of x. Parts of the boundary of x can be touched by y without being on the boundary of z, even if z touches the boundary of x at other points.

So, TPPi(x,z) is also possible.

Let me double check the TPP(x,z) case:

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches the boundary of z.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If x is inside z and touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x, then y is also inside z. The fact that y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z might seem contradictory if x touches the boundary of z. But the boundary of x is not the same as the boundary of z. Parts of the boundary of x that are touched by y can be entirely inside z, even if other parts of the boundary of x touch the boundary of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is also possible.

Finally, let me double check the PO(x,z) case:

If PO(x,z), then x and z overlap, but neither is contained within the other. This means there are parts of x that are not in z, and parts of z that are not in x.

From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

From NTPP(y,z), y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If x and z overlap, and y is inside both x and z, then y is in the overlap region. The fact that y touches the boundary of x but not the boundary of z is consistent because the boundary of x includes points that are inside z and points that are outside of z. y can touch the boundary of x at a point that's inside z, and not touch the boundary of z.

So, PO(x,z) is also possible.

I've confirmed that all four relationships (PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi) are consistent with the constraints, and the other four RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, NTPPi, and EQ) are inconsistent with the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Actually, I'm still not 100% confident about the NTPP case, let me think about it from a different angle.

If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. From TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y touches the boundary of x.

Let's denote the interior of a region r as int(r) and the boundary of r as ∂r. For NTPP(x,z), we have x ⊂ int(z), which means every point in x is an interior point of z.

For TPPi(x,y), we have y ⊂ x and y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅, which means y touches the boundary of x. And for NTPP(y,z), we have y ⊂ int(z), which means every point in y is an interior point of z.

Now, let's consider a point p ∈ y ∩ ∂x. Such a point exists because y touches the boundary of x. Since p ∈ y and y ⊂ int(z), we have p ∈ int(z). But p is also on the boundary of x, which is entirely inside the interior of z (since x ⊂ int(z)). So, a point can be both on the boundary of x and in the interior of z, which is consistent.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

And so my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Actually, let me try to summarize this a bit more directly.

We have that TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is a proper subset of x, and y touches the boundary of x.

We also have NTPP(y,z), i.e., y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is a proper subset of z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Thus, we know:
1. y is a proper subset of x.
2. y touches the boundary of x.
3. y is a proper subset of z.
4. y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let's check the RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, because y is a subset of both x and z, so they must share at least part of y.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as DC.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can overlap at y, but both x and z can extend beyond this overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a proper subset of z and touch the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a proper subset of z and not touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a proper subset of x and touch the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were a proper subset of x and didn't touch the boundary of x, then y, which is a subset of z, wouldn't touch the boundary of x, contradicting condition 2.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were the same, then y would be a tangential proper part of z (since it's a tangential proper part of x), contradicting condition 4.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

Actually, let me think once more about the TPP case.

We have:
1. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper subset of x and y touches the boundary of x.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper subset of z and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is a proper subset of z and x touches the boundary of z.

Now, y is a subset of x, which is a subset of z, so y is also a subset of z, which is consistent with condition 3.

But if x touches the boundary of z, and y is a subset of x, doesn't that mean y might also touch the boundary of z, contradicting condition 4?

Not necessarily. The fact that y is a subset of x means every point in y is also in x. But not every point in x has to be in y (since y is a proper subset of x). The points where x touches the boundary of z might not be part of y, in which case y wouldn't touch the boundary of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is consistent with the constraints.

Great. So indeed, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, and TPPi.

So the answer is: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi.

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), I'll analyze what these initial relations tell us:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

2. NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now let me check each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

- DC(x,z): Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share space.

- EC(x,z): Not possible for the same reason - they must share interior points.

- PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap with y in the overlapping region.

- TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z, where x touches z's boundary at points not in y.

- NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

- TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x, where z touches x's boundary.

- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (which is inside z) couldn't touch x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

- EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, y would have to both touch and not touch the boundary of the same region, which is contradictory.
