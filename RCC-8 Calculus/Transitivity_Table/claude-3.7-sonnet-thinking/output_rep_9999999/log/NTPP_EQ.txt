PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this. I have two given relations:
1. NTPP(x,y): This means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is fully inside y without touching y's boundary.
2. EQ(y,z): This means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are the same spatial region. That means any relation that x has with y, x will also have with z. 

Given NTPP(x,y), x is a non-tangential proper part of y. Since y and z are equivalent (EQ(y,z)), x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPP(x,z) must hold.

Let me double-check this:
- x is strictly inside y without touching y's boundary (NTPP(x,y))
- y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z))
- Therefore, x must be strictly inside z without touching z's boundary, which is NTPP(x,z)

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this more carefully to make absolutely sure:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same region.

Since y and z are the same, they have the same boundaries and the same interior. Since x is inside y without touching y's boundary, x must also be inside z without touching z's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

To verify: If we had a different relationship between x and z, say TPP(x,z), that would mean x touches z's boundary. But since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), y and z have the same boundary. So if x touched z's boundary, it would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts our given NTPP(x,y). Similar contradictions arise for all other possible relationships except NTPP(x,z).

So, the final answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

Let me think through this step-by-step:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary)

2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), they have identical boundaries and interiors. This means that any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), and y is identical to z, then x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
