PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think through this carefully.

We have TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. That means y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.

We also have NTPPi(y,z), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That means z is contained in y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now let's figure out the possible relationships between x and z. 

Given that y is contained in x, and z is contained in y, we know that z is contained in x. So that means z is a proper part of x.

The question is whether z touches x's boundary or not.

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it does not touch y's boundary. And since y touches x's boundary, z doesn't necessarily touch x's boundary. 

Actually, let's be more precise. If z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, that means z is separated from x's boundary by at least a little bit of y. So z does not touch x's boundary.

That means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be careful here. Let me draw a picture. 

x is the large outer region. y is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch y's boundary.

So I have:
TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is contained in y and does not touch y's boundary.

Wait, I realize that I've been interpreting the TPPi relation incorrectly. Let me get it straight.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). So y is a tangential proper part of x. That means y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). So z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That means z is contained in y and does not touch y's boundary.

So the situation is:
- y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- z is contained in y and does not touch y's boundary.

Since z is contained in y, and y is contained in x, we have that z is contained in x. So z is a proper part of x.

And since z does not touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So we have NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm getting confused with the notation. Let me work it out more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) is defined as TPP(y,x). TPP(y,x) means "y is a tangential proper part of x". So y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) is defined as NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means "z is a non-tangential proper part of y". So z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's put these together:
- y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, we have that z is a proper part of x.

Does z touch the boundary of x? Given the constraints, I can't say for sure. If z touches a part of the boundary of x that isn't also part of the boundary of y, then z would be a tangential proper part of x. Otherwise, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me clarify one more time. TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.

But I made another error. TPP(y,x) means "y is a proper part of x AND y touches the boundary of x". It's not saying that y is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary; it's saying that y is a proper part of x, and additionally, y touches x's boundary.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, we have that z is a proper part of x.

Now, can z touch the boundary of x?

Since z does not touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, there are two possibilities: either z doesn't touch the boundary of x, or it does but only at points where y doesn't touch the boundary of x.

But since y is a proper part of x, the boundary of y includes parts that are inside x, not just parts that are on the boundary of x. And since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, it means z is separated from both the parts of y's boundary that are inside x and the parts that are on the boundary of x.

So z cannot touch the boundary of x, making z a non-tangential proper part of x. Hence, NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm still getting confused because I'm mixing up the direction of the relations. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the relations correctly.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x).
TPP(y,x) means "y is a tangential proper part of x".
"y is a tangential proper part of x" means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y).
NTPP(z,y) means "z is a non-tangential proper part of y".
"z is a non-tangential proper part of y" means z is a proper part of y and z does not touch the boundary of y.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Okay, so z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x. The question is, does z touch the boundary of x?

Since z does not touch the boundary of y, z is "insulated" from the boundary of y. This means z is also insulated from the boundary of x, because to touch the boundary of x, z would have to extend to the boundary of y (since y is a proper part of x). But z doesn't touch the boundary of y, so it can't touch the boundary of x.

So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, but I think I'm not thinking about this quite right. Let's think through it differently.

Actually, wait. I think I'm overthinking this. I should just apply the relationships directly. We have:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). So y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). So z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since y is a tangential proper part of x, it means y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.
Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it means z is contained completely within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, let's think about the relationship between x and z. We know that z is contained within y, and y is contained within x. So z is contained within x, which means either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

TPP(z,x) would mean z touches the boundary of x. But since z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y might only touch x's boundary at certain points, it's not guaranteed that z touches the boundary of x. In fact, z is separated from the boundary of x by at least a part of y. So the relationship cannot be TPP(z,x).

NTPP(z,x) would mean z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Since z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary, it means z is separated from the boundary of y by a non-zero distance. Given that y touches the boundary of x (but doesn't necessarily overlap it entirely), z is also separated from the boundary of x by a non-zero distance. So the relationship is NTPP(z,x).

Alternatively, NTPPi(x,z) is the same as NTPP(z,x). So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I'm overthinking it because I'm confusing myself by the notation. Let me think more directly and geometrically.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Let's visualize:
- x is the outermost region.
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at some points.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y at any point.

Given this, z is inside x (because z is inside y and y is inside x). And since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, that's not right. Let me be more precise. 

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So now:
- y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Let's visualize it:
x is the outermost region.
y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x. The question is: does z touch the boundary of x?

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x but doesn't necessarily coincide with it everywhere, z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is because to touch the boundary of x, z would have to extend to the part of y that touches the boundary of x, but z doesn't even touch the boundary of y.

So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x). Equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

But I made a mistake earlier. I was thinking "TPP" means a part touches the boundary, but that's not quite right. TPP means a tangential proper part, which means it's a proper part (i.e., not equal to the whole) and it touches the boundary.

So, TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is properly contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is properly contained in y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z.

We know:
- y is properly contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is properly contained in y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

From this, we can deduce that z is properly contained in x (since z is in y and y is in x). But does z touch the boundary of x?

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x but doesn't necessarily coincide with it everywhere, z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is because to touch the boundary of x, z would have to extend to the part of y that touches the boundary of x, but z doesn't even touch the boundary of y.

So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x). Equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I'm still confusing myself. Let's take a step back.

We are given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), and we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

But I think I previously erred in interpreting these. Let me double-check:

- TPP(y,x) means y is a proper part of x and y shares at least one point with the boundary of x.
- NTPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y and z doesn't share any points with the boundary of y.

Now, for TPPi(x,y):
TPPi(x,y) = TPP(y,x)
This means y is a proper part of x and y shares at least one point with the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(y,z):
NTPPi(y,z) = NTPP(z,y)
This means z is a proper part of y and z doesn't share any points with the boundary of y.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of x and y shares at least one point with the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y and z doesn't share any points with the boundary of y.

From these, we can deduce that z is a proper part of x (since z is a part of y and y is a part of x). But does z share any points with the boundary of x?

Since z doesn't share any points with the boundary of y, and y shares at least one point with the boundary of x but doesn't necessarily coincide with the boundary of x everywhere, z doesn't share any points with the boundary of x. This is because to share a point with the boundary of x, z would have to extend to a point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of x, but z doesn't touch the boundary of y at all.

So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x). Equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, let me double-check. 

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, y is a proper part of x and shares at least one point with the boundary of x. z is a proper part of y and doesn't share any points with the boundary of y.

Can z share any points with the boundary of x? That would require z to extend to a point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of x. But since z doesn't share any points with the boundary of y, it can't share any points with the boundary of x either.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or, equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize that there might be multiple answers. Let me explore.

We have:
- y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

z is definitely a proper part of x. But the question is: does z touch the boundary of x?

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is a proper part of x, z definitely doesn't touch the boundary of x at the points where y touches the boundary of x. But could z touch the boundary of x elsewhere?

Hmm, but that wouldn't make sense given the constraints. If z is a proper part of y, then z is entirely contained within y. And if z doesn't touch the boundary of y, then z is "buffered" from the outside world by y. So there's no way for z to touch the boundary of x without first touching the boundary of y, which we know it doesn't.

So we can confidently say that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, hold on. Let me make sure I haven't missed any subtleties.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper part of x and shares at least one point with the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y and doesn't share any points with the boundary of y.

Given these, z is definitely a proper part of x. The question is whether z can share any points with the boundary of x.

For z to share a point with the boundary of x, z would need to extend to a point on the boundary of x. But since z is a proper part of y and doesn't share any points with the boundary of y, and y is a proper part of x, z can't extend to the boundary of x without first crossing the boundary of y, which we know it doesn't.

So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Ah, I think I'm confusing myself because of the multiple interpretations of TPPi and NTPPi.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x). TPP(y,x) means "y is a tangential proper part of x."
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means "z is a non-tangential proper part of y."

"y is a tangential proper part of x" means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
"z is a non-tangential proper part of y" means z is a proper part of y and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a proper part of y and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

I think a major source of my confusion was the direction of the TPPi and NTPPi relations. Let's be very explicit:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, we have:
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Visually, think of x as the outermost shape, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and z is inside y but doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

We know z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z is inside x. The question is: does z touch the boundary of x?

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x without first touching the boundary of y. But z doesn't touch the boundary of y, so z can't touch the boundary of x.

So z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x). Equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Ok, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's actually just derive the answer.

We're given:

TPPi(x, y)
NTPPi(y, z)

By definition, TPPi(x, y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

By definition, NTPPi(y, z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now, we want to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x. So x and z are not disconnected, not touching, not overlapping, and not equal. That means the relationship must be one of: TPP(z, x), NTPP(z, x), TPPi(x, z), or NTPPi(x, z).

Since z is inside x, TPPi(x, z) means the same as TPP(z, x), and NTPPi(x, z) means the same as NTPP(z, x). So we need to determine whether z is a tangential proper part of x or a non-tangential proper part of x.

If z is a tangential proper part of x, it means z touches the boundary of x. But for z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to touch the boundary of y first (since y is inside x and z is inside y). But we know z doesn't touch the boundary of y, so z can't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is not a tangential proper part of x.

Instead, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z, x) or equivalently NTPPi(x, z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, one second. Let me check if there's any way that TPPi(x, z) could be a possible relationship.

TPPi(x, z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

For z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to touch the boundary of y at a point that also lies on the boundary of x. But we know z doesn't touch the boundary of y at all. So, z can't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, TPPi(x, z) is not a possible relationship.

Let me check for the remaining relationships:

NTPP(x, z) would mean that x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. But we know z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, x can't be inside z.
Therefore, NTPP(x, z) is not a possible relationship.

TPP(x, z) would mean that x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. But we know z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, x can't be inside z.
Therefore, TPP(x, z) is not a possible relationship.

PO(x, z) would mean that x and z overlap, but neither is inside the other. But we know z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, z is inside x, which contradicts the definition of PO.
Therefore, PO(x, z) is not a possible relationship.

EC(x, z) would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But we know z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, z is inside x, which contradicts the definition of EC.
Therefore, EC(x, z) is not a possible relationship.

DC(x, z) would mean that x and z are disconnected. But we know z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, z is inside x, which contradicts the definition of DC.
Therefore, DC(x, z) is not a possible relationship.

EQ(x, z) would mean that x and z are equal. But we know z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, z is a proper part of x, which contradicts the definition of EQ.
Therefore, EQ(x, z) is not a possible relationship.

So, after checking all possibilities, we find that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z) or equivalently NTPP(z, x).

Now, I'm more confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

Wait, let me just double-check one more time. I've been assuming all along that z is a proper part of x. But that's already ruling out some possibilities.

Actually, let's reconsider. Given:

TPPi(x, y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

This implies:
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

I want to determine the relationship between x and z.

I'll consider all eight possible relations.

EC(x, z) would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, z is inside x, which means they overlap. Therefore, EC(x, z) is not possible.

DC(x, z) would mean that x and z are disconnected. But z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, z is inside x, which means they are connected. Therefore, DC(x, z) is not possible.

PO(x, z) would mean that x and z overlap, but neither is inside the other. But z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, z is inside x, which contradicts the definition of PO. Therefore, PO(x, z) is not possible.

TPP(x, z) would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z. But z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, z is inside x, which contradicts the definition of TPP(x, z). Therefore, TPP(x, z) is not possible.

NTPP(x, z) would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, z is inside x, which contradicts the definition of NTPP(x, z). Therefore, NTPP(x, z) is not possible.

EQ(x, z) would mean that x and z are equal. But z is inside y, and y is inside x. If z is inside y and y is inside x, then z can't be equal to x unless both y and z are equal to x. But since y is a proper part of x, y is not equal to x. Therefore, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

TPPi(x, z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be inside x and touch the boundary of x. We know z is inside x (because z is inside y and y is inside x). But does z touch the boundary of x? For z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to extend to a point on the boundary of y that is also on the boundary of x. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y (as per NTPPi(y, z)), z can't touch the boundary of x. So, z is not a tangential proper part of x. Therefore, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x, z) would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be inside x and not touch the boundary of x. We know z is inside x (because z is inside y and y is inside x). And we just determined that z can't touch the boundary of x. So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x, z) is possible.

After checking all possibilities, we find that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

So my final answer is NTPPi(x, z) is the relationship between x and z.

Actually, let me be even more precise, and just enumerate all possible relationships between x and z, given the constraints.

Given:
- TPPi(x, y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary.

From these, we can derive:
- z is inside y, and y is inside x. So, z is inside x.
- z does not touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x. Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, z can't touch the boundary of x.

Now, let's go through all eight relations to see which ones are possible:

1. DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z is inside x.

2. EC(x, z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is not possible because z is inside x, so they overlap.

3. PO(x, z): x and z overlap, but neither is inside the other. This is not possible because z is inside x.

4. TPP(x, z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is not possible because z is inside x, so x can't be a part of z.

5. NTPP(x, z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is not possible for the same reason as above.

6. TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is not possible because for z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would have to touch the boundary of x. But we've determined that z can't touch the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x, z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z is a proper part of x, not equal to x.

So, after exhaustively checking all possibilities, we confirm that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step by step.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Considering the relationship between x and z:
- Since z is contained within y, and y is contained within x, we know z is contained within x.
- Does z touch the boundary of x? For z to touch x's boundary, z would need to extend to the boundary of y at a point where y touches x's boundary. But we know z doesn't touch y's boundary at all.
- Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Since z is properly contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
