PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the relationships we know:
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. So x is completely contained within y, and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now we need to figure out what relationship could hold between x and z. Let's go through the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - externally connected
3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part
5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part
6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part (i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x)
7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part (i.e., z is a non-tangential proper part of x)
8. EQ(x,z) - equal

Given that NTPP(x,y), we know that x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. And given that EC(y,z), we know that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Since x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary without overlapping, it seems like x and z must be disconnected, i.e., DC(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning:
- x is strictly inside y, away from the boundary
- z touches y only at the boundary
- So x and z cannot share any points (if they did, those points would be both in x and in z, but x is strictly inside y and z is strictly outside y except at the boundary, so they can't share points)
- Therefore, x and z must be disconnected, i.e., DC(x,z)

Actually, let's be even more careful here. We know that:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundary, but their interiors don't overlap

Given these conditions, what are the possible relations between x and z?

If y and z touch only at their boundary (EC), and x is strictly inside y (NTPP), then x can't overlap with z because z doesn't overlap with y's interior. And x can't touch z at a boundary because x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary.

So the only possible relation between x and z is that they are disconnected, i.e., DC(x,z).

Let me reason once more to be sure:

NTPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y
- x does not touch y's boundary

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share any interior points

So, x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary. And z is outside y, only touching y at the boundary. This means x and z cannot touch or overlap, as x is strictly inside y and z is strictly outside y (except at the boundary, which x doesn't touch).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

Actually, wait. Let me carefully think about this one more time. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, away from the boundary of y.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch only at their boundaries.

Can x and z overlap? No, because x is strictly inside y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y.

Can x and z touch at their boundaries? No, because x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary.

So x and z must be disconnected, which means DC(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, I realize I made a mistake. I said that DC(x,z) means that x is strictly outside z, but that's not right. DC(x,z) means that x and z don't share any points, including boundary points.

Let me go through the reasoning more carefully:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
2. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Given these constraints, x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while z touches y only at the boundary. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, x and z can't touch or overlap.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

Actually, let me take a more methodical approach to this problem. I'm going to explicitly think through whether each of the 8 RCC relations is possible for x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected
Since x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, x and z don't share any points. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected
For x and z to be externally connected, they would need to touch at their boundaries. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, x and z can't touch. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
For x and z to partially overlap, they would need to share some interior points. But since z doesn't share any interior points with y (it only touches y at the boundary), and x is completely inside y, x and z can't share any interior points. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But since x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, x can't be inside z at all. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part
For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. But since x is completely inside y, and z only touches y at the boundary, x can't be inside z at all. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But since z is outside y except at the boundary, and x is completely inside y, z can't be inside x at all. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part
For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. But since z is outside y except at the boundary, and x is completely inside y, z can't be inside x at all. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal
For x and z to be equal, they would need to be exactly the same region. But since x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z touches y at the boundary and is otherwise outside y, x and z can't be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

After going through all 8 RCC relations, I've determined that the only possible relation between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

Actually, I want to re-examine whether the "tangential proper part" (TPP) relation is possible between x and z. 

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's consider a specific scenario: Imagine y is a circle, x is a smaller circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z is a bigger circle that touches y at exactly one point on their boundaries.

In this scenario, it's not possible for x to be completely inside z, because x is inside y, and z is outside y except at the boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's consider a different scenario: Imagine y is a circle, x is a smaller circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z is a shape that wraps around y, touching y at the boundary but also extending to include a region that contains x.

In this case, z could potentially contain x, but it would still need to respect the constraint that y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. Since x is in the interior of y, and z can't share interior points with y, x can't be in z.

So, it seems like TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Actually, I want to think about the EC(y,z) relation a bit more carefully. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. However, this doesn't mean that z is completely outside y except at the boundary. It means that the interiors of y and z don't intersect, but it's possible for z to "wrap around" y in a way that could potentially allow x to be inside z.

For example, imagine y is a donut shape (a torus), x is a small circle inside the hole of the donut, and z is a shape that touches the outer edge of the donut but also fills the hole of the donut, including the region where x is.

In this case, we have:
- NTPP(x,y) because x is completely inside the donut y (in the hole) and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) because y and z touch at the outer edge of the donut, but their interiors don't overlap.
- But now, x is completely inside z, and since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it also doesn't touch z's boundary. So we have NTPP(x,z).

Actually, no, this doesn't work. If x is in the hole of the donut y, then x is not inside y at all, so we wouldn't have NTPP(x,y).

Let me try again. The issue is that I'm having trouble visualizing a scenario where NTPP(x,y), EC(y,z), and anything other than DC(x,z) all hold simultaneously.

Let me use a different approach. Given NTPP(x,y), we know that x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Given EC(y,z), we know that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't have overlapping interiors.

Now, for any relation other than DC(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to either touch or overlap. But since x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z doesn't overlap with y's interior, x and z can't touch or overlap.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

Actually, let me take a step back. Maybe I'm being a bit too restrictive in my understanding of EC(y,z). Let's revisit the definition:

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

This allows for various configurations, including ones where z "wraps around" y in some way, as long as their interiors don't overlap.

Let me think of a specific example. Imagine y is a solid circle, x is a smaller solid circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z is a "C" shape that touches y at one point on their boundaries.

In this case, we have:
- NTPP(x,y) because x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) because y and z touch at one point on their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap.
- DC(x,z) because x is completely inside y, and z is outside y except at the one point where they touch, so x and z don't share any points.

This example confirms that DC(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

But could there be a different configuration where a relation other than DC(x,z) holds? Let's try to construct one.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to partially overlap. For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to touch at their boundaries.

But in all these cases, z would need to overlap with y's interior, because x is completely inside y. And if z overlaps with y's interior, then EC(y,z) wouldn't hold.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

Actually, let's try a different approach to this problem. I'm going to think about the composition table for RCC-8 relations, which gives us the possible relations R(x,z) given R1(x,y) and R2(y,z).

According to the composition table for RCC-8, if NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), then the possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

This confirms my reasoning above, that given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is: DC(x,z).

Hm, actually, I'm realizing that I don't have the composition table for RCC-8 at my disposal, so I'd need to derive the answer directly, which is what I've been trying to do.

Let me use a more general approach. When we have NTPP(x,y), we know that x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. When we have EC(y,z), we know that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't have overlapping interiors.

Given these constraints, x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, while z is outside y except at the boundary where they touch. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, x and z can't touch. And since z doesn't overlap with y's interior, and x is completely inside y, x and z can't overlap.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

Actually, I think I should try to examine scenarios more thoroughly. Let's consider some potential configurations:

1. y is a circle, x is a smaller circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z is a shape that touches y at the boundary.
   - NTPP(x,y) holds because x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
   - EC(y,z) holds because y and z touch at the boundary but don't have overlapping interiors.
   - What's the relation between x and z? Since x is completely inside y, and z is outside y except at the boundary, x and z don't share any points. So DC(x,z) holds.

2. y is a circle, x is a smaller circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z is a "C" shape that wraps around y, touching y at one point on the boundary.
   - NTPP(x,y) holds because x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
   - EC(y,z) holds because y and z touch at one point on the boundary but don't have overlapping interiors.
   - What's the relation between x and z? Again, since x is completely inside y, and z is outside y except at the boundary, x and z don't share any points. So DC(x,z) holds.

I can't think of a configuration where anything other than DC(x,z) would hold, given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Therefore, the answer is: DC(x,z).

Wait, let me reconsider. I think one important point that I've been neglecting is the possibility of z "wrapping around" y in a way that could allow a different relation between x and z.

For example, imagine y is a solid circle, x is a smaller solid circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z is a "horseshoe" shape that touches y at two points on the boundary and wraps around y to form a sort of enclosure.

In this case, we have:
- NTPP(x,y) because x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) because y and z touch at two points on the boundary, but their interiors don't overlap.

What's the relation between x and z? x is completely inside y, and z is outside y except at the boundary. So x and z don't share any points, which means DC(x,z) holds.

OK but now I'm thinking about another configuration. Let's think about a 3D scenario: 

Imagine y is a solid sphere, x is a smaller solid sphere completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z is a "shell" that completely surrounds y, touching y at the boundary, but not the space inside y.

In this case, we have:
- NTPP(x,y) because x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) because y and z touch at the boundary, but their interiors don't overlap.

What's the relation between x and z? x is completely inside y, and z surrounds y but doesn't penetrate y's interior. So x and z don't share any points, which means DC(x,z) holds.

OK let me just think about it the right way to make sure I don't miss anything. I think the fundamental constraint is this:

NTPP(x,y) means x is in the interior of y.
EC(y,z) means y and z don't share interior points.

So, the interior of y and the interior of z don't overlap, because y and z are externally connected (EC). But x is in the interior of y. So x can't be in the interior of z, because if it were, then the interiors of y and z would overlap, contradicting EC(y,z).

Since x is in the interior of y, and doesn't touch the boundary of y, x can't touch z, because z only touches y at the boundary.

So x and z don't touch, and they don't overlap. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

So now I'm confident that the correct answer is: DC(x,z).

Actually, I should take a step back and try to be more methodical. Given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), I'm trying to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let's try to systematically rule out impossible relations.

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside the interior of y.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries, but don't share interior points.

Let's go through each of the 8 RCC-8 relations and determine if it's possible for x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected
   For this to be false, x and z would need to share at least one point. But x is in the interior of y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y (it only touches y at the boundary). So x and z can't share any points, which means DC(x,z) must be true.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected
   For this to be true, x and z would need to touch at their boundaries. But x is in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary. So x and z can't touch, which means EC(x,z) can't be true.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
   For this to be true, x and z would need to share some interior points. But x is in the interior of y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y. So x and z can't share any interior points, which means PO(x,z) can't be true.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part
   For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But since x is in the interior of y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y, x can't be inside z. So TPP(x,z) can't be true.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part
   For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. But since x is in the interior of y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y, x can't be inside z. So NTPP(x,z) can't be true.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But since z touches y at the boundary and doesn't share any interior points with y, and x is in the interior of y, z can't be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) can't be true.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. But since z touches y at the boundary and doesn't share any interior points with y, and x is in the interior of y, z can't be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) can't be true.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal
   For this to be true, x and z would need to be exactly the same region. But since x is in the interior of y, and z touches y at the boundary and doesn't share any interior points with y, x and z can't be the same region. So EQ(x,z) can't be true.

After ruling out all other possibilities, I've determined that the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

Therefore, the answer is: DC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by reasoning through a specific example. Imagine:
- y is a solid circle
- x is a smaller solid circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- z is a solid circle outside y, touching y at one point on the boundary

In this case:
- NTPP(x,y) holds because x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z) holds because y and z touch at one point on the boundary, but their interiors don't overlap.
- What's the relation between x and z? Since x is completely inside y, and z is outside y except at the boundary, x and z don't share any points. So DC(x,z) holds.

This example confirms that DC(x,z) is indeed a possible relation. And my systematic analysis above shows that it's the only possible relation.

Therefore, the answer is: DC(x,z).

Actually, I'm realizing that all of my reasoning uses the assumption that the RCC-8 relations are being applied to simple regions in 2D or 3D space. But the RCC-8 calculus is more general than that, and can be applied to any topological space. Let me reconsider the problem in this more general context.

In a general topological space, given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), what are the possible relations between x and z?

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside the interior of y.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries, but don't share interior points.

For any relation other than DC(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to either touch or overlap. But since x is completely inside the interior of y, and z doesn't share any interior points with y, x and z can't touch or overlap.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z), which means they are disconnected.

So my answer is: DC(x,z).

OK I've triple-checked this and I'm confident the answer is DC(x,z). Let me just double-check once more that I understand the question correctly:

We are given:
NTPP(x,y) - This means x is completely inside the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
EC(y,z) - This means y and z touch at their boundaries, but don't share interior points.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Given these constraints:
- x is completely inside the interior of y
- z touches y only at the boundary
- Therefore, x and z can't share any points
- So, DC(x,z) holds, meaning x and z are disconnected.

This is the only possible relation between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

So the answer is: DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the implications of NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) to determine what relationship(s) can exist between x and z.

First, let's understand what we know:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Let me systematically analyze whether each possible RCC-8 relation could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Since x is strictly in the interior of y (not touching y's boundary), and z only touches y at the boundary (with no overlap of interiors), x and z cannot share any points. They must be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): For this to be true, x and z would need to touch at their boundaries. But x doesn't touch y's boundary, so it can't touch z either.

3. PO(x,z): This would require x and z to share interior points. But z doesn't share interior points with y, and x is entirely in y's interior, so this is impossible.

4. TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z): Both would require x to be inside z, which is impossible since x is in y's interior and z doesn't share interior points with y.

5. TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z): Both would require z to be inside x, which is impossible since z extends outside of y.

6. EQ(x,z): This would require x and z to be identical, which contradicts our constraints.

After examining all possibilities, only one relation is possible.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
