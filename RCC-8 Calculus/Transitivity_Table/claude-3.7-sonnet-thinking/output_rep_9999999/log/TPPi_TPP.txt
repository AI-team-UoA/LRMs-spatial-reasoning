PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. That is, y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z): This means that y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given these constraints.

Let's think about this spatially. 

If y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y)), then x contains y and they share a boundary point.
If y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then z contains y and they share a boundary point.

So, we have:
- x contains y
- z contains y
- y touches the boundary of x
- y touches the boundary of z

Now, what could be the relationship between x and z?

1. x and z could be disconnected (DC). This can't be the case because they both contain y, so they must share at least y.
2. x and z could externally connect (EC). This can't be the case either because they both contain y, so they must share more than just a boundary point.
3. x and z could partially overlap (PO). This is possible. x and z share y, but it's possible that neither is a proper part of the other.
4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP). This means x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible if x is contained within z and touches the boundary of z.
5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP). This means x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch the boundary of z. This doesn't seem possible because y touches the boundary of both x and z, so if x is contained within z, then x must also touch the boundary of z (via y).
6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi). This means z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible if z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi). This means z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch the boundary of x. This doesn't seem possible because y touches the boundary of both x and z, so if z is contained within x, then z must also touch the boundary of x (via y).
8. x and z could be equal (EQ). This means x and z are the same region. This is possible.

Wait, I need to reconsider some of these. Let me think more carefully.

Actually, let's approach this problem more systematically. In the RCC-8 calculus, the composition of two relations can be determined using a composition table. The composition TPPi ∘ TPP gives the possible relations that can hold between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

From a standard RCC-8 composition table, the composition TPPi ∘ TPP = {PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ}.

So, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

Let's double-check this. 

If x and z are equal (EQ), then y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, which is consistent with the given conditions.

If x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP), then y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, which is consistent.

If z is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi), then y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, which is consistent.

If x and z partially overlap (PO), then y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, which is consistent.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, wait, I think I made an error above. Let me think about this again by trying to reason about specific examples.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. This means that y is inside z and touches the boundary of z.

Given these, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

1. x and z could be disconnected (DC). This can't be the case because they both contain y, so they must share at least y.
2. x and z could externally connect (EC). This can't be the case either because they both contain y, so they must share more than just a boundary point.
3. x and z could partially overlap (PO). This is possible. x and z share y, but it's possible that neither is a proper part of the other.
4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP). This means x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible. Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z that touches the boundary of z, and y as an even smaller circle inside x that touches the boundary of x and the boundary of z at the same point.
5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP). This means x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is possible. Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle completely inside z without touching its boundary, and y as an even smaller circle inside x that touches the boundary of x and extends to touch the boundary of z.

Wait, that doesn't work. If y touches the boundary of x and y is inside z, then y can't touch the boundary of z unless that boundary coincides with the boundary of x at that point. But then x would touch the boundary of z, making it a TPP, not an NTPP. So, NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Let's continue:

6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi). This means z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. This is possible. Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside x that touches the boundary of x, and y as an even smaller circle inside z that touches the boundary of z and the boundary of x at the same point.
7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi). This means z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch the boundary of x. This isn't possible for similar reasons as why NTPP(x,z) isn't possible.
8. x and z could be equal (EQ). This means x and z are the same region. This is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Hmm, I said that NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible. But actually, I think it might be. 

Imagine:
- x is a circle
- y is a crescent shape that touches the boundary of x at one point
- z is a larger circle that completely contains x without touching it, and y touches the boundary of z at one point.

In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are satisfied, and NTPP(x,z) holds.

Actually, wait. I'm not sure if the scenario I described is possible. If y touches the boundary of x and y is inside z, then for y to also touch the boundary of z, the boundary of z must pass through y. But if z completely contains x without touching it (NTPP), then the boundary of z must be outside of x, which means y can't touch both the boundary of x and the boundary of z.

I think my reasoning above was correct, and NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible because if y touches the boundary of z and y is inside x, then for y to also touch the boundary of x, the boundary of x must pass through y. But if x completely contains z without touching it (NTPPi), then the boundary of x must be outside of z, which means y can't touch both the boundary of x and the boundary of z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, wait. I think I've been overthinking this. Let's use the composition table for RCC-8 directly.

The composition TPPi ∘ TPP gives the possible relations that can hold between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

From a standard RCC-8 composition table, the composition TPPi ∘ TPP = {PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}.

So, according to the composition table, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

Hmm, my reasoning above doesn't match the composition table. Let me rethink my examples.

Actually, I think the composition table is correct and I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let's see if I can come up with valid examples for each of the possible relations.

1. PO(x,z):
   - x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 2.
   - z is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 2.
   - y is a small circle centered at (1,0) with radius 0.5.
   - In this scenario, y touches the boundary of both x and z, and is a proper part of both. x and z partially overlap.

2. TPP(x,z):
   - z is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3.
   - x is a circle centered at (1,0) with radius 1.
   - y is a small circle centered at (1.5,0) with radius 0.5.
   - In this scenario, y touches the boundary of both x and z, and is a proper part of both. x is a tangential proper part of z.

3. NTPP(x,z):
   - z is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 4.
   - x is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 2.
   - y is a crescent shape inside x that touches the boundary of x at one point and extends to touch the boundary of z at one point.
   - In this scenario, y touches the boundary of both x and z, and is a proper part of both. x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Hmm, the NTPP scenario I described might not work because if y is a proper part of x, then y can't extend outside of x to touch the boundary of z. Let me rethink this.

Actually, I think NTPP(x,z) might not be possible with the given constraints. Let me try to argue it systematically:

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is inside z and touches the boundary of z.

Now, if NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

But we know that y touches the boundary of z and y is inside x. This implies that the boundary of z must pass through x, which contradicts the assumption that x doesn't touch the boundary of z (NTPP).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

By a similar argument, NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

Let's go back to the composition table. I think I might have been thinking of a different composition or made a mistake in recalling the table.

For RCC-8, the composition TPPi ∘ TPP = {PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ}.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

This matches my reasoning, so I'm more confident in this answer.

Let's finalize, using the accepted RCC-8 composition tables from the literature, if TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

ANSWER:

Let me work through this step by step.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to consider how these regions can be arranged:

1. Since y is part of both x and z, they cannot be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC).

2. Since y touches the boundary of both x and z, this creates constraints on how x and z can relate.

The possible relationships are:

- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap (they share y, but neither is completely contained in the other)
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary)
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal

NTPP and NTPPi are not possible because if y touches both boundaries, then x and z must also touch at their boundaries if one contains the other.
