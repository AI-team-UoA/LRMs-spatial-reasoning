PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this carefully. We have:
- TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z), which means y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region).

Now I need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), we can substitute z for y in any relation. So if TPPi(x,y), then TPPi(x,z) would also hold.

Wait, I need to be careful here. TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part inverse of y, which is equivalent to TPP(y,x), meaning y is a tangential proper part of x.

So we have:
- TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident

Since y and z are coincident, z must have the same relationship with x as y does. So if y is a tangential proper part of x, then z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, TPP(z,x) must hold, which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

So the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Hmm, let me double check this. 

We have:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region.

So z is the same region as y, and y is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. Therefore, z must also be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary.

This means TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

The answer is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me triple check this with a more methodical approach.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): x is a tangential proper part inverse of y, which means y is a tangential proper part of x
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident

When two regions are coincident, they are identical in terms of their spatial extent. So any spatial relationship that holds between y and another region will also hold between z and that region.

Since y is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(y,x)), and y is coincident with z (EQ(y,z)), z must also be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)).

So the relationship between x and z is TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step by step:

1) TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)

2) EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since y and z occupy exactly the same space (they are equivalent), and y is a tangential proper part of x, then z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is TPP(z,x), which is equivalently written as TPPi(x,z).
