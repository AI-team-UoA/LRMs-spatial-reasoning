PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. 

Given:
- PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap (they share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other).
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).

I need to determine the possible relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), we know that y and z are essentially the same region. This means any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that PO(x,y), and y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), it follows that x must also partially overlap with z.

So the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).

Let me verify this:
- PO(x,y) means x and y share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region.
- Therefore, x and z must share the same spatial parts that x and y share, and neither is completely contained in the other.

This confirms that PO(x,z) is the relationship between x and z.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully.

The EQ relation is essentially an identity relation in the spatial domain. If EQ(y,z), then for all practical purposes in the RCC-8 calculus, y and z are interchangeable.

So if PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then we can substitute z for y in the first relation, giving us PO(x,z).

So the answer is that the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Wait, let me just double-check my understanding of the RCC-8 relations again:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they share no spatial parts).
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points).
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other).
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and touches y's boundary).
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y but doesn't touch y's boundary).
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal (they occupy the same space).

Yes, the EQ relation indicates that y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident.

Since y and z are coincident (they are the same region), any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Therefore, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

Let me check once more:

If two regions y and z are exactly the same (EQ(y,z)), then any third region x will have the same relationship with both y and z. So if x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), then x must also partially overlap with z (PO(x,z)).

So the answer is: PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine what relationship must hold between x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same region in space, they are spatially identical. Therefore, any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), and z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), it follows that x must also partially overlap with z.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
