{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "I need to determine what relationship can hold between x and z given the information:\n- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (exactly the same spatial region)\n- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts\n\nSince EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same spatial entity, x must have the same relationship with z that y has with z. If y is externally connected to z, then x must also be externally connected to z.\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 16.300638437271118, "reasoning-tokens": 1201, "completion-tokens": 1201}
