{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given:\n- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (occupy exactly the same spatial region)\n- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other)\n\nSince EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical spatial regions, x must have exactly the same relationship with z that y has with z. \n\nSince y partially overlaps with z, x must also partially overlap with z.\n\n### Answer: PO(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 8.694003343582153, "reasoning-tokens": 496, "completion-tokens": 496}
