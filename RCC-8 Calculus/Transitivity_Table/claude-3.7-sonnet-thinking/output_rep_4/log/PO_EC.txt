PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). We want to find all possible relationships between x and z.

First, let me recall what these relations mean:
- PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is completely part of the other.
- EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

Let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is positioned in such a way that it overlaps with y but is completely separated from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond y and overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. This seems unlikely given that x partially overlaps with y and y only externally connects with z. If x is completely in z, it wouldn't be possible for x to overlap with y while y only touches z externally.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This seems even less likely for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained in x and does not touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This seems unlikely because if x and z were the same, then y would have the same relationship with both, which contradicts PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me reconsider these more carefully.

Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), let's visualize this:

- y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap in their interiors.
- x partially overlaps with y, sharing some interior points.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x only overlaps with parts of y that don't touch z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches z at a boundary but doesn't overlap with z.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x overlaps with parts of z. This could happen if x extends beyond the part of y that touches z.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y only externally connects with z, it's hard to imagine a scenario where x is completely inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This seems unlikely for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. This is possible if x is large enough to contain z and parts of y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Again, this is possible if x is large enough.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they would need to occupy the same space. Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), this seems contradictory, as y would have different relations with the same region.

Hmm, I realize I'm struggling a bit to be precise in my reasoning. Let's try a different approach. Let's consider the spatial structure of the scenario.

Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points but not all. There are parts of x that are not in y, and parts of y that are not in x.

Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior points.

Now, let's consider the position of x relative to z:

1. If x only overlaps with parts of y that don't touch z, then x and z can be disconnected, so DC(x,z) is possible.

2. If x overlaps with parts of y that touch z at the boundary, then x and z can touch at the boundary, so EC(x,z) is possible.

3. If x extends beyond y and into z, then x and z can partially overlap, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. Could x be completely inside z? Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y only externally connects with z, it seems that for x to be completely inside z, x would have to be very specific - only in the part of y that touches z. But that would make x touch z's boundary, which doesn't seem possible given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) don't seem possible.

5. Could z be completely inside x? If z is small enough and x is large enough, then z could be completely inside x, either touching x's boundary (TPPi(x,z)) or not (NTPPi(x,z)).

6. Could x and z be equal? If x and z were the same, then y would have the same relationship with both, which contradicts PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

I'm still not entirely confident in my reasoning for some of these. Let me think further.

Actually, I think I'm making things too complicated. Let's reason more directly.

Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points but not all. There are parts of x that are not in y, and parts of y that are not in x.

Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior points.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x only overlaps with parts of y that don't touch z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x overlaps with parts of y that touch z at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond y and into z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y only externally connects with z, it's hard to see how x could be completely inside z. So, I don't think TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For similar reasons as TPP, I don't think NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained in x and does not touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This isn't possible because if x and z were the same, then y would have the same relationship with both, which contradicts PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Actually, I still have a bit of doubt about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let me reconsider this more carefully.

Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points but not all.
Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior points.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. The challenge here is to reconcile this with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

If x is completely inside z and y only touches z at the boundary, then x can only partially overlap with y if part of y extends into z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Again, this contradicts the given constraints. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's reconsider TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z), z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. This is possible if x is large enough to contain z and also overlap with y.

For NTPPi(x,z), z must be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is also possible if x is large enough.

Let me make sure about these.

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, it's still possible for y to touch z at the boundary and also partially overlap with x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, it's still possible for y to touch z at the boundary and also partially overlap with x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let's review our findings:

DC(x,z): Possible
EC(x,z): Possible
PO(x,z): Possible
TPP(x,z): Not possible
NTPP(x,z): Not possible
TPPi(x,z): Possible
NTPPi(x,z): Possible
EQ(x,z): Not possible

But hold on, I want to double-check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. Now, for PO(x,y) to be true, x and y must share some interior points but not all. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z at the boundary, then y can extend beyond z and partially overlap with x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

However, for NTPPi(x,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If z doesn't touch x's boundary but y touches z at the boundary, then y would be inside x (at least where it touches z). For PO(x,y) to be true, y must partially overlap with x, which means it can extend beyond x. But if y touches z at the boundary and z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y must go from touching z inside x to extending outside x. This seems geometrically strange and I'm unsure if it's possible. Let me reconsider.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating. If z is non-tangentially contained in x, it means there's a "buffer" region of x surrounding z. y can touch z at the boundary and still partially overlap with x by extending into this buffer region. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think I'm struggling with this. Let's try again.

I need to identify the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior points but not all.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's reason through each of the 8 possible relations systematically:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x only overlaps with parts of y that don't touch z. For instance, imagine a scenario where y is a large region, and x overlaps with y on the left, while z touches y on the right. In this case, x and z can be completely separated.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x overlaps with parts of y that touch z at the boundary. For instance, imagine a scenario where x extends beyond y on the side where y touches z. In this case, x and z can touch at a boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond y and into z. For instance, imagine a scenario where y is sandwiched between x and z, with x overlapping y on one side and z on the other. In this case, x and z can share some interior points but not all.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. If x is inside z and y only touches z at the boundary, then it's hard to see how x and y can share interior points. So, TPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For similar reasons as TPP, NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, it's still possible for y to touch z at the boundary and also partially overlap with x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. The question is: can y touch z at the boundary, extend beyond z, and still have PO(x,y)? I believe this is possible. Imagine a small region z deep inside a larger region x, and a region y that touches z at the boundary and extends outward, partially overlapping with x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means x and z occupy the same space. Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), if x and z were the same, then y would have both PO(x,y) and EC(x,y), which is a contradiction since these are mutually exclusive. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually I think my reasoning for NTPPi(x,z) is still not clear. Let me try to visualize it.

Imagine a small circle z in the middle of a larger circle x. For NTPPi(x,z), z should be completely inside x and not touching x's boundary. Now, for EC(y,z), y touches z at the boundary. And for PO(x,y), y and x should partially overlap.

So, y touches z at the boundary and extends in some direction. As y extends, it can either stay completely inside x or extend beyond x. If y stays completely inside x, then y would be a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, y must extend beyond x, making PO(x,y) possible.

In this scenario, z is completely inside x (NTPP), y touches z at the boundary (EC), and y partially overlaps with x (PO). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let's review our findings:

DC(x,z): Possible
EC(x,z): Possible
PO(x,z): Possible
TPP(x,z): Not possible
NTPP(x,z): Not possible
TPPi(x,z): Possible
NTPPi(x,z): Possible
EQ(x,z): Not possible

Actually, I want to double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries.

Let's imagine a scenario: z is a large circle, and x is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary. y is another circle that touches z at the boundary. If y touches z at the same point where x touches z, then y and x can share a small region, making PO(x,y) possible. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

However, I'm not sure if this reasoning is correct, because if y is externally connected to z, and x is inside z, it seems like y can't really share interior points with x unless y also goes inside z, which would contradict EC(y,z).

Actually, let me use a more specific visualization: Think of a filled semicircle x, which is a tangential proper part of a filled circle z. Now place a filled circle y such that it touches the filled circle z externally, precisely at the point where the straight edge of the semicircle x touches the boundary of the filled circle z. In this arrangement, the filled circle y and the filled semicircle x share some interior points, but neither is inside the other, so they're in a PO relation. Meanwhile, the filled circle y and the filled circle z are externally connected.

So I think TPP(x,z) might be possible after all. Let me think more carefully.

OK, I'm confusing myself. Let me start over with a clearer approach.

I have PO(x,y), meaning x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
I have EC(y,z), meaning y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's go through each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x only overlaps with parts of y that don't touch z. For instance, y could be a large region, and x overlaps with y on the left, while z touches y on the right.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x extends to the boundary of y where y touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond y and into z. For instance, y could be a buffer zone between x and z, with x overlapping y on one side and z on the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. If x is inside z and y only touches z at the boundary, then it's hard to see how x and y can share interior points without y also entering z, which would contradict EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For similar reasons as TPP, NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, it's still possible for y to touch z at the boundary and also partially overlap with x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If z is completely inside x and y touches z at the boundary, then y must penetrate x to touch z. As long as y isn't completely inside x, PO(x,y) is satisfied. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means x and z occupy the same space. Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), if x and z were the same, then y would have both PO(x,y) and EC(x,y), which is a contradiction since these are mutually exclusive. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

But I think I really do need to reconsider the possibility of TPP(x,z). Let's try a specific example.

Imagine a circle z, with a semicircle x inside it such that the straight edge of the semicircle touches the circle's boundary. Now, place another circle y such that it touches the circle z at the same point where the straight edge of the semicircle x touches the circle's boundary. In this scenario, x and y can share a small region, making PO(x,y) possible. Meanwhile, x is a tangential proper part of z, and y is externally connected to z.

Hmm, but in this scenario, y would have to enter z to overlap with x, which would contradict EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Actually, let me try to reason about this systematically. I already know that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are true.

If TPP(x,z) is true, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. Since x is completely inside z, for y to share interior points with x, y must enter z. But this would contradict EC(y,z), which states that y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, if NTPP(x,z) is true, then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, for y to share interior points with x, y must enter z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

If TPPi(x,z) is true, then z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, y can touch z at the boundary and also extend beyond z to partially overlap with x. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

If NTPPi(x,z) is true, then z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y must penetrate x to touch z. As long as y isn't completely inside x, PO(x,y) is satisfied. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

If EQ(x,z) is true, then x and z are the same region. Given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), if x and z were the same, then y would have both PO(x,y) and EC(x,y), which is a contradiction since these are mutually exclusive. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

If DC(x,z) is true, then x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x only overlaps with parts of y that don't touch z. For instance, y could be a large region, and x overlaps with y on the left, while z touches y on the right.

If EC(x,z) is true, then x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible if x extends to the boundary of y where y touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary point.

If PO(x,z) is true, then x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other. This is possible if x extends beyond y and into z, or if z extends beyond y and into x.

I think my reasoning is now consistent, and the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, I want to check my reasoning for PO(x,z). If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points but neither is completely inside the other. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points but neither is completely inside the other.

In a scenario where x and z partially overlap, x and z share a region. If y touches z at the boundary and also overlaps with x, then y can extend from touching z into the region of x that doesn't overlap with z. This seems geometrically possible. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me try one more time with a super systematic approach.

I have PO(x,y), meaning x and y share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.
I have EC(y,z), meaning y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

I want to determine which of the 8 RCC-8 relations can possibly hold between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This means x and z share no points at all.
   Is this possible? Yes. Consider a scenario where y is a large region, and x overlaps with y on the left, while z touches y on the right. In this case, x and z can be completely separated.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
   Is this possible? Yes. Consider a scenario where x extends to the boundary of y where y touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other.
   Is this possible? Yes. Consider a scenario where x extends beyond y and into z, or z extends beyond y and into x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   Is this possible? If x is completely inside z, then for y to share interior points with x (as PO(x,y) stipulates), y must enter z. But this would contradict EC(y,z), which states that y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   Is this possible? For the same reason as TPP, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
   Is this possible? Yes. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, y can touch z at the boundary and also extend beyond z to partially overlap with x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   Is this possible? Yes. If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y can touch z at the boundary and extend within x. As long as y isn't completely inside x, PO(x,y) is satisfied.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means x and z occupy the same space.
   Is this possible? If x and z are the same, then y would have both PO(x,y) and EC(x,y), which is a contradiction since these are mutually exclusive. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Let me double-check this answer once more.

1. DC(x,z) is possible: x and z can be completely disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) is possible: x and z can touch at a boundary without sharing interior.
3. PO(x,z) is possible: x and z can share interior without one being inside the other.
4. TPP(x,z) is not possible: If x is inside z, y can't overlap with x while only touching z externally.
5. NTPP(x,z) is not possible: Same reasoning as for TPP.
6. TPPi(x,z) is possible: z can be inside x, touching x's boundary, and y can touch z's boundary and overlap with x.
7. NTPPi(x,z) is possible: z can be inside x, not touching x's boundary, and y can touch z's boundary and overlap with x.
8. EQ(x,z) is not possible: y can't both overlap with x and be externally connected to it.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, let me reconsider TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) because I'm unsure if my reasoning is correct.

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries.

I need to check if it's possible for y to overlap with x while only touching z externally.

Imagine a circle z, with a smaller circle x inside it such that x touches z's boundary at a point p. Now, place another circle y such that it touches z at the point p. The question is: can y overlap with x without entering z?

I don't think this is possible. For y to overlap with x, y must share interior points with x. But since x is inside z, for y to share interior points with x, y must enter z. But this would contradict EC(y,z), which states that y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points. So, TPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, for y to share interior points with x, y must enter z, which would contradict EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

I still stand by my conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, let me try one more time for TPP(x,z) since I'm a bit unsure.

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries.

Here's a different way to think about it: Consider a point p that is both on the boundary of x and on the boundary of z. Now, if y touches z at the point p, can y overlap with x? I think the answer is still no. If y touches z at p, then p is also on the boundary of y. But for y to overlap with x, y must share interior points with x. Since p is on the boundary of x, y must extend a bit into x to share interior points. But this means y also extends a bit into z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

And by similar reasoning, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, my conclusion remains the same: the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, let me try to reason about this with a concrete example.

Consider a flat square table x placed on the floor z such that one edge of the table touches the floor. This is a TPP(x,z) relation. Now, imagine a ball y that touches the floor right where the table's edge touches the floor. This is an EC(y,z) relation. The question is: can the ball y overlap with the table x without entering the floor z?

If the ball is placed in such a way that it touches the floor at the point where the table's edge touches the floor, then the ball would also touch the table at that point. But touching doesn't mean overlapping. For the ball to overlap with the table, part of the ball must be inside the table. But since the table is on the floor and the ball is touching the floor at the same point, the ball can't go inside the table without also going inside the floor, which would contradict EC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

I think the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Maybe the problem is I'm thinking too concretely. Let's clarify the core issue: the contradiction arises for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) because if x is a proper part of z (tangential or non-tangential), then for y to have an overlap with x, y must have some interior region in common with x, but by transitivity, this means that y must also have some interior region in common with z, which contradicts the given that EC(y,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, let me verify the PO(x,z) case as well to make sure it's consistent.

For PO(x,z), x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other. Given PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Is it possible for x to overlap with z, y to overlap with x, and y to be externally connected to z?

Yes, this seems possible. For instance, imagine a scenario where x overlaps with z, creating a shared region. y can touch z at the boundary and extend into the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. This way, y overlaps with x, touches z at the boundary, and doesn't enter z.

So, PO(x,z) is possible.

In summary, I think the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Alright, to be absolutely sure, let me try a different approach. I'll think about the compatibility of each relation with the given constraints.

Given: PO(x,y) and EC(y,z)

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is compatible with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). Imagine a ball (representing y) touching a table (representing z) at a point, and a sphere (representing x) overlapping with the ball but not touching the table.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries. This is compatible with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). Imagine a ball (representing y) touching a table (representing z) at a point, and a sphere (representing x) overlapping with the ball and also touching the table at the same point.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points but neither is inside the other. This is compatible with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). Imagine a sphere (representing x) partially above and partially below a table (representing z), and a ball (representing y) touching the table at the edge and overlapping with the part of the sphere that's above the table.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is not compatible with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). If x is inside z, then for y to overlap with x, y must enter z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is not compatible with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is compatible with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). Imagine a small disc (representing z) inside a larger disc (representing x), touching the boundary of the larger disc. A third disc (representing y) touches the small disc at a point and extends beyond it, overlapping with the larger disc.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is compatible with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). Imagine a small disc (representing z) inside a much larger disc (representing x), not touching the boundary of the larger disc. A third disc (representing y) touches the small disc at a point and extends beyond it, overlapping with the larger disc.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is not compatible with PO(x,y) and EC(y,z). If x and z are the same, then y would have to both overlap with x and be externally connected to x, which is a contradiction.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

For each of these:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
3. PO(x,z): x and z share some interior points, but neither is inside the other.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

I'm now confident that the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each potential relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x overlaps with a portion of y that's away from where y touches z, then x and z can be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x extends to the boundary point where y touches z, then x can externally connect with z without sharing interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x partially extends beyond y into z, they can share some interior points without either being completely contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z, then for y to partially overlap with x (as required by PO(x,y)), y would need to enter z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP - y cannot partially overlap with x without entering z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, y can touch z at the boundary and still partially overlap with x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, y can touch z at the boundary and extend within x, creating a partial overlap with x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, y would have both PO(x,y) and EC(z,y) relations with the same region, which is contradictory.
