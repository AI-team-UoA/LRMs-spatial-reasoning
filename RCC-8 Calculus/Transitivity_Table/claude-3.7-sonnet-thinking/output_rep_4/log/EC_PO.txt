PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step. We have two given relations:
1. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, meaning they share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other.

Now we need to determine what relation(s) could hold between x and z. Let's analyze the possible scenarios.

Since EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. Since PO(y,z), y shares some interior with z, but neither is contained in the other.

Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations that might hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x could be disconnected from z, even though x touches y and y overlaps with z. For example, imagine x touching y at the eastern boundary of y, while z overlaps with y on the western part of y, with no contact between x and z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x could touch z at a boundary point. This can happen if the boundary of x touches the boundary of y at a point where y's boundary also meets z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x could share some interior with z. This can happen if part of x overlaps with a part of z, even though x and y are only externally connected.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that x is externally connected to y, and y partially overlaps with z, it seems unlikely that x could be entirely contained within z. However, I need to think more carefully about this. If x is very small and touches y at a point, and z encompasses both that point and more of y, then it's conceivable that x could be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Given that x touches the boundary of y, and y is not contained in z, it's hard to see how x could be completely inside z without touching its boundary. But again, let me think more carefully. If x is inside y, and the part of y that contains x is inside z, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts EC(x,y) which says x touches the boundary of y. So NTPP(x,z) seems impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that z overlaps with y, and y is only externally connected to x, it seems unlikely that z could be entirely contained within x. But let me think more carefully. If z is very small and is contained within the region where y overlaps with x, then z could be a tangential proper part of x. But wait, this contradicts the given relation EC(x,y), which means x and y don't share interior parts. So TPPi(x,z) seems impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that z overlaps with y, and y is only externally connected to x, it seems even less likely that z could be entirely contained within the interior of x. So NTPPi(x,z) seems impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. Given that y overlaps with z but is only externally connected to x, it's not possible for x and z to be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Let me reconsider TPP(x,z) more carefully. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must touch the boundary of z. Now, since EC(x,y), x touches the boundary of y. And since PO(y,z), y and z overlap in their interiors, but neither is contained in the other. It's hard to see how x could be contained in z while also touching the boundary of y, especially since y is not contained in z. So, TPP(x,z) also seems impossible.

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let's draw a diagram to understand this better.

Imagine y as a circle. x is another circle that touches y at a single point (EC relationship). z is a circle that overlaps with y (PO relationship).

Now, depending on where z overlaps with y, x and z can have different relationships:

1. If z doesn't overlap with y at the point where x touches y, then x and z are disconnected (DC).
2. If z overlaps with y and the overlap region includes the point where x touches y, then x and z touch at a point (EC).
3. If z extends beyond y and encompasses part of x, then x and z partially overlap (PO).
4. If z encompasses the entirety of x, and x touches the boundary of z, then x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP).

Wait, I think I've been too restrictive in my thinking. Let's reconsider TPP(x,z):

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must touch the boundary of z. Now, EC(x,y) means x touches y at a boundary. PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other.

It's possible for x to be inside z and touch the boundary of z at a point, while also touching the boundary of y at a different point. So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me also reconsider NTPP(x,z):

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must not touch the boundary of z. Given that x touches the boundary of y (EC(x,y)), and y overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), it's possible for x to be inside z without touching the boundary of z, while also touching the boundary of y. So, NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

Hmm, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let's be more precise. EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. So, x is outside of y except for the boundary point(s) they share.

Given this, if x is outside of y and z overlaps with y, it's not possible for x to be a proper part of z, whether tangential or non-tangential. So, TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

I'm having some difficulty with this. Let me try to visualize it differently.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries. This means x and y share points on their boundaries, but not interior points.

PO(y,z) means y and z overlap. This means y and z share some interior points.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Let's break it down based on where z is in relation to the point(s) where x and y touch:

1. If z doesn't overlap with y at the point where x touches y, then x and z are disconnected (DC).
2. If z overlaps with y and the boundary of z passes through the point where x touches y, then x and z touch at a point (EC).
3. If z overlaps with y and also extends to overlap with x, then x and z partially overlap (PO).

As for TPP(x,z), for this to be true, x would need to be entirely contained within z, with x touching the boundary of z. But since x is outside of y except for the boundary point(s) they share, and z overlaps with y but doesn't fully contain y, it's not possible for z to fully contain x.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible because it would require x to be entirely inside z without touching the boundary of z. But since x is outside of y except for the boundary point(s) they share, it's not possible for x to be entirely inside z without touching the boundary of z.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z would need to be entirely contained within x, with z touching the boundary of x. But since z overlaps with y, and y is outside of x except for the boundary point(s) they share, it's not possible for z to be entirely contained within x.

NTPPi(x,z) is similarly not possible.

EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same region. Given that y overlaps with z but is only externally connected to x, it's not possible for x and z to be the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, and PO.

However, I feel like I might be missing something, so let me reconsider TPP(x,z) one more time.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must touch the boundary of z. Given EC(x,y), x touches the boundary of y but is otherwise outside of y. Given PO(y,z), y and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other.

Can x be inside z in this scenario? Let's think of a concrete example. Imagine y as a large circle and x as a small circle that touches y at a single point. Now, imagine z as a very large circle that encompasses both x and a portion of y. In this case, x would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP).

Wait, I think TPP(x,z) is indeed possible. Let's reconsider:

EC(x,y) means x and y share boundary points, but not interior points.
PO(y,z) means y and z share interior points, but neither is a part of the other.

Now, imagine x as a small circle that touches y at a single point. z is a large circle that overlaps with y and also encompasses x, with x touching the boundary of z. In this case, TPP(x,z) is satisfied.

Ok, so it's possible for x to be entirely within z, touching z's boundary, which would make TPP(x,z) a valid relation.

What about NTPP(x,z)? For this to be true, x would need to be entirely inside z without touching the boundary of z. Given that x touches the boundary of y, and y and z overlap, it's possible for x to be entirely inside z without touching the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z would need to be entirely contained within x, with z touching the boundary of x. However, since z overlaps with y, and y is only externally connected to x, it's not possible for z to be entirely contained within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same region. Given that y overlaps with z but is only externally connected to x, it's not possible for x and z to be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Wait, I think I'm still not thinking clearly about TPP and NTPP. Let me reason through it again.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. So, x is outside of y except for the boundary point(s) they share.

PO(y,z) means y and z overlap. This means y and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must touch the boundary of z. Given that x is outside of y except for the boundary point(s) they share, it's still possible for x to be inside z, touching the boundary of z. For instance, if z is a very large region that encompasses both x and a portion of y, then x could be a tangential proper part of z.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must not touch the boundary of z. Given that x is outside of y except for the boundary point(s) they share, it's still possible for x to be inside z, not touching the boundary of z. For instance, if z is a very large region that encompasses both x and a portion of y, with x being well inside z, then x could be a non-tangential proper part of z.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z would need to be entirely contained within x, with z touching the boundary of x. However, since z overlaps with y, and y is only externally connected to x, it's not possible for z to be entirely contained within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same region. Given that y overlaps with z but is only externally connected to x, it's not possible for x and z to be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

However, let me reconsider the converse relations, TPPi and NTPPi, one more time.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z would need to be entirely contained within x, with z touching the boundary of x. But since z overlaps with y, and y is only externally connected to x, it seems like z would extend outside of x, making TPPi(x,z) impossible.

But wait, what if z is a very small region that is entirely within the part of y that overlaps with x? No, that doesn't make sense because EC(x,y) means x and y don't share interior parts.

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible. Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me reconsider TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) again to make sure I'm thinking clearly.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must touch the boundary of z. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), z would need to contain x and also overlap with y. This is indeed possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must not touch the boundary of z. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), z would need to contain x entirely within its interior and also overlap with y. This is also possible.

I just want to double check: if EC(x,y), can x be part of y? No, EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. So, x is not a part of y.

If PO(y,z), can y be part of z? No, PO(y,z) means y and z share interior points, but neither is a part of the other.

Based on the above, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary point.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

Actually, I'm still a bit unsure about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let me think about these more carefully.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must touch the boundary of z. Given EC(x,y), x touches the boundary of y but doesn't share interior points with y. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points, but neither is a part of the other.

Now, for z to contain x, z would need to extend beyond the boundary of y at the point where x touches y. This is indeed possible. For instance, if z is a large region that overlaps with y and also encompasses x, with x touching the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) is valid.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and must not touch the boundary of z. Given the same constraints as above, this is also possible if z is a large region that encompasses x well within its interior.

But I'm just not sure. Let me try with a specific example to check if TPP(x,z) is possible.

Imagine x is a circle that touches another circle y at a single point. z is a larger circle that overlaps with y and also encompasses x, with x touching the boundary of z. In this scenario:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a single point.
- PO(y,z): y and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is entirely within z and touches the boundary of z.

This seems consistent, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, if x is a circle that touches another circle y at a single point, and z is a much larger circle that encompasses x well within its interior and also overlaps with y, then NTPP(x,z) is valid.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary point.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

And TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

I'm pretty sure this answer is correct now.

Actually, one last check. I think there might be a case where TPPi(x,z) is valid. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a tangential proper part of x. That is, z is contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given PO(y,z), y and z share interior points.

Now, for z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be entirely contained within x, touching the boundary of x. But since z shares interior points with y, and y is only externally connected to x, it's impossible for z to be entirely contained within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary point.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

And TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

I believe this answer is correct, but I'm going to double check it one more time.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a tangential proper part of x. That is, z is contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given PO(y,z), y and z share interior points.

If z is contained in x, then z can't share interior points with y because EC(x,y) means x and y don't share interior points. So, z being a tangential proper part of x contradicts PO(y,z). Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be the same region. But if x and z are the same, then the relationship between y and z would be the same as the relationship between y and x, which is EC. However, the given relation between y and z is PO, not EC. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary point.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

And TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

This is my final answer.

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let me understand what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share interior points, but neither is contained in the other)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x could be disconnected from z if x touches y at a point where z doesn't overlap with y.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x could touch z at their boundaries if z extends to the point where x and y touch.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z could partially overlap if z extends beyond y into the region of x.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be a tangential proper part of z if z is a large region that contains x and also overlaps with y, with x touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be entirely within the interior of z if z is large enough to contain x completely without x touching z's boundary.

The relations TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible because they would contradict the given relations.
