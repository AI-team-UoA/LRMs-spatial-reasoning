PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected (they share no spatial parts)
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (they are the same region)

Given these two relationships, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same region (coincident), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

So if DC(x,y) (x and y are disconnected), and y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), then x and z must also be disconnected.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- If x shares no points with y (DC(x,y))
- And y is exactly the same as z (EQ(y,z))
- Then x must share no points with z (DC(x,z))

Yes, this is correct. The answer is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no spatial parts)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (exactly the same region)

Since y and z are exactly the same region (EQ(y,z)), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

If x is disconnected from y, and y is identical to z, then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
