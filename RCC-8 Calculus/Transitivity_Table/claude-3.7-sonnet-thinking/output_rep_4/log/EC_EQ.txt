PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, which means they occupy exactly the same space.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), this means that y and z are exactly the same in terms of spatial occupation. They have the same boundaries and the same interior.

If EC(x,y) and y is exactly the same as z, then the relationship between x and z must also be EC (externally connected). This is because x touches y's boundary but doesn't share any interior with y, and since z is exactly the same as y, x also touches z's boundary but doesn't share any interior with z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

EC(x,y) means:
- x and y touch at a boundary.
- x and y do not share any interior parts.

EQ(y,z) means:
- y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).
- y's boundary is the same as z's boundary.
- y's interior is the same as z's interior.

Given these, if x touches y's boundary but doesn't share an interior with y, and y is exactly the same as z, then x must touch z's boundary but not share an interior with z. This is the definition of EC(x,z).

So, the answer is EC(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider this. We need to be precise about what EQ(y,z) means. If y and z are exactly the same region, then any relation between x and y must be the same as the relation between x and z.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, which means they are the same region.

Since y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Since EC(x,y), it must also be the case that EC(x,z).

So, the answer is EC(x,z).

Actually, let me ensure that my understanding of the relations is correct.

RCC-8 relations:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they do not share any points).
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at a boundary but do not share any interior points).
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other).
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is a subset of y and touches y's boundary).
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is a subset of y and does not touch y's boundary).
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is a subset of x and touches x's boundary).
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is a subset of x and does not touch x's boundary).
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal (they occupy the same space).

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are equal.

Since y and z are equal (they are the same region), any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Since EC(x,y), it must also be the case that EC(x,z).

So, the answer is EC(x,z).

Let me double-check this to be absolutely sure: 

When we say EQ(y,z), we're saying that y and z are the same spatial region. If x touches y at a boundary (EC(x,y)), and y is the same as z, then x must also touch z at a boundary in exactly the same way. The relation between x and z is therefore EC(x,z).

I believe the answer is indeed EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relationships EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) constrain the possible relationship between x and z.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical in spatial terms (same boundaries, same interior), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must necessarily hold between x and z as well.

Since EC(x,y) holds, and z is spatially identical to y, then x must have the exact same relationship with z as it does with y.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
