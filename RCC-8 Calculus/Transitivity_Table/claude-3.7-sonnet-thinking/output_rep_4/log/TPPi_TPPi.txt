PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step. 

We know that:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given these two facts, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since TPPi(x,y) means y is part of x, and TPPi(y,z) means z is part of y, by transitivity of the part-of relation, we know that z is part of x. So z is definitely part of x.

Now, the question is: does z touch x's boundary?

Since z touches y's boundary (from TPPi(y,z)), and y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), it's possible that z touches x's boundary as well. But it's also possible that z only touches parts of y's boundary that are in the interior of x, not touching x's boundary.

So there are two possibilities:
1. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z touches x's boundary.
2. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z does not touch x's boundary.

Let's double-check this by considering some concrete examples:

Example 1: Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary, and z is an even smaller circle inside y and touching y's boundary where y touches x's boundary. In this case, z also touches x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z) holds.

Example 2: Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary, and z is an even smaller circle inside y but touching a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x. In this case, z does not touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But wait, let me reconsider again more carefully. Actually, I'm not sure if my examples are correct, since I'm focusing on the case where regions are circles, which is a specific case. Let me think more generally.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
When I say "y touches x's boundary", it means there is a point that is both in y and on the boundary of x.

TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is part of y and touches y's boundary.
When I say "z touches y's boundary", it means there is a point that is both in z and on the boundary of y.

So, if TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then z is definitely part of x (by transitivity). 

But can z be a tangential proper part of x? That would mean z touches x's boundary. Let's think about this:

If z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, does that mean z touches x's boundary? Not necessarily. 

Let's imagine y's boundary consists of two parts: one part that is on x's boundary, and another part that is in the interior of x. If z only touches the part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x, then z does not touch x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z) doesn't hold. Instead, NTPPi(x,z) holds, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

But if z touches the part of y's boundary that is on x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me try to visualize this: Picture a big circle (x), with a smaller circle (y) inside it and touching its boundary. Now consider a tiny circle (z) inside y.

Case 1: If z touches y's boundary at the point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z) holds.

Case 2: If z touches y's boundary at a point that is in the interior of x, then z does not touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So the answer is:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me just quickly check to make sure I have the relationships right in my head. From the problem statement:

TPPi(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. Actually no, it means "TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)". And TPP(y,x) means that y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

So TPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x and touches x's boundary. 

TPPi(y,z) means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, since z is part of y and y is part of x, we know that z is part of x (by transitivity). 

But does z touch x's boundary? Not necessarily. As I reasoned above, z might touch a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x, in which case z doesn't touch x's boundary. On the other hand, z might touch a part of y's boundary that is on x's boundary, in which case z does touch x's boundary.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z), which means z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z), which means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself with the notation. Let me try to work with the original definitions:

DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).
EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

So:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given that y is part of x and z is part of y, we know that z is part of x.

If z touches x's boundary, then TPP(z,x) holds, which is the same as TPPi(x,z).

If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPP(z,x) holds, which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me verify this with some concrete examples:

Example 1: x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary, and z is an even smaller circle inside y and touching y's boundary at the point where y touches x's boundary. In this case, z also touches x's boundary, so TPP(z,x) holds, which is the same as TPPi(x,z).

Example 2: x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary, and z is an even smaller circle inside y but touching a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x. In this case, z does not touch x's boundary, so NTPP(z,x) holds, which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait. I'm forgetting a possibility. If z is exactly the same as x, then EQ(x,z) would hold. But that can't be the case here, because z is part of y and y is part of x, and we know that y is a proper part of x (because TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x). So z is a proper part of x, and EQ(x,z) can't hold.

So the answer is:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But wait, let me just double-check that I didn't miss any other possibilities.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given these, z is part of x. So the relation between x and z must be one of:
- TPP(z,x), which is the same as TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

But as I've shown, EQ(x,z) can't hold because z is a proper part of x. So the possible relationships are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check if I'm missing anything else. Could it be that x and z are disconnected (DC), externally connected (EC), or partially overlapping (PO)? No, because z is part of x, so they are not disconnected, not externally connected, and not partially overlapping.

Could it be that x is part of z? No, because z is part of y and y is part of x, so by transitivity, z is part of x. It can't be the other way around.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I need to be careful and fully reason through each relation to make sure I haven't missed anything. Let's go through each of the 8 relations and see if it could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we know z is part of x, so they are not disconnected. So DC(x,z) can't hold.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. But we know z is part of x, so they do share interior parts. So EC(x,z) can't hold.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. But we know z is part of x, so PO(x,z) can't hold.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. But we know z is part of x, so it can't be the other way around. So TPP(x,z) can't hold.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. But we know z is part of x, so it can't be the other way around. So NTPP(x,z) can't hold.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This could hold, as I've explained earlier. If z touches the part of y's boundary that is on x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z) holds.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This could also hold, as I've explained earlier. If z only touches the part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x, then z doesn't touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. But we know z is a proper part of x, so they are not coincident. So EQ(x,z) can't hold.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

So, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are the possible relationships between x and z.

Let me add one final check just to be sure. In the problem statement, we're told:

TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
And TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given these, we know:
- y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

By transitivity, z is part of x. Now, we need to determine if z touches x's boundary.

If z touches x's boundary, then the relation is TPPi(x,z). If z doesn't touch x's boundary, then the relation is NTPPi(x,z). Both of these scenarios are possible, as I've explained earlier.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

OK, so the answer is:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship exists between x and z given the two facts:
1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary)
2. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and touches y's boundary)

By transitivity of the part-of relation:
- Since y is part of x, and z is part of y, then z must be part of x

Now I need to determine whether z touches x's boundary:

Case 1: If z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary, making z a tangential proper part of x. This gives us TPPi(x,z).

Case 2: If z only touches y's boundary at points that are in the interior of x (not touching x's boundary), then z would be completely in the interior of x, making z a non-tangential proper part of x. This gives us NTPPi(x,z).

Both cases are possible given the constraints, and no other RCC-8 relation is possible.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
