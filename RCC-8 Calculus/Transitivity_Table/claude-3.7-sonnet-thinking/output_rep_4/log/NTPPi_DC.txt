PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the information we have.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.

DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. They don't share any spatial parts and don't touch.

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about it geometrically. We know that y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is completely separated from y. Given these constraints, z could be in various positions relative to x:

1. z could be completely outside x, not touching x's boundary. This would be DC(x,z).
2. z could be touching x's boundary from the outside. This would be EC(x,z).
3. z could be partially overlapping with x. This would be PO(x,z).
4. z could be completely inside x, touching x's boundary. This would be TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).
5. z could be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This would be NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Let's check if any of these possibilities are ruled out by the given constraints.

We know that y is inside x (not touching x's boundary) and z is completely separated from y. 

Case 1: DC(x,z) - z is completely outside x. This is consistent with the given constraints.

Case 2: EC(x,z) - z touches x's boundary from the outside. This is also consistent, as z can be outside x but touching its boundary, while still being disconnected from y which is inside x.

Case 3: PO(x,z) - z partially overlaps with x. This is also consistent, as the part of z that overlaps with x can still be disconnected from y.

Case 4: TPPi(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning z contains x and touches x's boundary. But if z contains x, and y is inside x, then z would also contain y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So this case is ruled out.

Case 5: NTPPi(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning z contains x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, if z contains x, and y is inside x, then z would also contain y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So this case is also ruled out.

Actually, let me be more careful. 

For Case 4 (TPPi(x,z)), if x is a tangential proper part of z, it means x is completely contained in z but touches z's boundary. Since y is completely contained in x (NTPPi(x,y)), y is also completely contained in z. But this contradicts DC(y,z), which states that y and z are disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

For Case 5 (NTPPi(x,z)), if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, it means x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, since y is completely contained in x, y is also completely contained in z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is also not a possible relationship.

Let's also check if EQ(x,z) is possible. EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y would also be inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

What about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z)?

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. But if x is contained in z, and y is contained in x, then y is contained in z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, if x is contained in z, and y is contained in x, then y is contained in z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.

Actually, wait. Let me just double-check each case.

First, let's verify the meaning of NTPPi(x,y). It means y is a non-tangential proper part of x, or equivalently, x contains y, and y does not touch the boundary of x.

DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected, they don't share any points.

For DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then since y is contained in x, y and z are also disconnected. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

For EC(x,z): If x and z touch at their boundaries, then since y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, y and z are disconnected. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

For PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then y, being entirely inside x, could either be in the part of x that overlaps with z, or in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. But if y is in the part of x that overlaps with z, then y and z would not be disconnected, which contradicts DC(y,z). So for PO(x,z) to be consistent with DC(y,z), y must be in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. This is possible.

For TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely inside z, which means y is also entirely inside z (since y is inside x). This contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then again, x is entirely inside z, which means y is also entirely inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely inside x. But then, since y is also entirely inside x, y and z could potentially overlap, which would contradict DC(y,z). But if y and z are in different parts of x, then they could still be disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, since y is also entirely inside x, y and z could potentially overlap, which would contradict DC(y,z). But if y and z are in different parts of x, then they could still be disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, then since y is entirely inside x, y is also entirely inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I need to be more careful here.

Let's be very clear about the definitions:

1. DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, i.e., they don't share any points.
2. EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected, i.e., they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
3. PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap, i.e., they share some points but neither is completely contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is completely contained in y and touches the boundary of y.
5. NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is completely contained in y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
6. TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP, i.e., TPPi(x,y) is equivalent to TPP(y,x). It means y is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP, i.e., NTPPi(x,y) is equivalent to NTPP(y,x). It means y is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region.

Given NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Given DC(y,z), we know that y and z don't share any points.

Now, let's systematically consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is consistent with the given constraints because if x and z don't share any points, then y (being inside x) and z also don't share any points, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is also consistent because if x and z only touch at their boundaries, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x (from NTPPi(x,y)), then y and z don't share any points, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This could be consistent if y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. But if y is in the part of x that overlaps with z, then y and z would share points, which contradicts DC(y,z). So PO(x,z) is possible but with a constraint on where y is located within x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. If x is completely contained in z, then y (being inside x) is also completely contained in z. This means y and z would share points, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Again, if x is completely contained in z, then y is also completely contained in z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. This could be consistent if y and z don't overlap within x. If y and z are in different parts of x, then they could be disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, this could be consistent if y and z don't overlap within x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then y (being inside x) is also inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me check more carefully. 

For PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z), I said they're possible if y and z don't overlap within x. Let me check this more carefully.

For PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. If y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z, then y and z don't share any points, which is consistent with DC(y,z). But is it guaranteed that such a part exists? Yes, because PO(x,z) means neither x nor z is completely contained in the other, so there's a part of x that doesn't overlap with z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. We need to check if it's possible for y and z to not overlap within x. Given NTPPi(x,y), y is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Given TPPi(x,z), z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Since y doesn't touch the boundary of x but z does, there's a part of z that's not in y. But could there be a part of z that is in y? If there is, then y and z would overlap, which contradicts DC(y,z). So for TPPi(x,z) to be consistent with the given constraints, y and z must be disjoint within x. Is this possible? Yes, because x can be large enough to contain both y and z separately. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, we need to check if it's possible for y and z to not overlap within x. The reasoning is similar to the TPPi case. For NTPPi(x,z) to be consistent with the given constraints, y and z must be disjoint within x, which is possible if x is large enough. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually, let me reason carefully for the TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) cases.

For TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. "Proper part" means z is entirely contained in x. Crucially, since we know that y is an NTPP of x and is DC from z, this forces y and z to be in separate parts of x. Since both y and z are inside x, it's entirely possible for both to be true. Consider a picture of a circle x, with a smaller circle y inside it, not touching x's boundary, and another smaller circle z also inside x, touching x's boundary, but separated from y. This scenario satisfies all our constraints. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is entirely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, given that y is also an NTPP of x and is DC from z, y and z must be in separate parts of x, which is possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let's verify these one more time:

Given NTPPi(x,y), y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is entirely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. They don't share any points.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is consistent because if x and z don't share any points, then y (being inside x) and z also don't share any points, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is also consistent because if x and z only touch at their boundaries, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x (from NTPPi(x,y)), then y and z don't share any points, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This could be consistent if y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. There's a part of x that doesn't overlap with z because PO(x,z) means neither x nor z is completely contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. If x is entirely contained in z, then y (being inside x) is also entirely contained in z. This means y and z would share points, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Again, if x is entirely contained in z, then y is also entirely contained in z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. This could be consistent if y and z don't overlap within x. Given that y doesn't touch the boundary of x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and z does touch the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,z)), y and z can be disjoint within x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is entirely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, this could be consistent if y and z don't overlap within x, which is possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then y (being inside x) is also inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, actually, actually, I realize that I've been overlooking something important. Let me reason once more, and I'll try to visualize the spatial constraints more directly.

Given NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Another way to state this is that y is in the interior of x.

Given DC(y,z), we know that y and z are disconnected. They don't share any points.

Let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. If x and z don't share any points, then y (being inside x) and z also don't share any points. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. If x and z only touch at their boundaries, and y is in the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)), then y and z don't share any points. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means there's a part of x that's also part of z, and there's a part of x that's not part of z, and there's a part of z that's not part of x. If y is in the part of x that's also part of z, then y would also be part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z). But if y is in the part of x that's not part of z, then y and z don't share any points, which is consistent with DC(y,z). So PO(x,z) is possible, but only if y is in the part of x that's not part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. If x is completely contained in z, then y (being inside x) is also completely contained in z. This means y and z would share points, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Again, if x is completely contained in z, then y (being inside x) is also completely contained in z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Since y is in the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and z touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,z)), y and z could be disjoint within x. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, y and z could be disjoint within x, which is consistent with DC(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then y (being inside x) is also inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap, with y in the part of x that's not part of z.
4. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Hold on, I'm still not being careful about the spatial constraints. Let me visualize this.

Given NTPPi(x,y), y is in the interior of x. For DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

For DC(x,z), x and z are disconnected. This is consistent with DC(y,z), since if x and z are disconnected, then y (being inside x) and z are also disconnected.

For EC(x,z), x and z touch at their boundaries. This is also consistent with DC(y,z), since y is in the interior of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, so y and z don't share any points.

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap. This is tricky. If the part of x that overlaps with z contains y, then y would also overlap with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). But if y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z, then y and z are disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z). So PO(x,z) is possible, but only if y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z.

For TPP(x,z), x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. This means y (being inside x) is also contained in z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Again, this means y is contained in z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Since y is in the interior of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, while z touches the boundary of x, y and z could be disjoint within x. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means both y and z are in the interior of x. If they don't overlap within the interior of x, then they are disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z are the same region. This means y (being inside x) is also inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap, with y in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z.
4. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x, and y and z are disjoint within x.
5. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y and z are disjoint within x.

But wait, I need to be more careful about condition #3. Is it always possible for y to be in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z in a PO(x,z) relationship? Let's see.

In a PO(x,z) relationship, there's a part of x that overlaps with z, a part of x that doesn't overlap with z, and a part of z that doesn't overlap with x. Given NTPPi(x,y), y is in the interior of x. But is it guaranteed that y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z? No, it's not guaranteed. If y is in the part of x that overlaps with z, then y would also overlap with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). But if y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z, then y and z are disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z). So PO(x,z) is possible, but only if y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z.

Similarly, for conditions #4 and #5, I need to check if it's always possible for y and z to be disjoint within x.

In a TPPi(x,z) relationship, z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Given NTPPi(x,y), y is in the interior of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Since z touches the boundary of x, there's a part of z that's not in the interior of x. But there could also be a part of z that's in the interior of x. If this part overlaps with y, then y and z would not be disconnected, which contradicts DC(y,z). So for TPPi(x,z) to be consistent with the given constraints, y and z must be disjoint within the interior of x. Is this always possible? It's not guaranteed, but it's certainly possible. If x is large enough, it can contain both y and z separately.

In a NTPPi(x,z) relationship, z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means z is also in the interior of x, just like y. If y and z overlap within the interior of x, then they would not be disconnected, which contradicts DC(y,z). So for NTPPi(x,z) to be consistent with the given constraints, y and z must be disjoint within the interior of x. Again, this is not guaranteed, but it's possible if x is large enough.

So, to be precise, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap, and y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z.
4. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x, and y and z are disjoint within the interior of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y and z are disjoint within the interior of x.

But upon further reflection, I realize that these constraints on the possible relationships might not be what the question is asking for. The question is simply asking for the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given the constraints NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z).

So, the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I realize I'm still being imprecise. The question is asking for the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given the constraints NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z). I need to check if each of the 8 RCC relationships between x and z is consistent with the given constraints, without adding further constraints.

Let me start once more.

Given NTPPi(x,y), y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. They don't share any points.

For each of the 8 RCC relationships between x and z, I need to check if it's consistent with the given constraints:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. If x and z don't share any points, then y (being inside x) and z also don't share any points. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. If x and z only touch at their boundaries, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x (from NTPPi(x,y)), then y and z don't share any points. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means there's a part of x that's also part of z, and there's a part of x that's not part of z, and there's a part of z that's not part of x. If y is in the part of x that's not part of z, then y and z don't share any points, which is consistent with DC(y,z). But if y is in the part of x that's also part of z, then y would also be part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So PO(x,z) is possible, but only if y is in the part of x that's not part of z. But this is an additional constraint, and I'm just checking if PO(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints without adding further constraints. So, is PO(x,z) possible given NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z)? Yes, it's possible, because there's a scenario where y is in the part of x that's not part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. If x is completely contained in z, then y (being inside x) is also completely contained in z. This means y is part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Again, if x is completely contained in z, then y is also completely contained in z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Since y is in the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and z touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,z)), y and z could be disjoint within x, which is consistent with DC(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Again, y and z could be disjoint within the interior of x, which is consistent with DC(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then y (being inside x) is also inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (no shared points)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then y (which is inside x) would also be disconnected from z. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): If x and z touch only at their boundaries, then y (which doesn't touch x's boundary) would be disconnected from z. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, this is possible as long as y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z. This scenario maintains DC(y,z).

4. TPP(x,z): If x is inside z touching z's boundary, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z not touching z's boundary, then y would also be inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is inside x touching x's boundary, this is possible as long as y and z don't overlap within x. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, y and z can be disconnected within x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is completely inside x not touching x's boundary, this is possible as long as y and z don't overlap within x.

8. EQ(x,z): If x equals z, then y would be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
