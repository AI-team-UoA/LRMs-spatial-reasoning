PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me figure out what are the possible relations between x and z, if we know that DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let me recall the meaning of these relationships:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I'll need to think about the spatial configurations that satisfy both DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Given that DC(x,y), x and y are completely disconnected. They don't share any parts and don't even touch at their boundaries.

Given that EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. x could be far away from both y and z, such that x is disconnected from z as well.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. x could be touching z at its boundary while still being disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z could overlap (share some interior parts) while x is still disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z but touches z's boundary, and y is outside z and touches z at a different part of its boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and y is outside z but touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. This is possible if z is inside x but touches x's boundary, and y is outside x but touches z at the point where z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y is outside x but touches z's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident (the same region). This doesn't seem possible because if x and z are the same, and y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then y must also touch x at its boundary, which contradicts DC(x,y).

Let me check that last case again. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. If EC(y,z), then y touches z at its boundary. But that would mean y also touches x at its boundary, which would make it EC(x,y), contradicting our given DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me also double-check TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) because I'm not entirely sure about those.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is outside x but touches z at the point where z touches x's boundary, then y would also be touching x at its boundary. But this contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary. If z is completely inside x and y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then y must be inside x as well. But this would mean y and x are not disconnected, contradicting DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible either.

Actually, let me take a different approach for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). 

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at its boundary. If y touches z at a point where z also touches x (since z is tangential to x), then y would also be touching x, contradicting DC(x,y). If y touches z at a point where z doesn't touch x, then y must be inside x, which again contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at its boundary. But if z is completely inside x, then y must also be inside x to touch z. This contradicts DC(x,y), which says x and y are disconnected. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let me re-evaluate TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) to make sure my reasoning is correct.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at its boundary. It's possible for x to be inside z, touching z's boundary at one point, while y touches z at a different point on z's boundary. This would maintain both DC(x,y) and EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary. Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at its boundary. It's possible for x to be completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), while y touches z at its boundary. This would maintain both DC(x,y) and EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)

Let me just double-check that I've been thorough in my reasoning:

DC(x,z): Possible. x and z can be completely disconnected.
EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries.
PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can overlap.
TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z.
NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z.
TPPi(x,z): Not possible, as I explained above.
NTPPi(x,z): Not possible, as I explained above.
EQ(x,z): Not possible, as I explained above.

Actually, let me revisit TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) to be even more careful. I want to make sure I've considered all possibilities.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at its boundary. 

If y touches z at a point where z also touches x (since z is tangential to x), then y would also be touching x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

If y touches z at a point where z doesn't touch x, then y would be inside x. This contradicts DC(x,y) because if y is inside x, they are not disconnected.

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at its boundary. 

If z is completely inside x, and y touches z at its boundary, then y must also be inside x. This contradicts DC(x,y) because if y is inside x, they are not disconnected.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

I think my analysis is correct. The possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me check PO(x,z) again to be sure. 

PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts, but neither is a part of the other. Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at its boundary. 

If x and z partially overlap, then y can touch z at a part of z's boundary that is outside of x. This would maintain both DC(x,y) and EC(y,z). So, PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me do a final check on my reasoning and then provide the answer.

To summarize the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z):
1. DC(x,z): Possible. x and z can be completely disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would either be touching x or be inside x, both of which contradict DC(x,y).
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are the same, and y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then y would also be touching x at its boundary, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So, the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me check once more. Could TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) be possible if y touches z at a part of z's boundary that's also part of x's boundary?

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), y touches z at its boundary. 

If y touches z at a point where z also touches x (since z is tangential to x), then y would also be touching x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

Actually, I think I've been assuming the wrong thing. TPP and its inverse TPPi, as well as NTPP and its inverse NTPPi, are not symmetric. TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPP(z,x). Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x).

Given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), let's reconsider TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then y either touches x at its boundary (if y touches z at a point where z also touches x) or y is inside x (if y touches z at a point where z doesn't touch x). In the first case, we have EC(x,y), and in the second case, we have some kind of part relation between y and x (either TPP or NTPP). Both of these contradict DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. If y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then y must also be inside x. This gives us some kind of part relation between y and x (either TPP or NTPP), which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me be even more sure and try to visualize these scenarios:

1. DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z. For example, x, y, and z could be three separate circles, with y touching z but not touching x.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z at its boundary. For example, x and z could be two circles that touch at one point, and y could be a third circle that touches z at a different point, but doesn't touch x.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. For example, x and z could be two overlapping circles, and y could be a third circle that touches z at a point outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. For example, x could be a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point, and y could be a circle outside of z, touching z at a different point on its boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For example, x could be a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and y could be a circle outside of z, touching z at its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x, touching x's boundary. If y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then y must either be touching x at its boundary (if y touches z at a point where z also touches x) or be inside x (if y touches z at a point where z doesn't touch x). In either case, y is not disconnected from x, contradicting DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. If y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then y must also be inside x. This means y is not disconnected from x, contradicting DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. If y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then y also touches x at its boundary, contradicting DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on my visualizations, I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)

Let me quickly re-analyze these one more time. Specifically, let me think about if there are any other constraints.

DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected. That means that there are no points shared between x and y.
EC(y, z): y and z touch at a boundary, but share no interior parts. 

The constraints this produces:
- x has no points in common with y.
- y has boundary points in common with z, but no interior points.

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. If y and z touch at a boundary, but x is completely separated from both y and z, then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x, z): x and z touch at a boundary. This is possible. If x and z touch at a boundary, and y also touches z at a different part of the boundary, while x and y remain disconnected, then all conditions are satisfied.

3. PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. If x and z partially overlap, and y touches z at a part of its boundary that doesn't overlap with x, then all conditions are satisfied.

4. TPP(x, z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches z at a different part of its boundary, then all conditions are satisfied.

5. NTPP(x, z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. If x is completely inside z, and y touches z at its boundary, then all conditions are satisfied.

6. TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z at its boundary, then y either touches x (if y touches z at a point where z also touches x) or y is inside x (if y touches z at a point where z doesn't touch x). In either case, y is not disconnected from x, contradicting DC(x, y). So, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is completely inside x, and y touches z at its boundary, then y must also be inside x. This means y is not disconnected from x, contradicting DC(x, y). So, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): x and z are the same. If y touches z at its boundary, then y also touches x at its boundary, contradicting DC(x, y). So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x, y) and EC(y, z), are:
1. DC(x, z)
2. EC(x, z)
3. PO(x, z)
4. TPP(x, z)
5. NTPP(x, z)

This is consistent with my previous analysis. I believe this is the correct answer.

Let me double-check my logic for the impossible cases:

6. TPPi(x, z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y, z), y touches z at its boundary. If y touches z at a point where z also touches x, then y would also touch x, making it EC(x, y), which contradicts DC(x, y). If y touches z at a point where z doesn't touch x, then y would be inside x, again contradicting DC(x, y). So, TPPi(x, z) is indeed not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is completely inside x. Given EC(y, z), y touches z at its boundary. But if z is completely inside x, then y must also be inside x to touch z, contradicting DC(x, y). So, NTPPi(x, z) is indeed not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): This means x and z are the same. Given EC(y, z), y touches z at its boundary. But if x and z are the same, then y would also touch x at its boundary, making it EC(x, y), which contradicts DC(x, y). So, EQ(x, z) is indeed not possible.

So, my answer remains the same. The possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x, y) and EC(y, z), are:
1. DC(x, z)
2. EC(x, z)
3. PO(x, z)
4. TPP(x, z)
5. NTPP(x, z)

Hmm, I feel that I might still be missing something. Let me try to think about it from a different angle.

First, we know that DC(x, y), so x and y are disconnected. This means x and y don't share any points.
Second, we know that EC(y, z), so y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now, let's think about the constraints this imposes on the relationship between x and z:

If x and z have interior points in common, then x and y must be disconnected (since x and y don't share any points). This allows for the following relationships: PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), NTPP(x, z).

If x and z don't have interior points in common, then they are either disconnected or touch at their boundaries. This allows for the following relationships: DC(x, z), EC(x, z).

For the inverse relationships (where z is part of x), we need to consider if it's possible for y to touch z while being disconnected from x:

For TPPi(x, z), z is a tangential proper part of x. If y touches z, it either touches x as well (if z touches x at the same point) or it's inside x (if z touches x at a different point). In either case, y is not disconnected from x, contradicting DC(x, y). So, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x, z), z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If y touches z, it must be inside x, contradicting DC(x, y). So, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

For EQ(x, z), x and z are the same. If y touches z, it also touches x, contradicting DC(x, y). So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given DC(x, y) and EC(y, z), are:
1. DC(x, z)
2. EC(x, z)
3. PO(x, z)
4. TPP(x, z)
5. NTPP(x, z)

I'm now confident that this is the correct answer.

To recap:
Given DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected.
Given EC(y, z): y and z touch at their boundaries.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x, z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x, z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x, z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

The relationships TPPi(x, z), NTPPi(x, z), and EQ(x, z) are not possible because they would contradict the given constraint DC(x, y).

ANSWER:

I'll analyze the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, sharing no points
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries only

Possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x can be completely disconnected from z (e.g., x is separated from both y and z)

2. EC(x,z): x can touch z at their boundaries (e.g., x touches z at a different boundary point than where y touches z)

3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap (e.g., x overlaps with z in a region that doesn't include y)

4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z (x inside z touching z's boundary, with y touching z elsewhere)

5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z (x completely inside z, with y touching z's boundary)

Not possible:
- TPPi(x,z): If z were inside x touching x's boundary, y would either touch x or be inside x, contradicting DC(x,y)
- NTPPi(x,z): If z were completely inside x, y would have to be inside x to touch z, contradicting DC(x,y)
- EQ(x,z): If x and z were identical, y would touch x, contradicting DC(x,y)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
