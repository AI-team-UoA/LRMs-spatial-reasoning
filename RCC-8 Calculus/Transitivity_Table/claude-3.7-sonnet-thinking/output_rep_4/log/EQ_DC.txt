PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason about this step by step.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (i.e., they are the same spatial region).
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (they share no spatial parts).

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same spatial region. This means that any relation that holds between y and z will also hold between x and z.

Given that DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. Since x is the same as y (due to EQ(x,y)), x and z must also be disconnected.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

- EQ(x,y) means x and y occupy the same spatial region.
- DC(y,z) means y and z share no spatial parts.
- Since x and y are the same region, and y shares no parts with z, it follows that x shares no parts with z.
- Therefore, DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

I've verified that DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship given the constraints.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relationships EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) constrain the possible relationship between x and z.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are the same spatial region)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (they share no spatial parts)

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are exactly the same spatial region, x must have exactly the same relationship with z as y does with z. 

Since y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), and x is the same region as y, x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
