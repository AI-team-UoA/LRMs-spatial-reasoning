PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the given relations.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained entirely within x and does not touch the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained entirely within y and does not touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- y is contained entirely within x and does not touch the boundary of x.
- z is contained entirely within y and does not touch the boundary of y.

Since z is entirely contained within y, and y is entirely contained within x, it follows that z is entirely contained within x. 

Moreover, since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double check this by thinking about concrete examples. Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside x (not touching the boundary), and z is an even smaller circle completely inside y (not touching the boundary of y). Then indeed, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, so we have NTPPi(x,z).

In fact, let's go through all eight RCC-8 relations and check if they are possible for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we know z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z is inside x. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But since z is inside y, and y is inside x without touching the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. But we know z is completely inside y, which is completely inside x, so z is completely inside x. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. But since y is inside x and z is inside y, this would mean z is inside x, not the other way around. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. But since y is inside x and z is inside y, this would mean z is inside x, not the other way around. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But since z is inside y and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Given that z is inside y, and y is inside x without touching the boundary of x, z is indeed inside x without touching the boundary of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal or coincident. But if x and z were equal, then y would be inside z, which contradicts the fact that z is inside y. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after checking all eight RCC-8 relations, I've confirmed that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me more carefully rethink things. We want to figure out what the relationship is between x and z. We know that z is inside y, and y is inside x. 

Let's go through the 8 relations more carefully.

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are completely disconnected. But we know z is inside y, and y is inside x, so z is inside x. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries. But z is inside y, and y is inside x without touching the boundary of x, so z is inside x without touching the boundary of x. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, with some parts of z outside of x. But z is inside y, and y is inside x, so all of z is inside x. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(z,x): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But z is inside y, and y is inside x without touching the boundary of x, so z is inside x without touching the boundary of x. Therefore, TPP(z,x) is not possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Given that z is inside y, and y is inside x without touching the boundary of x, z is indeed inside x without touching the boundary of x. Therefore, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPPi(z,x): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. But y is inside x, and z is inside y, so x cannot be inside z. Therefore, TPPi(z,x) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(z,x): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. But y is inside x, and z is inside y, so x cannot be inside z. Therefore, NTPPi(z,x) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal or coincident. But z is inside y, and y is inside x, so x and z cannot be equal. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after carefully checking all eight RCC-8 relations, I've confirmed that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x).

Now, I realize that NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), so both of those expressions mean the same thing. So I'll confirm once more that the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I think I might have been making a mistake in my earlier analysis. Let me be even more precise. We're given:

- NTPPi(x,y): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that y is contained within x and z is contained within y, it follows that z is contained within x. But I need to be careful about whether z can touch the boundary of x.

Since y is a non-tangential proper part of x, y doesn't touch the boundary of x. Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, z doesn't touch the boundary of y. Given these constraints, z can't touch the boundary of x.

So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

However, I want to be absolutely sure about this, so let me consider concrete regions and visualize the scenario once more.

Let x be a large circle, y be a smaller circle inside x (without touching the boundary of x), and z be an even smaller circle inside y (without touching the boundary of y).

Given that z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, it's clear that z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This confirms that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

But now I'm thinking, if all we know is that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), that doesn't give us the exact position of z inside y and y inside x. So there could be other possibilities for the relationship between x and z.

Let me redo the analysis more carefully. We know:

- NTPPi(x,y): y is properly contained in x, not touching the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is properly contained in y, not touching the boundary of y.

Hmm, given that z is properly contained within y and y is properly contained within x, z is definitely contained within x.

Can z touch the boundary of x? No, because it's contained within y and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, z is properly contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, I'm fairly confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, thinking about this more, let me check if there's any possibility that z could be equal to x (EQ(x,z)). If z is equal to x, then z would include y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z) because it would mean y contains z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

What about the other relations?

- DC(x,z): Not possible because z is inside y and y is inside x, so z is inside x.
- EC(x,z): Not possible because z is inside y and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, so z can't touch the boundary of x.
- PO(x,z): Not possible because z is entirely inside x, so they don't partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): Not possible because z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- TPPi(z,x): Not possible because y is inside x, and z is inside y, so x can't be inside z.
- NTPP(z,x): Possible, as discussed.
- NTPPi(z,x): Not possible because y is inside x, and z is inside y, so x can't be inside z.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because z is inside y and y is inside x, so z can't be equal to x.

Thus, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Ok, I've been getting confused on the notation, so let me be explicit in how I interpret the relations.

NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b. In other words, a is entirely contained in b and doesn't touch the boundary of b.
NTPPi(a,b) means NTPP(b,a), that is, b is entirely contained in a and doesn't touch the boundary of a.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is entirely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is entirely contained in y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since z is entirely inside y, and y is entirely inside x, z is entirely inside x. Moreover, since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x.

So, z is entirely contained in x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, in the definition of the problem itself, I can check what the notation means.

Let me check the definition again:

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).

Given these definitions, NTPPi(x,y) means y is a part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, since z is a part of y and y is a part of x, it follows that z is a part of x.

Does z touch the boundary of x? Since z is a part of y and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x.

So, z is a part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I think I've now carefully checked and confirmed that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me be even more careful. We're given:

- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), which means y is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), which means z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given that z is inside y and y is inside x, we can definitively say that z is inside x.

Now, can z touch the boundary of x? Since z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x.

So, z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think my logic here is correct and now I'm confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

We want to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x.

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm going to more very carefully one more time through all 8 relations to check if any of them could be the relationship between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Given that z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x, so they are connected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Given that z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x, so they don't just touch at the boundaries. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, with some parts of x outside of z and some parts of z outside of x. Given that z is inside y and y is inside x, all of z is inside x, so they don't partially overlap. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. Given that y is inside x and z is inside y, z is inside x, not the other way around. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Given that y is inside x and z is inside y, z is inside x, not the other way around. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. Given that z is inside y and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Given that z is inside y and y is inside x without touching the boundary of x, z is inside x without touching the boundary of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal or coincident. Given that y is inside x and z is inside y, x and z cannot be equal. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

After checking all eight RCC-8 relations, I've confirmed that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Actually, wait, let me be even more careful about my definitions here:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), so y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), so z is part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z is part of x.

Can z touch the boundary of x? Since z is part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, z can't touch the boundary of x.

So, z is part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, I'm very confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, I need to be careful here, and think again about the definition of the transitive relation.

We're given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x). So, y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y). So, z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We want to infer what relation(s) hold between x and z.

Let's double check this. We have:
- NTPP(y,x): y is inside x without touching x's boundary.
- NTPP(z,y): z is inside y without touching y's boundary.

So, z is inside y, which is inside x. This means z is inside x.

Can z touch the boundary of x? Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x.

So, z is inside x without touching the boundary of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

This is the same as one of the relations I've been getting all along, but I was confusing myself with the notation. I think I'm sure now that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z) or, equivalently, NTPP(z,x).

Let's summarize:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x without touching x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is inside y without touching y's boundary.

We infer:
- z is inside x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Now, I should double check this using specific shapes. Let's say:
- x is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside x, not touching the boundary of x.
- z is an even smaller circle inside y, not touching the boundary of y.

In this visualization, z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

One more check. I'll go through all 8 relations, using the correct definitions:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts. Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x, so they are connected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x, so they don't just touch at the boundaries. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x, so z is part of x. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Since y is inside x and z is inside y, z is inside x, not the other way around. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. Since y is inside x and z is inside y, z is inside x, not the other way around. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Since z is inside y and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. Since z is inside y and y is inside x without touching the boundary of x, z is inside x without touching the boundary of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. Since y is inside x and z is inside y, x and z cannot be coincident. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after checking all eight RCC-8 relations, I've confirmed that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is part of x but doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, our answer is:

The possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationship holds between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me interpret what these given relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y): z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

From these facts, I can determine:
- Since z is completely inside y (without touching y's boundary)
- And y is completely inside x (without touching x's boundary)
- Therefore, z must be completely inside x
- Furthermore, z cannot touch x's boundary because z doesn't even touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary

Going through each of the RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,z): Not possible as z is inside x
- EC(x,z): Not possible as z cannot touch x's boundary
- PO(x,z): Not possible as z is completely inside x
- TPP(x,z): Not possible as z is inside x, not vice versa
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible as z is inside x, not vice versa
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible as z cannot touch x's boundary
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible as z is inside x without touching its boundary
- EQ(x,z): Not possible as z is inside y which is inside x

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
