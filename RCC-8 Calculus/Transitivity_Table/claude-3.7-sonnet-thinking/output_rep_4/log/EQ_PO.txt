PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. 

We know:
1. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region.
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial part, but neither is a part of the other.

Given that x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), x and y are essentially interchangeable from a spatial perspective. So if PO(y,z) holds, then PO(x,z) must also hold. 

In other words, if y partially overlaps with z, and x is exactly the same spatial region as y, then x must also partially overlap with z.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. The eight RCC-8 relations are:
- DC (disconnected)
- EC (externally connected)
- PO (partially overlapping)
- TPP (tangential proper part)
- NTPP (non-tangential proper part)
- TPPi (inverse of TPP)
- NTPPi (inverse of NTPP)
- EQ (equal)

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are the same spatial region. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some parts but neither is a part of the other. Since x is the same as y, x and z must have the same relationship that y and z have. So the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

I think my reasoning is correct. The answer is PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other)

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical spatial regions, x must have exactly the same relationship with z that y has with z. 

Since y partially overlaps with z, x must also partially overlap with z.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
