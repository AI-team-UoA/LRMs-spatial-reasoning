PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the relationships we're given.

- NTPPi(x,y) means that NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is a non-tangential proper part of x. That means y is completely contained in the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

- TPPi(y,z) means that TPP(z,y), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y. That means z is contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Given that y is completely contained within the interior of x (NTPPi(x,y)), and z is contained within y and touches y's boundary (TPPi(y,z)), let's think about the possibilities for the relationship between x and z.

Since z is contained within y (TPP(z,y)), and y is completely contained within x (NTPP(y,x)), it follows that z is contained within x. So, z is a proper part of x.

The question now is: does z touch the boundary of x? Let's analyze:
- z touches the boundary of y (since TPP(z,y)).
- y is completely in the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary (since NTPP(y,x)).

Given these facts, z cannot touch the boundary of x because z is contained within y, and y is completely in the interior of x, away from x's boundary. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me verify this by checking other possibilities:

- DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z is contained within y, which is contained within x, so z is within x.
  
- EC(x,z) means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors. This is not possible because z is within y, which is within the interior of x, so z is within the interior of x and cannot just touch at a boundary.
  
- PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. This is not possible because z is completely contained within y, which is contained within x, so z is completely within x.
  
- TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is not possible because y is a proper part of x, and z is a proper part of y, so x cannot be a part of z.
  
- NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is not possible for the same reason as above.
  
- TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z touches the boundary of x. But since z is contained within y, and y is in the interior of x (not touching x's boundary), z cannot touch the boundary of x.
  
- NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with what we've deduced: z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
  
- EQ(x,z) means x and z are coincident. This is not possible because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x and they cannot be coincident.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, NTPP(z,x)).

Hmm, I feel like I need to re-evaluate. Let me reason through this more carefully.

1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. So y is contained within the interior of x.
2. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, since z is contained within y, and y is contained within x, z is also contained within x. So the relationship between x and z is either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

To determine which one, I need to check if z touches the boundary of x. Since z touches the boundary of y, and y is completely in the interior of x (not touching x's boundary), z is also in the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try again. 

Actually, I need to think of it differently. Let me reason in terms of which regions are inside each other:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely contained within the interior of x.
2. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Given the above, z is contained within y, and y is contained within the interior of x. So, z is also contained within the interior of x.

The question is: does z touch the boundary of x? 

- z touches the boundary of y.
- y is completely within the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Since z is only known to touch the boundary of y, and y is entirely in the interior of x, z doesn't necessarily touch the boundary of x. In fact, since y is in the interior of x, any point on the boundary of y is in the interior of x. So, even though z touches the boundary of y, it doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just double-check this one more time:

NTPPi(x,y) means that NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

TPPi(y,z) means that TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

So what are the possible relations between x and z?

Well, since y is inside x, and z is inside y, it follows that z is inside x. So z is a proper part of x. Is it a tangential proper part (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part (NTPP)? In other words, does z touch the boundary of x?

Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, it follows that z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be more careful. When we say "TPP(z,y)", it means that z touches the boundary of y, but it doesn't mean that every point of the boundary of z touches the boundary of y. Some parts of the boundary of z might be completely in the interior of y.

Let me reconsider by thinking about it in terms of the boundary of z.

1. TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is contained within y and some part of the boundary of z touches the boundary of y.
2. NTPP(y,x) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y, including its boundary, is completely contained within the interior of x.

Given the above, the boundary of z can be divided into two parts: (a) parts that touch the boundary of y, and (b) parts that don't touch the boundary of y (i.e., they are in the interior of y).

Since the entire boundary of y is contained within the interior of x, any part of the boundary of z that touches the boundary of y is also in the interior of x. Similarly, any part of the boundary of z that's in the interior of y is also in the interior of x.

Therefore, the entire boundary of z is in the interior of x, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x), which is equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me once more reconsider.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

I want to find the relationship between x and z.

First, since z is a part of y and y is a part of x, z is a part of x. So, z is either a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)).

To determine which one, I need to check if z touches the boundary of x. 

Since z is a tangential proper part of y, some part of the boundary of z touches the boundary of y. And since y is a non-tangential proper part of x, the entire boundary of y is contained within the interior of x. So, any part of the boundary of z that touches the boundary of y is still within the interior of x.

Therefore, z doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x), which is equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

I feel confident in saying that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, hold on a moment. Let me think about this in another way to ensure I'm being careful. 

Here's a more careful analysis:

1. Let's define regions for x, y, and z.
2. Given NTPPi(x,y), y is completely within the interior of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
3. Given TPPi(y,z), z is within y and touches the boundary of y.

I want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since z is within y and y is within x, z is definitely within x. So, the possible relationships are:
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The distinction between these two is whether z touches the boundary of x.

Let's think about a specific example: Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching the boundary of x), and z is an even smaller circle inside y and touching the boundary of y.

In this example, z is within y, y is within x, so z is within x. Since z only touches the boundary of y and not the boundary of x, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x), which is equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

This confirms my previous reasoning. The relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

But now I'm second-guessing myself, and thinking that another spatial relation might be possible between x and z. Let's see:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.
2. TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Given these, z is definitely inside x. But could z touch the boundary of x? Initially, I said no because z only touches the boundary of y, and y is completely inside x, away from the boundary of x. However, I need to consider if z could somehow extend all the way to the boundary of x.

Let's think about it: If z were to touch the boundary of x, it would have to extend through y, because y is between z and the boundary of x. But we're given that z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is contained within y. So, z cannot extend beyond y to touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z cannot touch the boundary of x, confirming that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be even more careful. Let's think more directly about the TPPi(y,z) relation. This means TPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y. 

If I have a circle y, and a smaller circle z inside y that touches the boundary of y, then z is a TPP of y. In this case, part of the boundary of z touches the boundary of y, but other parts of the boundary of z might be completely inside y. 

Now, if y is a NTPP of x, then the entire boundary of y is inside the interior of x. That means any part of the boundary of z that touches the boundary of y is still inside the interior of x. And any part of the boundary of z that's inside y is also inside the interior of x. So, the entire boundary of z is inside the interior of x, making z a NTPP of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

I'm satisfied with this reasoning.

Actually, one last check: Could z possibly be EQ to x? No, because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x, which means z cannot be coincident with x.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think more systematically. 

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

I want to find the relationship between x and z, selecting from the possible RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ.

First, let's eliminate the clearly impossible ones:
- DC (disconnected): z is within y, and y is within x, so z and x share a region, and they're not disconnected.
- EC (externally connected): z is within y, and y is within x, so z is within x, not just touching at the boundary.
- PO (partially overlapping): z is completely within y, and y is completely within x, so z is completely within x, not just partially overlapping.
- TPP (tangential proper part): z is within y, and y is within x, so x is not a part of z.
- NTPP (non-tangential proper part): Same reason as above.
- EQ (coincident): z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x, not coincident with it.

This leaves TPPi and NTPPi. 

TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Since y is a non-tangential proper part of x, the boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of x. And since z is a tangential proper part of y, the boundary of z touches the boundary of y. But since the boundary of y is inside the interior of x, the boundary of z is also inside the interior of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x), which is equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, maybe I should stop assuming that there's only one possible relationship, and consider all the implications and what the various relationships would actually mean.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of y.

Let me reconsider each of the eight RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z is within y, and y is within x, so z is also within x.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior. This is not possible because z is within y, and y is within x, so z shares interior with x.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is not possible because z is completely within y, and y is completely within x, so z is completely within x, not just partially.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, x cannot be a part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is not possible for the same reason as above.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z would need to touch the boundary of x. But since z is within y, and y is within the interior of x (not touching the boundary of x), z cannot touch the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given the constraints, this seems to be the only possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. This is not possible because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x and cannot be coincident with it.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I missed something. Let me visualize this more clearly.

Imagine a big circle x. Inside it, there's a smaller circle y (not touching the boundary of x). Inside y, there's an even smaller circle z, touching the boundary of y. Given this, z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. 

This confirms that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

However, I just realized I might have been too restrictive. Let's re-examine each of the eight RCC-8 relations between x and z more systematically.

Actually, never mind. The visualization and reasoning above are sound. The only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

But let me once more check if there's anything I've missed. 

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

Let's check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) implies x and z are disconnected. This contradicts the fact that z is contained within y, which is contained within x.
2. EC(x,z) implies x and z are externally connected. This also contradicts the containment structure.
3. PO(x,z) implies x and z partially overlap. Since z is completely contained within y, which is completely contained within x, z is completely contained within x, not just partially.
4. TPP(x,z) implies x is a tangential proper part of z. This reverses the containment structure and contradicts that z is contained within y, which is contained within x.
5. NTPP(x,z) also reverses the containment structure and contradicts the given information.
6. TPPi(x,z) implies z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean that z touches the boundary of x. But z is contained within y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning y doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, z can't touch the boundary of x either.
7. NTPPi(x,z) implies z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with the given constraints.
8. EQ(x,z) implies x and z are identical. This contradicts the fact that z is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of x.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to consider a slightly different scenario to ensure I'm not missing anything. 

Imagine a big circle x. Inside it, there's a smaller circle y (not touching the boundary of x). Inside y, there's an even smaller circle z. But this time, imagine z is positioned in such a way that it touches the boundary of y at a point, and from that point, it extends outward, touching the boundary of x as well.

Is this scenario possible given the constraints?

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, the boundary of y is strictly inside the interior of x.

TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

So, is it possible for z to touch both the boundary of y and the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of y, it's at a point inside the interior of x. For z to also touch the boundary of x, it would have to extend outside of y. But if z extends outside of y, it's no longer a proper part of y, contradicting TPPi(y,z).

So, the scenario I described is not possible given the constraints.

This further confirms that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, I'm confident in my answer. The only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think there's another scenario I should check before finalizing.

Imagine a big circle x. Inside it, there's a shape y (not touching the boundary of x). This shape y has a concave part. Inside y, there's a shape z, which fits into the concave part of y and touches the boundary of y at that point. But the boundary of y at that point is very close to the boundary of x. Could z possibly extend from that point to touch the boundary of x as well?

Let's analyze this scenario. 

For y to be a non-tangential proper part of x, the entire boundary of y must be strictly inside the interior of x. This means there's some distance, however small, between the boundary of y and the boundary of x.

For z to be a tangential proper part of y, z must be inside y and touch the boundary of y. But z must still be completely inside y. If z were to extend outside of y, it would no longer be a proper part of y, contradicting TPPi(y,z).

So, in the scenario I described, even if the boundary of y is very close to the boundary of x, z can't extend outside of y to touch the boundary of x.

This reaffirms that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, actually, the issue is that TPPi(y,z) doesn't necessarily mean that z is a proper part of y. It means that y is a tangential proper part of z. So z would actually be larger than y.

Actually, I mixed up the interpretation. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So, z is indeed inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Given that, I revert to my previous reasoning. Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, z is inside x. Since y doesn't touch the boundary of x, and z doesn't extend outside of y, z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, so the only relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check one more time.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of y.

Looking at the structure, we have:
- y is contained within x, not touching the boundary of x.
- z is contained within y, touching the boundary of y.

Since z is contained within y, and y is contained within x, z is also contained within x. And since z only touches the boundary of y (not the boundary of x), z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident in this answer.

The relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given the conditions:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:
1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
2. TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary

To determine the relationship between x and z, I'll check each possibility:

Since z is inside y (as z is a tangential proper part of y), and y is inside x (as y is a non-tangential proper part of x), z must be inside x.

Does z touch x's boundary? Since z only touches y's boundary, and y is completely in the interior of x (not touching x's boundary), z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, making z a non-tangential proper part of x.

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
