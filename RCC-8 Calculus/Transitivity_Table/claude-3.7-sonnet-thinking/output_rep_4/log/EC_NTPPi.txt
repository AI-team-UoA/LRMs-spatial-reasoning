PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this systematically. We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), i.e., z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

First, let me understand what NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y) means in detail:
- z is completely inside y
- z doesn't touch y's boundary
- z is a proper part of y (so z â‰  y)

And EC(x,y) means:
- x and y touch at their boundaries
- x and y don't share any interior parts

Now, given these constraints, what are the possible relations between x and z?

Since x touches only the boundary of y, and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, this means x and z cannot be touching. There must be some part of y between x and z.

Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.
This means the relationship is DC(x,z).

Let me double-check by considering a simple example:
- Imagine y as a circle
- x is another circle touching y at one point (boundary contact)
- z is a smaller circle completely inside y, not touching y's boundary

In this scenario, x and z have no contact - they are disconnected.

So the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, I need to be a bit more careful. Let me think about this systematically by considering the constraints of each relation.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at boundary but don't share interior
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y, not touching y's boundary

Let's examine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   Since x only touches y's boundary, and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, x and z must be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at boundary only
   This would require x and z to share a boundary point. But since z doesn't touch y's boundary and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be touching. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This would require x and z to share some interior points. But since x doesn't share interior points with y, and z is completely inside y, x cannot share interior points with z. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   This would require x to be inside z and touch z's boundary. But z is completely inside y, and x only touches y's boundary, so x cannot be inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This would require x to be completely inside z. But since z is inside y and x touches y's boundary, x cannot be inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   This would require z to be inside x and touch x's boundary. But z doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, so z cannot touch x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This would require z to be completely inside x. But since z is inside y and x only touches y's boundary, z cannot be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical
   This would require x and z to occupy exactly the same space. But z is inside y and x only touches y's boundary, so they cannot be identical. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

Wait, I need to be even more careful. Let me revisit this.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y, not touching y's boundary

A key point is that NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely inside y, away from its boundary.

Since x only touches y at the boundary, and z is completely inside y away from the boundary, there is no way for x and z to be touching or overlapping.

Actually, let me think about this visually to be absolutely sure:

Imagine:
- y is a large circle
- z is a smaller circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- x is another region that touches y only at y's boundary

Since z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z must be disconnected.

So, the answer is DC(x,z).

Actually, I need to be careful about this reasoning. Let me consider a more precise example.

Let's say:
- y is a circle
- z is a smaller circle completely inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- x is another region that touches y exactly at y's boundary

From EC(x,y), we know that x doesn't share any interior points with y. Since z is completely inside y, z is part of y's interior. Therefore, x and z cannot share any points.

Given that x and z don't share any points, the only possible relation is DC(x,z).

So I confirm that the answer is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship(s) can exist between x and z given the specified conditions.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), so z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Let me analyze what these conditions mean for the relationship between x and z:

1) Since x only touches y at y's boundary (EC relation)
2) And z is completely inside y, away from y's boundary (NTPP relation)
3) Then x and z cannot share any points - they must be completely separate

Since x touches only the boundary of y, while z is entirely in the interior of y (not touching y's boundary), there must be some part of y between x and z.

Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
