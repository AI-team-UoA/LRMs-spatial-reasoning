PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what we know:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected. They share no spatial parts.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given these constraints.

Given DC(x,y), x and y do not overlap at all. Given NTPP(y,z), y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Let's go through each of the RCC-8 relations to see which ones are possible between x and z:

1. DC(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from y, and y is completely inside z, it's possible that x is also disconnected from z. For example, imagine x and y as two separate islands, and z as a larger island that contains y.
   So, DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

2. EC(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from y, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, it's possible that x touches the boundary of z. Imagine y as a small circle inside a larger circle z, and x as a circle that touches the boundary of z.
   So, EC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from y, and y is completely inside z, it's possible that x partially overlaps with z. Imagine y as a small circle inside a larger circle z, and x as a circle that overlaps partially with z but doesn't contain y.
   So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from y, and y is completely inside z, it's possible that x is a tangential proper part of z. Imagine y as a small circle inside a larger circle z, and x as another small circle inside z that touches the boundary of z.
   So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from y, and y is completely inside z, it's possible that x is also completely inside z without touching its boundary. Imagine y and x as two separate small circles inside a larger circle z, neither touching the boundary of z.
   So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   If x is disconnected from y, and y is completely inside z, it's possible that z is a tangential proper part of x? Let's think about this. If z is part of x, then y is also part of x (since y is part of z). But we know that DC(x,y), which means x and y don't share any parts. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   Similarly, if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then y is also part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z):
   If x and z are equal, then since y is a part of z, y would also be a part of x. But this contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

So, given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But I should double-check some of my reasoning to be sure. 

If NTPP(y,z), that means that y is inside z, away from z's boundary.

If DC(x,y), that means that x and y have no spatial parts in common.

So what can be the relationship between x and z?

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is definitely possible. If x is completely outside of z, then it would be disconnected from both y and z.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. This is possible. If x touches the boundary of z but doesn't enter it, then it would be disconnected from y (which is inside z, away from the boundary).

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. x could overlap with a part of z but not overlap with y.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. x could be inside z, touching z's boundary, and still be disconnected from y.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. x could be inside z, away from z's boundary, and still be disconnected from y.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But if z is inside x, then y is also inside x (since y is inside z). This contradicts DC(x,y), which says x and y are disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But if z is inside x, then y is also inside x (since y is inside z). This contradicts DC(x,y), which says x and y are disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If x and z are the same, then since y is inside z, y would also be inside x. This contradicts DC(x,y), which says x and y are disconnected. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But now I'm wondering if I made an error. Let's consider TPP(x,z). This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. Given NTPP(y,z), y is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, x and y are both inside z, but they might overlap or touch. However, DC(x,y) says they are disconnected. So, for TPP(x,z) to be possible, x and y need to be completely separate regions inside z. Let's confirm this is possible.

Yes, it is possible for x and y to be separate regions inside z, with x touching z's boundary and y not touching it. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), both x and y would be inside z, away from its boundary. As long as x and y don't overlap, which is ensured by DC(x,y), NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Let me also think about PO(x,z). This means x and z share some parts, but neither is a part of the other. Given NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z. For PO(x,z) to be consistent with DC(x,y), x should overlap with z but not with y. This is possible if x overlaps with a part of z that doesn't include y.

So, after careful consideration, the possible relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let me analyze:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Checking each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be completely outside z while y is inside z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z's boundary while y is fully inside z (away from boundary).

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap z without overlapping y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z touching z's boundary, while remaining disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z (not touching boundary) while still disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were part of x, then y would also be part of x (contradicting DC(x,y)).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as above.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be part of x (contradicting DC(x,y)).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
