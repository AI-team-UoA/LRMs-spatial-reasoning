PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's recall what TPP means:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is a proper part of y and x touches y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is a proper part of z and y touches z's boundary.

Given these two relations, I need to determine what the possible relations between x and z could be.

Since TPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper part of y. Since TPP(y,z), we know that y is a proper part of z. By transitivity of the "part of" relation, we can deduce that x is a proper part of z.

However, this doesn't fully specify the RCC-8 relation between x and z. We need to determine whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

There are two possibilities:

1. TPP(x,z): This would be the case if x touches the boundary of z.
2. NTPP(x,z): This would be the case if x does not touch the boundary of z.

Let's analyze these two cases more carefully:

Case 1: TPP(x,z)
If x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) holds. This is certainly possible. For example, imagine z as a big square, y as a smaller square inside z that touches one edge of z, and x as an even smaller square inside y that touches the same edge of z.

Case 2: NTPP(x,z)
If x does not touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) holds. This is also possible. For example, imagine z as a big square, y as a smaller square inside z that touches one edge of z, and x as an even smaller square inside y that doesn't touch any edge of z.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this answer by thinking about this more carefully.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (all of x is within y, and x is not equal to y)
- x touches the boundary of y

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z (all of y is within z, and y is not equal to z)
- y touches the boundary of z

Given these, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

First, since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, by transitivity, x is a proper part of z.

Now, there are two possible scenarios regarding how x is situated within z:

1. x touches the boundary of z. In this case, the relation is TPP(x,z).
2. x does not touch the boundary of z. In this case, the relation is NTPP(x,z).

Both scenarios are possible. Let me illustrate:

Scenario 1 (TPP(x,z)): Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z and touching the boundary of z at point P, and x as an even smaller circle inside y and also touching the boundary of z at point P. In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z.

Scenario 2 (NTPP(x,z)): Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z and touching the boundary of z at point P, and x as an even smaller circle inside y but not touching the boundary of z. In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

Let's triple-check by enumerating all possible RCC-8 relations and seeing which ones are consistent with our given conditions:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since x is a proper part of z, they cannot be disconnected. So, this is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x touches the boundary of z but doesn't overlap with z. But since x is a proper part of z, they overlap. So, this is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap partially. But since x is a proper part of z, all of x is within z. So, this is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. As we've seen, this is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. As we've seen, this is also possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. But since x is a proper part of z, z cannot be a proper part of x. So, this is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But since x is a proper part of z, z cannot be a proper part of x. So, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. But since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, x cannot be equal to z. So, this is not possible.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm not 100% confident in my analysis, because I'm trying to imagine spatial arrangements of these regions, and I might be overlooking certain possibilities. Let me approach this problem more systematically.

The constraint that TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. Similarly, TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's think about the constraints this puts on the relation between x and z:

Since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, x is a proper part of z. This means x is not equal to z, and x is fully contained within z.

The question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

Scenario 1: x touches the boundary of z.
In this case, TPP(x,z).

Scenario 2: x does not touch the boundary of z.
In this case, NTPP(x,z).

Both scenarios are possible. Let me illustrate with some examples:

Scenario 1 (TPP(x,z)): Consider regions represented as rectangles. Let z be a larger rectangle, y be a smaller rectangle inside z and touching the boundary of z, and x be an even smaller rectangle inside y and also touching the boundary of z (where y touches z).

Scenario 2 (NTPP(x,z)): Consider regions represented as rectangles. Let z be a larger rectangle, y be a smaller rectangle inside z and touching the boundary of z, and x be an even smaller rectangle inside y but not touching the boundary of z.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z when TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y
- x touches y's boundary

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z
- y touches z's boundary

Given these conditions, I can deduce:
1. Since x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, then x must be a proper part of z (by transitivity)

The question becomes: does x touch z's boundary or not? There are two possibilities:

1. x touches z's boundary: This would make TPP(x,z)
2. x does not touch z's boundary: This would make NTPP(x,z)

Both scenarios are possible:
- TPP(x,z) can happen when x touches the same part of z's boundary that y touches
- NTPP(x,z) can happen when x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
