PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this. We have NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). Let's understand what these mean:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is completely contained within y, without touching y's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely contained within z, without touching z's boundary.

So, we have:
- x is completely contained within y
- y is completely contained within z

Given these conditions, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since x is completely contained within y, and y is completely contained within z, it follows that x is also completely contained within z.

Now, we need to determine whether x touches z's boundary or not. Since x doesn't even touch y's boundary (because NTPP(x,y)), and y doesn't touch z's boundary (because NTPP(y,z)), it means that x definitely doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which is represented as NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Given these, it's clear that x is also a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z).

I'm not seeing any other possible relationships given the constraints. So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, actually, let me think again to make sure that NTPP is the only possible relationship.

Given that:
- x is completely contained within y without touching y's boundary.
- y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Could x be disconnected from z (DC)? No, because x is inside y, which is inside z.

Could x be externally connected to z (EC)? No, because x doesn't even touch y's boundary, let alone z's boundary.

Could x partially overlap with z (PO)? No, because x is completely contained within z.

Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)? No, because for x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would have to touch z's boundary. But as we've established, x doesn't even touch y's boundary, so it can't touch z's boundary.

Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)? No, because z contains y, which contains x, so z can't be a part of x.

Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)? No, for the same reason as above.

Could x be equal to z (EQ)? No, because x is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of z, so x can't be equal to z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think a bit more carefully about whether x can touch z's boundary.

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely contained within y without touching y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Since x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, it's clear that x can't touch z's boundary. The boundary of z is outside the boundary of y, and the boundary of y is outside the boundary of x. So, there's no way for x to touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Ok, to summarize, the answer is:

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to understand the implications of the given relationships and determine what they tell us about the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely contained within y without touching y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary

Since x is completely contained within y, and y is completely contained within z, it follows that x must be completely contained within z.

The next question is whether x touches z's boundary or not. Since:
- x doesn't touch y's boundary (by definition of NTPP)
- y doesn't touch z's boundary (by definition of NTPP)

It's impossible for x to touch z's boundary. For x to touch z's boundary, it would first need to reach y's boundary, which it doesn't.

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
