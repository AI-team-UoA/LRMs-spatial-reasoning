PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's consider the constraints we have:
1. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

Given these two constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space), and y and z are coincident (they also occupy exactly the same space), then by transitivity, x and z must also be coincident.

In other words, if EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EQ(x,z).

To be absolutely sure, let's consider each of the RCC-8 relations and see if any other relation besides EQ is possible for x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This would mean x and z share no spatial parts, which contradicts the fact that both x and z are coincident with y. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This also contradicts the fact that both x and z are coincident with y. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This would mean x and z share some spatial parts but neither is a part of the other. Again, this contradicts the fact that both x and z are coincident with y. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This contradicts the fact that x is coincident with y, which is coincident with z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This would mean x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This also contradicts the fact that x is coincident with y, which is coincident with z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This contradicts the fact that z is coincident with y, which is coincident with x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: This would mean z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This also contradicts the fact that z is coincident with y, which is coincident with x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This would mean x and z are coincident. This is consistent with the fact that both x and z are coincident with y. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Based on this analysis, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is EQ(x,z).

So the answer is: EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationship between x and z given EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space.

By transitivity, if x is coincident with y, and y is coincident with z, then x must be coincident with z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
