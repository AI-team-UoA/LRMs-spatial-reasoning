PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that $TPP(x, y)$ and $EC(y, z)$.

First, let me understand the constraints:

- $TPP(x, y)$ means that $x$ is a tangential proper part of $y$. This means $x$ is properly contained in $y$ and touches the boundary of $y$.

- $EC(y, z)$ means that $y$ and $z$ are externally connected. This means $y$ and $z$ touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now, I need to determine which of the RCC-8 relations can hold between $x$ and $z$. Let's go through them one by one:

1. $DC(x, z)$: This means $x$ and $z$ are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts. This is possible if $x$ is contained within $y$ in such a way that it doesn't touch the boundary of $y$ where $y$ touches $z$.

2. $EC(x, z)$: This means $x$ and $z$ touch at their boundaries but share no interior points. This is possible if $x$ touches the boundary of $y$ at the same place where $y$ touches $z$.

3. $PO(x, z)$: This means $x$ and $z$ partially overlap, sharing some spatial parts, but neither is a part of the other. This doesn't seem possible under the given constraints, since $y$ and $z$ don't share any interior points (they only touch at their boundaries), and $x$ is fully contained within $y$.

4. $TPP(x, z)$: This means $x$ is a tangential proper part of $z$, touching $z$'s boundary. This doesn't seem possible under the given constraints, since $x$ is fully contained within $y$, and $y$ only touches $z$ at their boundaries.

5. $NTPP(x, z)$: This means $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $z$, not touching $z$'s boundary. This doesn't seem possible under the given constraints, since $x$ is fully contained within $y$, and $y$ only touches $z$ at their boundaries, not overlapping with $z$.

6. $TPPi(x, z)$: This means $z$ is a tangential proper part of $x$, touching $x$'s boundary. This doesn't seem possible under the given constraints, since $x$ is fully contained within $y$, and $y$ only touches $z$ at their boundaries.

7. $NTPPi(x, z)$: This means $z$ is a non-tangential proper part of $x$, not touching $x$'s boundary. This doesn't seem possible under the given constraints, since $x$ is fully contained within $y$, and $y$ only touches $z$ at their boundaries.

8. $EQ(x, z)$: This means $x$ and $z$ are equivalent or coincident. This doesn't seem possible under the given constraints, since $x$ is fully contained within $y$, and $y$ only touches $z$ at their boundaries.

Actually, let me think more carefully. Let me reconsider the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that $TPP(x, y)$ and $EC(y, z)$.

1. $DC(x, z)$: If $x$ is inside $y$ but does not touch the part of $y$'s boundary that touches $z$, then $x$ and $z$ would be disconnected. This is possible.

2. $EC(x, z)$: If $x$ is inside $y$ and touches the part of $y$'s boundary that touches $z$, then $x$ and $z$ would be externally connected. This is possible.

3. $PO(x, z)$: This would require $x$ and $z$ to share some interior points, but since $y$ and $z$ only touch at their boundaries and $x$ is entirely within $y$, it's not possible for $x$ and $z$ to share interior points. So, this is not possible.

4. $TPP(x, z)$: This would require $x$ to be properly contained in $z$ and to touch $z$'s boundary. But since $y$ and $z$ only touch at their boundaries and $x$ is entirely within $y$, it's not possible for $x$ to be properly contained in $z$. So, this is not possible.

5. $NTPP(x, z)$: This would require $x$ to be properly contained in $z$ and not to touch $z$'s boundary. But since $y$ and $z$ only touch at their boundaries and $x$ is entirely within $y$, it's not possible for $x$ to be properly contained in $z$. So, this is not possible.

6. $TPPi(x, z)$: This would require $z$ to be properly contained in $x$ and to touch $x$'s boundary. But since $y$ and $z$ only touch at their boundaries and $x$ is entirely within $y$, it's not possible for $z$ to be properly contained in $x$. So, this is not possible.

7. $NTPPi(x, z)$: This would require $z$ to be properly contained in $x$ and not to touch $x$'s boundary. But since $y$ and $z$ only touch at their boundaries and $x$ is entirely within $y$, it's not possible for $z$ to be properly contained in $x$. So, this is not possible.

8. $EQ(x, z)$: This would require $x$ and $z$ to be the same region. But since $y$ and $z$ only touch at their boundaries and $x$ is entirely within $y$, it's not possible for $x$ and $z$ to be the same region. So, this is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that $TPP(x, y)$ and $EC(y, z)$ are:
- $DC(x, z)$
- $EC(x, z)$

But let's check this once more to be sure. 

The condition $TPP(x, y)$ means that $x$ is a tangential proper part of $y$. This means that $x$ is inside $y$ and touches the boundary of $y$ at at least one point. 

The condition $EC(y, z)$ means that $y$ and $z$ are externally connected. This means they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

So, the question is, what is the relation between $x$ and $z$?

Given that $x$ touches the boundary of $y$ (because of $TPP(x, y)$), there are two possibilities:
1. $x$ touches the boundary of $y$ at a point where $y$ touches $z$ (because of $EC(y, z)$). In this case, $x$ would also touch $z$, making the relation $EC(x, z)$.
2. $x$ touches the boundary of $y$ at a point where $y$ does not touch $z$. In this case, $x$ would not touch $z$, making the relation $DC(x, z)$.

So, the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ are:
- $DC(x, z)$ (disconnected)
- $EC(x, z)$ (externally connected)

Actually let me draw pictures to make sure I'm not missing anything:

Scenario 1 (DC):
```
    +------+
    |   x  |
    +------+      +------+
    |      |      |      |
    |  y   |------|  z   |
    |      |      |      |
    +------+      +------+
```

In this scenario, x is a tangential proper part of y (it touches y's boundary), and y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries). But x does not touch z, so they are disconnected.

Scenario 2 (EC):
```
    +------+
    |   x  |
    +------+
    |      |      +------+
    |  y   |------|  z   |
    |      |      |      |
    +------+      +------+
```

In this scenario, x is a tangential proper part of y (it touches y's boundary at the same place where y touches z), and y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries). Since x touches z, they are externally connected.

I don't see any way for x and z to have any other relationship given the constraints. So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)

Actually, let me consider some other possibilities carefully:

Could x and z partially overlap (PO)? No, because y and z only touch at their boundaries, and x is entirely within y. So, x and z can't share any interior points.

Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)? No, because y and z only touch at their boundaries, and x is entirely within y. So, x can't be properly contained in z.

Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)? No, for the same reason as above.

Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)? No, because y and z only touch at their boundaries, and x is entirely within y. So, z can't be properly contained in x.

Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)? No, for the same reason as above.

Could x and z be the same region (EQ)? No, because y and z only touch at their boundaries, and x is entirely within y. So, x and z can't be the same region.

So, indeed, the only possible relationships between x and z given the constraints are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)

ANSWER:

Given the information:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (contained in y and touches y's boundary)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points)

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Analyzing the constraints:
- Since x is entirely within y (touching y's boundary)
- And y only touches z at their boundaries

There are only two possible configurations:

1. x touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches z:
   In this case, x and z would touch at their boundaries but share no interior points.
   This gives us EC(x,z).

2. x touches y's boundary at a different point than where y touches z:
   In this case, x and z would have no connection at all.
   This gives us DC(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible given the constraints.
