PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is contained in y and does not touch the boundary of y.

Let's think about what these relations imply about the relationship between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This implies that y is completely contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x at some point.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This implies that z is completely contained within y, and z does not touch the boundary of y at any point.

Now, given these relations, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

Since z is completely contained within y (NTPPi(y,z)), and y is completely contained within x (TPPi(x,y)), it follows that z is completely contained within x. This means that z is either a tangential proper part of x (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP).

To determine which one it is, we need to consider whether z touches the boundary of x:

Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPPi(y,z)), and y is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,y)), z does not touch the boundary of y. Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y might touch the boundary of x, it's clear that z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this.

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is properly contained within x and touches x's boundary at some point.

If NTPPi(y,z), then z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained within y and does not touch y's boundary at any point.

Given these two conditions, z is properly contained within y, which is in turn properly contained within x. So, z is properly contained within x.

Since z does not touch the boundary of y, and y might touch the boundary of x, it follows that z is strictly inside x and does not touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which can be expressed as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, hang on. Let me think about this more carefully. I need to be more rigorous.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is properly contained within x.
- y touches the boundary of x at some point.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is properly contained within y.
- z does not touch the boundary of y at any point.

Now, the question is: what is the relationship between x and z?

Since z is properly contained within y, and y is properly contained within x, it follows that z is properly contained within x. This eliminates the possibility of DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ as the relationship between x and z.

That leaves TPP and NTPP as potential relationships between z and x.

If z touches the boundary of x, then the relationship would be TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).
If z does not touch the boundary of x, then the relationship would be NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Given that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is inside x but may touch the boundary of x, can z touch the boundary of x?

The answer is no. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is the only part of x that z can possibly interact with, z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize I need to be more careful here. Let's think about this in terms of set relationships. A tangential proper part touching the boundary can touch it at a single point or along multiple points. And the way the boundary is touched can vary.

Let's reconsider:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper subset of x.
- y and the boundary of x have a non-empty intersection.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is a proper subset of y.
- z and the boundary of y have an empty intersection.

Now, the question is: what is the relationship between x and z?

Since z is a proper subset of y, and y is a proper subset of x, it follows that z is a proper subset of x. This eliminates the possibility of DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ as the relationship between x and z.

That leaves TPP and NTPP as potential relationships between z and x.

If z and the boundary of x have a non-empty intersection, then the relationship would be TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).
If z and the boundary of x have an empty intersection, then the relationship would be NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, this is a bit more complex than I initially thought. Let's approach it differently.

Actually, let's draw out a very simple example to clarify this. Imagine three concentric circles, with circle z inside circle y, which is inside circle x. Since circles y and z are completely inside circle x, and they don't touch the boundary of x, the relationship between z and x would be NTPP(z,x) (or NTPPi(x,z)).

But wait, the given relationship is TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y touches the boundary of x. So, our concentric circles analogy doesn't hold.

Let's refine our example. Imagine:
- Circle x is the largest circle.
- Circle y is inside circle x but touches the boundary of x at one point.
- Circle z is completely inside circle y and does not touch the boundary of y.

Given this scenario, is it possible for circle z to touch the boundary of circle x? 

No, it's not possible. The only way for circle z to touch the boundary of circle x would be if it also touched the boundary of circle y at the point where y touches x. But we're told that z doesn't touch the boundary of y, so it can't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Hang on, I'm having a realization. I've been thinking about this problem in terms of circles, which are specific shapes with specific properties. But the RCC-8 calculus is more general, allowing for arbitrary shaped regions in a topological space.

So, let me reconsider the problem. We want to know the possible relations between x and z. 

Let's consider the composition TPPi(x,y) ∘ NTPPi(y,z) and see what it gives us. 

In general, TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper subset of x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

And NTPPi(y,z) means:
- z is a proper subset of y.
- z does not touch the boundary of y.

Combining these, we can deduce that:
- z is a proper subset of y, which is a proper subset of x, so z is a proper subset of x. This eliminates the possibility of DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and EQ as the relationship between x and z.
- z does not touch the boundary of y, which means that z is completely inside y. If y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, then z, being completely inside y, cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a proper subset of x and does not touch the boundary of x, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let's just consider the mereotopological composition directly:

The composition of TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) gives us the possible relations between x and z. 

The standard RCC-8 composition table tells us that:

TPPi(x,y) ∘ NTPPi(y,z) = NTPPi(x,z)

This confirms our reasoning: the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Hmm, I don't have access to an RCC-8 composition table to check this. Let me reason through it once more from first principles.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x.
- y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is a proper part of y.
- z does not touch the boundary of y.

Given these two relationships, we want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, we know that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. By transitivity, z is a proper part of x. This eliminates the possibility of DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and EQ as the relationship between x and z.

Now, we need to determine if z touches the boundary of x. If it does, then the relationship would be TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z). If it doesn't, then the relationship would be NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Given that z does not touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, can z touch the boundary of x?

Let's think about it: For z to touch the boundary of x, it would need to have a point in common with the boundary of x. Since z is completely contained within y, the only way for z to touch the boundary of x would be if there's a part of y that touches both the boundary of x and z.

But we're given that z does not touch the boundary of y. This means there's a gap between z and the boundary of y. Since the boundary of y separates z from the outside of y, and part of the outside of y includes parts of x and the boundary of x, it follows that z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

I need to be a little bit more precise in my reasoning to make sure I'm right. Let's state things in terms of the topology:

TPPi(x,y) means:
- interior(y) ⊂ interior(x)
- boundary(y) ∩ boundary(x) ≠ ∅
- y ≠ x

NTPPi(y,z) means:
- interior(z) ⊂ interior(y)
- boundary(z) ∩ boundary(y) = ∅
- z ≠ y

Given these, we want to determine the relation between x and z.

We know that interior(z) ⊂ interior(y) ⊂ interior(x), so interior(z) ⊂ interior(x). This eliminates the possibility of DC, EC, and PO as the relationship between x and z. 

We also know that z ≠ y and y ≠ x, but that doesn't directly tell us whether z = x. However, given that interior(z) ⊂ interior(y) ⊂ interior(x) and both containments are strict (because z ≠ y and y ≠ x), it follows that interior(z) ⊂ interior(x) is also strict, so z ≠ x. This eliminates the possibility of EQ as the relationship between x and z.

Now, for the remaining relations (TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi), we need to determine the containment relation between x and z, as well as the relationship between their boundaries.

Given that interior(z) ⊂ interior(y) ⊂ interior(x), and both containments are strict, we have two possibilities: either z is a proper part of x, or x is a proper part of z. 

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, by transitivity, z is a proper part of x. This eliminates the possibility of TPPi and NTPPi as the relationship between x and z.

Now, we need to determine if z touches the boundary of x, which would distinguish between TPP and NTPP. 

We know that boundary(z) ∩ boundary(y) = ∅, meaning z does not touch the boundary of y. And boundary(y) ∩ boundary(x) ≠ ∅, meaning y touches the boundary of x.

For z to touch the boundary of x, we would need boundary(z) ∩ boundary(x) ≠ ∅. But since z is completely inside y, and boundary(z) ∩ boundary(y) = ∅, it's not possible for z to touch the boundary of x unless it first touches the boundary of y.

To see this, note that any path from a point in z to a point on the boundary of x must pass through the boundary of y, because z is inside y. If z were to touch the boundary of x, there would be a direct path, without crossing the boundary of y, which is not possible.

Therefore, boundary(z) ∩ boundary(x) = ∅, which means z does not touch the boundary of x.

Given that z is a proper part of x and does not touch the boundary of x, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

I've double checked my reasoning, and I believe the answer is correct. The relationship between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me triple check just to be certain.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Given these, we want to determine the relation between x and z.

First, we know that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. By transitivity, z is a proper part of x. This means z is either a tangential proper part (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part (NTPP) of x.

To determine which one it is, we need to check if z touches the boundary of x. 

Now, let me think about the mereotopological constraints here. z doesn't touch the boundary of y (given from NTPPi(y,z)). This means there's a "buffer" of points in y that surround z. 

Since y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x, there's at least one point on the boundary of y that coincides with the boundary of x. 

For z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to touch the boundary of y at a point where the boundary of y coincides with the boundary of x. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y at all, it can't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), is NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, there's something nagging at me. Just to triple check, let me spell out the logic a bit differently.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. y is a proper part of x.
2. There's at least one point where the boundary of y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. z is a proper part of y.
2. The boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these, we want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

From 1 and 3, we can deduce that z is a proper part of x. This eliminates the possibility of DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ as the relationship between x and z.

That leaves TPP and NTPP as potential relationships between z and x.

If z touches the boundary of x, then the relationship would be TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).
If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then the relationship would be NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Now, can z touch the boundary of x?

From 2, we know that there's at least one point where the boundary of y touches the boundary of x. From 4, we know that the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y. This means that z is surrounded by points in y.

For z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to touch the boundary of y at a point where the boundary of y touches the boundary of x. But from 4, we know that the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of y. So, z can't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), is NTPPi(x,z).

In this case, the relation is unambiguous, and the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize I'm making a potential mistake. When I write NTPPi(x,z), that would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But this is a reversal of the argument I've been making. I've been arguing that z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which would be NTPP(z,x). 

Let me check. Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we're trying to determine the relation between x and z. I concluded that z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This corresponds to NTPP(z,x).

NTPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is equivalent to NTPP(z,x). I think I've been conflating the two ways of representing the same relation. To be clear, the relation is:

NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Both mean that z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Let me make sure I'm interpreting these relations correctly:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This implies that x is a proper part of y and there's at least one point where the boundary of x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. It's the inverse relation of TPP, so it implies that y is a proper part of x and there's at least one point where the boundary of y touches the boundary of x.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This implies that x is a proper part of y and the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of y.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. It's the inverse relation of NTPP, so it implies that y is a proper part of x and the boundary of y doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we're trying to determine the relation between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

From these, we concluded that z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, there might be a misconception here. Let me reconsider the definitions of TPPi and NTPPi.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This is equivalent to TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these interpretations, z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. By transitivity, z is a proper part of x. 

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and there's a gap between z and the boundary of y, and since the boundary of y separates z from the outside of y, and the outside of y includes parts of x, it follows that z can't touch the boundary of x without first touching the boundary of y, which it doesn't do.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I've been overthinking this. Let me simplify:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these, z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. So, z is a proper part of x. This means the relation between z and x is either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

To determine which one, we need to check if z touches the boundary of x. 

Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, it can't touch the boundary of x at the points where y touches the boundary of x. And since z is completely inside y, it can't touch the boundary of x at any other points. Therefore, z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between z and x is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

In RCC-8 terms, the relation is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm double checking, and my interpretation was correct. If we're asked for the relation R(x,z), and the relation is NTPP(z,x), then the answer is NTPPi, not NTPP. The "i" in TPPi and NTPPi stands for "inverse", which means the arguments are reversed. So, NTPPi(x,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,x).

So, the answer is NTPPi.

But wait, I need to double-check, if we're asked for the relation between x and z, the correct syntax is R(x,z), where R is one of the eight RCC-8 relations. 

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we deduced that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) in RCC-8. But the question is asking for the relation between x and z, which is the inverse, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the correct answer is:

The possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, hold on. In a question like "what are the possible relationships between x and z?", we are being asked for the relation R such that R(x,z) holds, not necessarily R(z,x). So, the answer is NTPPi.

But I want to double check that I haven't made any errors in my reasoning. Let's think once more about the problem:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Given these, we deduced that z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is represented as NTPP(z,x) in RCC-8. 

But the question is asking for the relation between x and z, which is the inverse of NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi.

I'm still a bit confused about how we specify our answers. The question asks for the "possible relationships between x and z", which suggests to me we should give a relation R such that R(x,z).

Let's be explicit about the constraints:

1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.
3. Given (1) and (2), z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, so z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
4. In RCC-8, if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, this is represented as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).
5. The relation between x and z is the relation R such that R(x,z) holds.
6. Given (4), the relation that holds for (x,z) is NTPPi.

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi.

OK, so the "relation between x and z" is the relation R such that R(x,z). Given our constraints, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) in RCC-8. The relation R such that R(x,z) is the inverse of NTPP, which is NTPPi. So, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think the confusion is stemming from the notation. In RCC-8, the relation NTPP(a,b) means "a is a non-tangential proper part of b." The relation NTPPi(a,b) means "b is a non-tangential proper part of a," which is equivalent to NTPP(b,a).

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we deduced that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) in RCC-8. 

The question is asking for the relation between x and z, which is the relation R such that R(x,z) holds. In RCC-8, if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, the relation R such that R(x,z) holds is NTPPi.

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi.

I'd like to double-check that I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question asks for the "possible relationships between x and z", which I take to mean the relation R such that R(x,z) holds, given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we deduced that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) in RCC-8. The inverse of this relation, which relates x to z, is NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), or simply NTPPi.

Actually, let's check whether I'm correct about the notation. I believe I am: 

TPP(a, b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b.
TPPi(a, b) means that b is a tangential proper part of a, which is equivalent to TPP(b, a).
NTPP(a, b) means that a is a non-tangential proper part of b.
NTPPi(a, b) means that b is a non-tangential proper part of a, which is equivalent to NTPP(b, a).

So, given:
TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We deduced that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) in RCC-8. The relation between x and z, which is the relation R such that R(x,z) holds, is NTPPi(x,z), or simply NTPPi.

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi.

Actually, let me do a complete check of my understanding of the RCC-8 relations to make sure I'm correct.

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, which means they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means x is a proper part of y and x doesn't touch the boundary of y.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, which is equivalent to TPP(y,x).
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is equivalent to NTPP(y,x).
8. EQ(x,y): x is equal to y.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We deduced that z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In RCC-8, this is represented as NTPP(z,x).

The question asks for the relation between x and z, which is the relation R such that R(x,z) holds. Given our deduction, the relation R such that R(x,z) holds is NTPPi(x,z), or simply NTPPi.

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi.

OK, I'm confident that the relation between x and z is NTPPi.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

We want to determine the relation between x and z.

We know that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. By transitivity, z is a proper part of x. This means the relation between z and x is either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

To determine which one, we need to check if z touches the boundary of x. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is inside x, z can't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x).

The relation between x and z, which is the relation R such that R(x,z) holds, is NTPPi(x,z), or simply NTPPi.

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi.

But let me check this one more time for completeness. TPPi(x,y) states that y is a tangential proper part of x. That means:
1. y is a proper part of x.
2. y touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) states that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. That means:
1. z is a proper part of y.
2. z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these, z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. By transitivity, z is a proper part of x. This means the relation between z and x is either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

To determine which one, we need to check if z touches the boundary of x. Let's carefully trace through the constraints again.

z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

For z to touch the boundary of x, it would have to touch the boundary of y at a point where the boundary of y touches the boundary of x. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, it can't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPP(z,x).

The relation between x and z, which is the relation R such that R(x,z) holds, is NTPPi(x,z), or simply NTPPi.

Therefore, the answer is NTPPi.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relation holds between x and z given the two constraints.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is completely contained in y without touching y's boundary.

From these facts, I can deduce:
1. Since z is completely contained in y (from NTPPi(y,z))
2. And y is completely contained in x (from TPPi(x,y))
3. Therefore, z is completely contained in x by transitivity

Now I need to determine if z touches the boundary of x. For this to happen, z would need to touch y at a point where y touches the boundary of x. However, we know that z doesn't touch the boundary of y at all (from NTPPi(y,z)). Since z is completely inside y and doesn't reach y's boundary, z cannot possibly reach x's boundary.

Therefore, z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary, which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This relation is expressed as NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
