{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given the information:\n- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)\n- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts\n\nSince x and y are spatially identical (EQ(x,y)), x must have exactly the same relationship with z as y does with z. \n\nSince y and z are in the EC relation (externally connected), then x and z must also be externally connected.\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 8.387853622436523, "reasoning-tokens": 393, "completion-tokens": 393}
