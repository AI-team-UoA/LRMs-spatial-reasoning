PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the constraints we have: 
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is part of z and does not touch the boundary of z.

Now I need to determine what relation(s) could hold between x and z.

First, I'll go through the possible relations and see which ones are consistent with the given constraints:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? 
   If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), then x could be completely outside of z, making x and z disconnected. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundary but don't share interior parts.
   Since y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, x could touch z's boundary as well. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap.
   If y is completely inside z, and x touches y's boundary, x could partially overlap with z. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
   If y is completely inside z, and x touches y's boundary, x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
   This seems contradictory with EC(x,y) because if x touches y's boundary and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x cannot be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
   This contradicts NTPP(y,z) because if z is part of x, then y cannot be completely inside z (as z would be smaller than y). So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
   This also contradicts NTPP(y,z) for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical.
   This contradicts both EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) because if x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y should be the same as between z and y, which is not the case. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me double-check these by reasoning more carefully:

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundary but don't share interior parts.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): If x touches y only at the boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could be completely outside of z. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): If x touches y only at the boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could touch z at its boundary. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): If x touches y only at the boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could partially overlap with z. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): If x touches y only at the boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x touches y only at the boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x cannot be completely inside z without touching z's boundary because x touches y which is inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Wait, I need to think about this more carefully. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then could x also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

Actually, I think NTPP(x,z) is possible. If x is very small and only touches y at a point on y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Let me check this with a concrete example. Imagine z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x is a tiny circle that touches y at exactly one point on y's boundary. In this case, x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) holds.

So I need to revise my answer: NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Let's re-check the other relations again:

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
   This contradicts NTPP(y,z) because if z is part of x, then y cannot be completely inside z (as z would be smaller than y). So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
   This also contradicts NTPP(y,z) for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical.
   This contradicts both EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) because if x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y should be the same as between z and y, which is not the case. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me try to visualize this more carefully:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundary.
NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): x is completely outside of z.
   This is possible. If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, x could be completely outside of z.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z at z's boundary.
   This is possible. If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, x could touch z at z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
   This is possible. If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, x could partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
   This is possible. If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
   This is possible, as I explained above.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
   This contradicts NTPP(y,z) because if z is part of x, then y cannot be completely inside z (as z would be smaller than x and y together). So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
   This also contradicts NTPP(y,z) for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical.
   This contradicts both EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) because if x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y should be the same as between z and y, which is not the case. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Wait, let me reconsider this last point, because I think I was mistaken. If x is very small and only touches y at y's boundary, but y is completely inside z, then how could x be identical to z? That's not possible, so EQ(x,z) is indeed not a possibility.

Let me make sure I have the definitions of the relationships right:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they share no parts).
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundary but share no interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some parts, but neither is contained in the other).
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and touches y's boundary).
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and does not touch y's boundary).
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and touches x's boundary).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and does not touch x's boundary).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal (they have the same parts).

Given these definitions, let's reconsider our problem:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundary but share no interior parts.
NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could be completely outside of z.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z at z's boundary but shares no interior parts with z.
   This is possible. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could touch z at z's boundary but share no interior parts with z.

3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z (they share some parts, but neither is contained in the other).
   This is possible. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is contained in z and touches z's boundary).
   This is possible. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is contained in z and does not touch z's boundary).
   I initially thought this was possible, but let me reconsider. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

Let's think of a concrete example: z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a small circle that touches y at y's boundary. In this case, x is not completely inside y, but it could be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) a possibility.

Actually, wait. I think I might have been wrong initially. Let me try again with a clearer example:

Imagine z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a small circle that touches y at exactly one point on y's boundary. Now, x is not completely inside y (it just touches y at the boundary), but x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) a possibility.

So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is contained in x and touches x's boundary).
   This contradicts NTPP(y,z) because if z is contained in x, then y cannot be completely inside z (as z would be smaller than the combination of x and y). So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is contained in x and does not touch x's boundary).
   This also contradicts NTPP(y,z) for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal (they have the same parts).
   This contradicts both EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) because if x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y should be the same as between z and y, which is not the case. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I'm having second thoughts about NTPP(x,z).

Let's review the definition: NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

If EC(x,y), then x touches y at y's boundary. If NTPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

So the question is: if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

Let's consider a concrete example again: z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a small circle that touches y at exactly one point on y's boundary. 

In this case, is x completely inside z without touching z's boundary? Yes, it can be. x just needs to be small enough and positioned such that it touches y at y's boundary but is still completely inside z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Actually, let me double-check all of these by visualizing a concrete example:

Imagine z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a small circle.

1. DC(x,z): x is completely outside of z.
   This is possible. x can touch y at y's boundary while being completely outside of z.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z at z's boundary but shares no interior parts with z.
   This is possible. x can touch y at y's boundary and also touch z at z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z (they share some parts, but neither is contained in the other).
   This is possible. x can touch y at y's boundary and partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is contained in z and touches z's boundary).
   This is possible. x can touch y at y's boundary, be completely inside z, and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is contained in z and does not touch z's boundary).
   This is possible. x can touch y at y's boundary, be completely inside z, and not touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (z is contained in x and touches x's boundary).
   This is not possible. If z contains y, and y touches x, then z cannot be contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is contained in x and does not touch x's boundary).
   This is not possible for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal (they have the same parts).
   This is not possible. If x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y would be the same as between z and y, which is not the case.

Actually, wait. I'm being too loose with the term "touching." Let me be more precise.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundary but share no interior parts. This means there's at least one point that belongs to both the boundary of x and the boundary of y, but the interiors of x and y are disjoint.

NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This means every point of y (including its boundary) is inside the interior of z.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected (they share no points).
   This seems possible. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could be completely outside of z.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z at z's boundary but shares no interior parts with z.
   This is possible. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could touch z at z's boundary but share no interior parts with z.

3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z (they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other).
   This is possible. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (every point of x is in z, and at least one boundary point of x is on the boundary of z).
   This is possible. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (every point of x is in the interior of z).
   This is possible. If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (every point of z is in x, and at least one boundary point of z is on the boundary of x).
   This contradicts NTPP(y,z) because if every point of z is in x, then y cannot be completely inside z (as z would be smaller than the combination of x and y). So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (every point of z is in the interior of x).
   This also contradicts NTPP(y,z) for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal (they have exactly the same points).
   This contradicts both EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) because if x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y should be the same as between z and y, which is not the case. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's check these answers once more with a more precise understanding of the terminology.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundary but share no interior parts. This means there's at least one point that belongs to both the boundary of x and the boundary of y, but the interiors of x and y are disjoint. In other words, the intersection of x and y is non-empty, but the intersection of their interiors is empty. The only shared points are boundary points.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means every point of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z. In other words, y is completely surrounded by z, with some space between the boundary of y and the boundary of z.

Given these definitions, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected (they share no points).
   If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z, can x be completely outside of z? No, this is not possible. If x touches y, and y is completely inside z, then x must at least touch z. So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Actually, let me reconsider this. If x and y touch at their boundary, and y is completely inside z, could x be completely outside of z? No, because if y is completely inside z, then every point of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z. If x touches y at y's boundary, then x must share at least one point with the interior of z, so x and z cannot be disconnected.

So, DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z at z's boundary but shares no interior parts with z.
   If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z, can x touch z at z's boundary without sharing any interior parts? No, because if y is completely inside z, then every point of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z. If x touches y at y's boundary, then x must share at least one point with the interior of z, so x and z cannot be externally connected.

So, EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z (they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other).
   If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z, can x partially overlap with z? Yes, x can share some interior points with z (specifically, the boundary point(s) of y that x touches), but x is not completely contained in z, and z is not completely contained in x.

So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

Actually, wait. Let me be more careful about the definition of "touch." If x and y touch at their boundary, it means they share at least one boundary point. So there's at least one point p such that p is on the boundary of x and p is on the boundary of y.

Now, if y is completely inside z, then every point of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z. So the point p, which is on the boundary of y, is in the interior of z.

But if p is on the boundary of x, and p is in the interior of z, then x and z must share at least one interior point. This means they cannot be disconnected, so DC(x,z) is indeed not a possibility.

But can they be externally connected? If x and z are externally connected, they share at least one boundary point, but no interior points. But we've already established that x and z must share at least one interior point (the point p). So EC(x,z) is also not a possibility.

Can they partially overlap? If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is possible. The point p, which is on the boundary of x and in the interior of z, is a shared interior point. But x need not be completely contained in z, and z need not be completely contained in x.

So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (every point of x is in z, and at least one boundary point of x is on the boundary of z).
   If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z, can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, every point of x could be in z, and at least one boundary point of x could be on the boundary of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (every point of x is in the interior of z).
   If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z, can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, every point of x could be in the interior of z. Remember, the point p, which is on the boundary of x and on the boundary of y, is in the interior of z. If every other point of x is also in the interior of z, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (every point of z is in x, and at least one boundary point of z is on the boundary of x).
   If y is completely inside z, can z be a tangential proper part of x? No, because if y is completely inside z, and x touches y, then z cannot be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (every point of z is in the interior of x).
   This also contradicts NTPP(y,z) for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal (they have exactly the same points).
   This contradicts both EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) because if x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y should be the same as between z and y, which is not the case. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I'm still not convinced I have the correct interpretation of "touching." Let me go back to the definition of EC:

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundary but share no interior parts. This means there's at least one point that belongs to both the boundary of x and the boundary of y, but the interiors of x and y are disjoint.

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means every point of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z.

Now, let's be very precise about what it means for a point to be on the boundary or in the interior. A point is on the boundary of a region if every neighborhood of the point contains both points in the region and points outside the region. A point is in the interior of a region if there's a neighborhood of the point that's completely contained in the region.

Given these definitions, if y is completely inside z, then every point of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z. And if x touches y at their boundary, then there's at least one point p that belongs to both the boundary of x and the boundary of y. This point p is in the interior of z (because it's on the boundary of y), so it's not on the boundary of z.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected (they share no points).
   If x and y share a boundary point p, and p is in the interior of z, then x and z share the point p. So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z at z's boundary but shares no interior parts with z.
   If x and y share a boundary point p, and p is in the interior of z, then x and z share the interior point p. So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z (they share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other).
   If x and y share a boundary point p, and p is in the interior of z, then x and z share at least one interior point. If x is not completely contained in z, and z is not completely contained in x, then x and z partially overlap. This is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (every point of x is in z, and at least one boundary point of x is on the boundary of z).
   If x is completely contained in z, and at least one boundary point of x is on the boundary of z, then x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that x and y share a boundary point p, and p is in the interior of z, it's still possible for x to have another boundary point that's on the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (every point of x is in the interior of z).
   If every point of x, including its boundary, is in the interior of z, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Given that x and y share a boundary point p, and p is in the interior of z, it's possible for every other boundary point of x to also be in the interior of z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x (every point of z is in x, and at least one boundary point of z is on the boundary of x).
   If every point of z is in x, then every point of y is in x (because y is completely inside z). But this contradicts EC(x,y), which states that x and y only share boundary points. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x (every point of z is in the interior of x).
   This also contradicts EC(x,y) for the same reason as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal (they have exactly the same points).
   This contradicts both EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) because if x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y should be the same as between z and y, which is not the case. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This is my final answer. Let me just double-check once more:

EC(x,y) means x and y share at least one boundary point, but no interior points.
NTPP(y,z) means every point of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z.

The boundary point(s) shared by x and y is/are in the interior of z.

DC(x,z) is not possible because x and z must share the boundary point(s) of x and y, which is/are in the interior of z.

EC(x,z) is not possible because the shared point(s) between x and z include(s) the boundary point(s) of x and y, which is/are in the interior of z. So x and z share interior points, not just boundary points.

PO(x,z) is possible if x is not completely contained in z, and z is not completely contained in x, but they share at least one interior point (the boundary point(s) of x and y, which is/are in the interior of z).

TPP(x,z) is possible if every point of x is in z, and at least one boundary point of x is on the boundary of z.

NTPP(x,z) is possible if every point of x, including its boundary, is in the interior of z.

TPPi(x,z) is not possible because if every point of z is in x, then every point of y is in x (because y is completely inside z). But this contradicts EC(x,y), which states that x and y only share boundary points.

NTPPi(x,z) is not possible for the same reason as above.

EQ(x,z) is not possible because if x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y should be the same as between z and y, which is not the case.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I think I was too quick to dismiss DC(x,z) and EC(x,z). Let me think through this more carefully.

EC(x,y) means x and y share at least one boundary point, but no interior points.
NTPP(y,z) means every point of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z.

If x and y share a boundary point p, and p is on the boundary of y, then p is in the interior of z. If p is also on the boundary of x, then x and z share at least one point p, which is in the interior of z.

So, DC(x,z) is not possible because x and z must share at least one point (the boundary point(s) of x and y, which is/are in the interior of z).

Is EC(x,z) possible? If x and z are externally connected, they share at least one boundary point, but no interior points. But we've already established that x and z share at least one interior point of z (the boundary point(s) of x and y, which is/are in the interior of z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Is PO(x,z) possible? If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is possible. The point p, which is on the boundary of x and on the boundary of y, is in the interior of z. If x is not completely contained in z, and z is not completely contained in x, then x and z partially overlap.

Let me try a concrete example to check: z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a shape that touches y at y's boundary and extends outside of z. In this case, x and z share some interior points (including the point where x touches y), but neither is completely contained in the other. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

Is TPP(x,z) possible? If x is a tangential proper part of z, every point of x is in z, and at least one boundary point of x is on the boundary of z. Given that x and y share a boundary point p, and p is in the interior of z, it's still possible for x to be completely contained in z and have another boundary point that's on the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

For a concrete example: z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a small shape that touches y at y's boundary, is completely inside z, and also touches z at z's boundary. In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z.

Is NTPP(x,z) possible? If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, every point of x, including its boundary, is in the interior of z. Given that x and y share a boundary point p, and p is in the interior of z, it's possible for every other boundary point of x to also be in the interior of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

For a concrete example: z is a large circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a small shape that touches y at y's boundary and is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

So our final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), I need to understand the implications of these constraints:

1. EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundary but share no interior parts.
2. NTPP(y,z) means y is completely contained in z without touching z's boundary.

Given these facts, I'll analyze what relationships are possible between x and z:

First, since y is completely in the interior of z (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), x must share at least one point with the interior of z (the point where x touches y).

This immediately rules out:
- DC(x,z): impossible because x must share at least one point with z
- EC(x,z): impossible because x shares an interior point of z, not just boundary points

For the remaining relations:
- PO(x,z): possible - x can partially overlap with z
- TPP(x,z): possible - x can be completely inside z while touching z's boundary
- NTPP(x,z): possible - x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary
- TPPi(x,z): impossible - contradicts NTPP(y,z)
- NTPPi(x,z): impossible - contradicts NTPP(y,z)
- EQ(x,z): impossible - contradicts EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
