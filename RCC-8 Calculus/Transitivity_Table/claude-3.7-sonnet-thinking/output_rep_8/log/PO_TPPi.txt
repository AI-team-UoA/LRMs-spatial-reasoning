PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z. This means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

We want to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about the constraints:
1. x and y partially overlap.
2. z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

a) DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. 
This is possible. Since z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary, it's possible that x and z do not share any spatial parts, especially if x overlaps with the part of y that does not include z.

b) EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
This is possible. x and y partially overlap, and z is a proper part of y that touches y's boundary. If the boundary of z that touches y's boundary also touches the boundary of x, then x and z can be externally connected.

c) PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
This is possible. x and y partially overlap, and z is a proper part of y. If the overlap between x and y includes a part of z (but not all of z), then x and z can partially overlap.

d) TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
This seems impossible because z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y but is not a part of y. Since x is not a part of y, it cannot be a part of a subregion of y (which is z).

e) NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
Similarly, this seems impossible. Since x is not a part of y, it cannot be a part of a subregion of y (which is z).

f) TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
This is possible. x and y partially overlap, and z is a proper part of y. If z is entirely contained within the overlap of x and y, and z touches the boundary of x, then z can be a tangential proper part of x.

g) NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
This is possible. If z is entirely contained within the overlap of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z can be a non-tangential proper part of x.

h) EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
This seems impossible. Since x partially overlaps with y (and is not a part of y), and z is a proper part of y, x and z cannot be the same region.

Let me double-check my reasoning.

Actually, let me reconsider TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
Given that z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, can x be a tangential proper part of z? 
If x is a part of z, then x is also a part of y (since z is a part of y). But we're given that PO(x,y), which means x is not a part of y. So, TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
Again, if x is a part of z, then x is also a part of y. But this contradicts PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is also impossible.

Now, let's reconsider TPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
Given that z is a proper part of y, can z also be a tangential proper part of x? Since x and y partially overlap, and z is a proper part of y, it's possible for z to be entirely contained within the overlap of x and y. Moreover, z can touch the boundary of x. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Now, let's reconsider NTPPi(x,z).

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
Similarly, given that z is a proper part of y, can z also be a non-tangential proper part of x? Since x and y partially overlap, and z is a proper part of y, it's possible for z to be entirely contained within the overlap of x and y. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z can be a non-tangential proper part of x. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Lastly, let's reconsider EQ(x,z).

EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
Given that z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y (and is not a part of y), can x and z be the same region? No, they can't. If x and z are the same, then x is a proper part of y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Actually let's draw out some diagrams in a 1D example to double-check.

Suppose the universe is the interval [0, 10].

For PO(x,y), let's say x = [0, 6] and y = [3, 10]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 6].

For TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, let's say z = [8, 10]. It's a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

In this case, the relation between x and z is DC(x,z) because x = [0, 6] and z = [8, 10], which are disconnected.

But this is just one example. Let's try another:

Suppose the universe is the interval [0, 10].

For PO(x,y), let's say x = [0, 6] and y = [3, 10]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 6].

For TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, let's say z = [3, 5]. It's a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

In this case, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z) because x = [0, 6] and z = [3, 5]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 5], but neither is a part of the other.

Let's try one more:

Suppose the universe is the interval [0, 10].

For PO(x,y), let's say x = [0, 6] and y = [3, 10]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 6].

For TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, let's say z = [3, 6]. It's a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Wait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, not that y is a tangential proper part of z.

So, for TPPi(y,z), this means that TPP(z,y), which implies that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let me redo the examples.

Suppose the universe is the interval [0, 10].

For PO(x,y), let's say x = [0, 6] and y = [3, 10]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 6].

For TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y), let's say z = [3, 4]. z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

In this case, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z) because x = [0, 6] and z = [3, 4]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 4], but neither is a part of the other.

Sorry, I need to be even more careful. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y, not the other way around. TPPi means the inverse relation of TPP.

So, for TPPi(y,z), z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, y is the part and z is the whole.

Oh wait, that doesn't make sense. TPPi(y,z) should mean that y is a tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. So, y is the part and z is the whole.

Let me clarify the definitions:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of TPP, so TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) means that TPP(z,y), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y.

Actually, let me revisit the original definitions:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's try the examples again:

Suppose the universe is the interval [0, 10].

For PO(x,y), let's say x = [0, 6] and y = [3, 10]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 6].

For TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y), let's say z = [3, 4]. z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Actually, I think I'm still getting confused. Let me make sure I understand the definitions correctly.

Let's assume:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP, so TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.

Then, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

Now, let's proceed with the examples:

Suppose the universe is the interval [0, 10].

For PO(x,y), let's say x = [0, 6] and y = [3, 10]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 6].

For TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, let's say z = [3, 4]. z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

In this case, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z) because x = [0, 6] and z = [3, 4]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 4], but neither is a part of the other.

Let's try another example:

For PO(x,y), let's say x = [0, 6] and y = [3, 10]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 6].

For TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, let's say z = [7, 8]. z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

No, this is incorrect because if z is a tangential proper part of y, then z should touch y's boundary. Let me adjust:

For TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, let's say z = [9, 10]. z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

In this case, the relation between x and z is DC(x,z) because x = [0, 6] and z = [9, 10], which are disconnected.

Now, let's try an example where z overlaps with the overlap of x and y:

For PO(x,y), let's say x = [0, 6] and y = [3, 10]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 6].

For TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, let's say z = [5, 7]. z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

In this case, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z) because x = [0, 6] and z = [5, 7]. They partially overlap in the region [5, 6], but neither is a part of the other.

Let's try one more example where z is entirely contained within the overlap of x and y:

For PO(x,y), let's say x = [0, 6] and y = [3, 10]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 6].

For TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, let's say z = [3, 5]. z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

In this case, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z) because x = [0, 6] and z = [3, 5]. They partially overlap in the region [3, 5], but neither is a part of the other.

Wait, I'm not checking all the possibilities. Let me think more generally.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is a part of y and touches y's boundary.

Possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible. Consider the example where x = [0, 6], y = [3, 10], and z = [9, 10]. Here, x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
   I think this is possible. If z touches the boundary of y, and that boundary coincides with the boundary of x, then x and z can be externally connected.

   Actually, let me check this with an example. Let's say x = [0, 3], y = [2, 10], and z = [2, 4]. Here, x and y partially overlap in the region [2, 3], and z is a tangential proper part of y (it's a proper part of y and touches y's boundary). Now, the relation between x and z is EC(x,z) because they only touch at the boundary point 3.

   Wait, I made an error. If z is a tangential proper part of y, then z touches y's boundary, not the boundary of their overlap. So, let's adjust: Let's say x = [0, 3], y = [2, 10], and z = [2, 4]. Here, x and y partially overlap in the region [2, 3], and z is a tangential proper part of y (it's a proper part of y and touches y's boundary at point 2). Now, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z) because they overlap in the region [2, 3], but neither is a part of the other.

   Let me try another example: Let's say x = [0, 3], y = [3, 10], and z = [3, 4]. Here, x and y only touch at the boundary point 3, which means EC(x,y), not PO(x,y).

   Ah, I see the error. I need to ensure that x and y have a partial overlap.

   Let's say x = [0, 5], y = [3, 10], and z = [3, 4]. Here, x and y partially overlap in the region [3, 5], and z is a tangential proper part of y (it's a proper part of y and touches y's boundary at point 3). Now, the relation between x and z is PO(x,z) because they overlap in the region [3, 4], but neither is a part of the other.

   Actually, EC(x,z) should be possible if z touches the boundary of y where it coincides with the boundary of x. Let me check this with an example.

   Let's say x = [0, 3], y = [2, 10], and z = [2, 3]. Here, x and y partially overlap in the region [2, 3], and z is a tangential proper part of y (it's a proper part of y and touches y's boundary at point 2). Now, the relation between x and z is TPP(x,z) because z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

   Actually, the previous example didn't show EC. Let me think again.

   The reason I'm struggling is because if z is a tangential proper part of y, then z touches the boundary of y. If x partially overlaps with y, and z is in the region where x and y overlap, then it's hard to see how x and z can be externally connected. They would likely either be disconnected or have some overlap.

   Actually, I need to be even more careful. EC(x,z) means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. In 1D, this means they share a boundary point. In the context of the given constraints, can x and z share a boundary point but not overlap? Let's see...

   If z is a tangential proper part of y, then z touches the boundary of y. If z is in the region where x and y overlap, then it's likely that x and z would also overlap. But what if z only touches the part of y's boundary where it also meets x's boundary? 

   Let's say x = [0, 3], y = [3, 10], and z = [3, 4]. Here, y and z touch at the boundary point 3, and z is a tangential proper part of y. But in this case, x and y are EC, not PO.

   Let me try again with x = [0, 5], y = [3, 10], and z = [3, 4]. Here, x and y partially overlap in the region [3, 5], and z is a tangential proper part of y. In this case, x and z partially overlap in the region [3, 4].

   Hmm, it's challenging to find an example for EC(x,z). Let me think more creatively.

   In a 2D context, if x and y partially overlap, and z is a tangential proper part of y that touches the boundary of y, can x and z be externally connected? Let's consider if z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x, but z touches the boundary of y where x also touches it.

   Given the constraints, I think EC(x,z) is possible, but it's a bit challenging to find a simple 1D example. In a 2D setting, it would be easier to visualize.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
   This is possible. In the example where x = [0, 6], y = [3, 10], and z = [5, 7], x and z partially overlap in the region [5, 6].

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This seems implausible. If z is a proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, then x cannot be a proper part of z. However, let me think more carefully.

   If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z, which means x is a proper part of y (since z is a proper part of y). But this contradicts the fact that x and y partially overlap, where neither is part of the other. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Again, this seems implausible. If x is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. Imagine a case where z is entirely contained within the overlap of x and y, and z touches the boundary of x. 

   For example, let's say x = [0, 6], y = [2, 10], and z = [2, 3]. Here, x and y partially overlap in the region [2, 6], and z is a tangential proper part of y. In this case, z is also a tangential proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. Imagine a case where z is entirely contained within the overlap of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

   For example, let's say x = [0, 6], y = [2, 10], and z = [3, 5]. Here, x and y partially overlap in the region [2, 6], and z is a tangential proper part of y. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   This seems implausible. If x and z are the same, then z would also partially overlap with y (not be a proper part of y), which contradicts TPPi(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me check if I have exhausted all the possibilities. I considered:

1. DC(x,z): Possible.
2. EC(x,z): Let me check more carefully in a 2D setting. Ahh, now I understand. Let me try to draw it:

Suppose x is a square from (0,0) to (3,3), and y is a square from (2,2) to (5,5). Their overlap is the square from (2,2) to (3,3).

Now, let z be a small square from (4,4) to (5,5). z is a tangential proper part of y (touching y's boundary at the corner (5,5)).

In this case, x and z are disconnected. So the relationship is DC(x,z).

But what if z is a small square from (3,3) to (4,4)? z is still a tangential proper part of y (touching y's boundary along the edges). In this case, x and z only touch at the corner (3,3), which means they are externally connected. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

Actually I'm still struggling a bit in the 2D case. Let me try to reason more carefully.

We have PO(x,y), which means x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

We also have TPPi(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

For EC(x,z), x and z should touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts.

Let's think in a 2D setting:
- x and y partially overlap, creating an overlap region.
- z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

If z is positioned within y such that it only touches the boundary of the overlap region without intersecting its interior, and that boundary is also a part of x's boundary, then x and z would be externally connected.

But is this setup consistent with the given constraints? Let's see.

If z is a tangential proper part of y, it means z is inside y and touches y's boundary. This boundary might be shared with x in the overlap region or might be outside the overlap region.

If z touches the boundary of y that's outside the overlap region, then x and z would be disconnected.

But if z touches the boundary of y that's shared with x in the overlap region, then z would be touching the boundary of the overlap region, which is also a part of x's boundary. In this case, x and z would be externally connected.

This makes sense! So, EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me continue:

3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible.

I think I have exhauted all possible relationships between x and z.

To reiterate, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me double check my answer. I'm not fully confident in my answer, and want to double-check it carefully.

Let's think about DC(x,z) again. 

DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected. Is this possible given the constraints?

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

If z is entirely within y and doesn't overlap with the part of y that overlaps with x, then x and z would be disconnected. This is definitely possible. For instance, if y is a square from (0,0) to (4,4), x is a square from (3,3) to (6,6), and z is a square from (0,0) to (1,1), then x and z are disconnected.

So, DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Now, let's consider EC(x,z).

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Is this possible given the constraints?

If z is positioned such that it touches the boundary of y that's also shared with x, then x and z would be externally connected. This is possible. For instance, if y is a square from (0,0) to (4,4), x is a square from (2,2) to (6,6), and z is a square from (2,0) to (3,2), then x and z are externally connected (they touch at the line segment from (2,2) to (3,2)).

Actually, I'm still struggling a bit with the EC(x,z) relationship. In the above example, if z is a square from (2,0) to (3,2), then z would overlap with x in the region from (2,2) to (3,2), not just touch. But then they wouldn't be externally connected, but rather have a partial overlap.

I'm having a hard time coming up with a concrete 2D example for EC(x,z), but I believe it should be possible. If z touches the boundary of y, and this boundary is also shared with x, then x and z could be externally connected.

Let me try a different approach. In a 1D context (line), we have three regions: x, y, and z. If x = [0, 3], y = [2, 6], and z = [2, 4], then x and y partially overlap in the region [2, 3], and z is a tangential proper part of y (since z is inside y and touches y's boundary at point 2). In this case, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z), as they overlap in the region [2, 3].

But if we change it to x = [0, 2], y = [2, 6], and z = [2, 4], then x and y touch at the point 2, which is EC(x,y), not PO(x,y). This doesn't meet our original constraints.

For EC(x,z), we need a case where x and z only touch at a boundary point. Let's think about this further.

Ah, I think I got it. In a 2D setting, if y is a square from (0,0) to (4,4), x is a square from (2,2) to (6,6), and z is a square from (0,2) to (2,3), then x and y partially overlap in the square from (2,2) to (4,4), z is a tangential proper part of y (since z is inside y and touches y's boundary along the edge from (0,2) to (2,2)), and x and z are externally connected (they touch along the line segment from (2,2) to (2,3)).

Wait, in the above example, z isn't entirely inside y. z should be a proper part of y. Let me try again.

If y is a square from (0,0) to (4,4), x is a square from (2,2) to (6,6), and z is a square from (1,1) to (2,3), then x and y partially overlap in the square from (2,2) to (4,4), z is a tangential proper part of y (since z is inside y and touches y's boundary along the edge from (1,2) to (2,2)), and x and z are externally connected (they touch along the line segment from (2,2) to (2,3)).

Actually, in the last example, z touches the boundary of y at the edge from (1,2) to (2,2), but this isn't the part of y's boundary that's shared with x. Let me try one more time.

If y is a square from (0,0) to (4,4), x is a square from (2,2) to (6,6), and z is a square from (2,0) to (4,2), then x and y partially overlap in the square from (2,2) to (4,4), z is a tangential proper part of y (since z is inside y and touches y's boundary along the edge from (2,0) to (4,0)), and x and z are externally connected (they touch along the line segment from (2,2) to (4,2)).

Hang on, let me check that again carefully. The square from (2,0) to (4,2) would have corners at (2,0), (4,0), (2,2), and (4,2). And the square from (2,2) to (6,6) would have corners at (2,2), (6,2), (2,6), and (6,6). But then the intersection of these two squares is the point (2,2), which means EC, not PO. Wait no, the two squares would overlap the small square from (2,2) to (4,2), so it would be PO(x,z) not EC(x,z).

I'm overthinking this. Let me simplify. If z is a tangential proper part of y and touches the boundary of y that's shared with x, then x and z would be externally connected. This seems possible given the constraints.

Actually, let's think in a slightly different way. For EC(x,z), x and z should only share a boundary, not any interior parts. But if x and y partially overlap, and z is a tangential proper part of y, then z can either be in the overlapping region of x and y (in which case x and z would have a non-empty intersection, so not EC), or z can be outside the overlapping region (in which case x and z would be disconnected, so not EC).

But actually, that's not quite right. z can be partially in the overlapping region and partially outside, such that it touches the boundary of the overlap. In that case, x and z could be externally connected.

Let me visualize this in a 2D setting:
- Let x be a square from (0,0) to (3,3).
- Let y be a square from (2,2) to (5,5).
- Let z be a square from (2,1) to (3,2).

In this case, x and y partially overlap in the region from (2,2) to (3,3). z is a tangential proper part of y (it's inside y and touches y's boundary along the edge from (2,1) to (3,1)). The relationship between x and z is EC(x,z) because they only touch along the line segment from (2,2) to (3,2).

Actually, wait. The square from (2,1) to (3,2) has corners at (2,1), (3,1), (2,2), and (3,2). And the square from (0,0) to (3,3) has corners at (0,0), (3,0), (0,3), and (3,3). So the two squares intersect in the line segment from (2,2) to (3,2). But this means their interiors don't intersect, which is EC(x,z).

But wait, that doesn't seem right. The interiors do intersect. The square from (2,1) to (3,2) has an interior that includes points like (2.5, 1.5). The square from (0,0) to (3,3) has an interior that includes points like (2.5, 2.5). But these two points are different, so the interiors don't intersect.

I'm making an error somewhere. Let me go back to basics.

For two squares to be externally connected, they should share a boundary (edge or corner) but not any interior points. In a 2D Cartesian plane, the interior of a square (a,b) to (c,d) consists of all points (x,y) such that a < x < c and b < y < d. The boundary consists of the four edges: (a,b) to (c,b), (c,b) to (c,d), (c,d) to (a,d), and (a,d) to (a,b).

So, for EC(x,z), x and z should share a boundary but not any interior points.

In the example I gave, the square from (2,1) to (3,2) has an interior of all points (x,y) such that 2 < x < 3 and 1 < y < 2. The square from (0,0) to (3,3) has an interior of all points (x,y) such that 0 < x < 3 and 0 < y < 3. These interiors don't intersect because there's no point (x,y) that satisfies both 2 < x < 3 and 1 < y < 2, AND 0 < x < 3 and 0 < y < 3. Wait, that's not right. The point (2.5, 1.5) satisfies both conditions, so the interiors do intersect.

I think I need to be more careful with the endpoints. The interior of a square from (a,b) to (c,d) consists of all points (x,y) such that a < x < c and b < y < d. The boundary includes the points where x = a, x = c, y = b, or y = d.

So, in the example, the square from (2,1) to (3,2) has an interior of all points (x,y) such that 2 < x < 3 and 1 < y < 2. The square from (0,0) to (3,3) has an interior of all points (x,y) such that 0 < x < 3 and 0 < y < 3. These interiors intersect in the region where 2 < x < 3 and 1 < y < 2, which is non-empty.

I need to adjust the example for EC(x,z). If x is a square from (0,0) to (2,2) and z is a square from (2,1) to (4,3), then they share the boundary point (2,2) but not any interior points.

But then in this example, x and y wouldn't partially overlap, they would be externally connected.

Hmm, actually, I think my conceptualization is wrong. I think I'm overthinking this. Let me go back to the basic 1D line examples, where the relationships are more clear to me.

In the line context, for EC(x,z), x and z should touch at a point but not share any intervals. For example, x = [0, 2] and z = [2, 4] are externally connected because they touch at the point 2 but don't share any intervals.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

If x = [0, 3], y = [2, 6], and z = [2, 4], then x and y partially overlap in the interval [2, 3], and z is a tangential proper part of y (since z is inside y and touches y's boundary at point 2). In this case, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z), as they overlap in the interval [2, 3].

But, if x = [0, 2], y = [1, 5], and z = [2, 4], then x and y partially overlap in the interval [1, 2], and z is a tangential proper part of y (since z is inside y and touches y's boundary at point 2). In this case, the relationship between x and z is EC(x,z), as they touch at the point 2 but don't share any intervals.

Actually, I just realized that in the latter case, x and z should share intervals. If x = [0, 2] and z = [2, 4], then they don't overlap in any segment.

It's hard to picture a situation where x and z would be externally connected. If they're EC, then they only share boundary points and not interior points. But if x and y partially overlap, and z is a tangential proper part of y, then it seems like x and z would either overlap or be disconnected, based on the position of z.

Or I just overthinking? Let me simplify.

Givne PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y, that means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. If z is entirely contained in the part of y that doesn't overlap with x, then x and z are disconnected (DC). If z is partially or entirely in the overlap of x and y, then x and z have a partial overlap (PO).

But for EC(x,z), z would need to touch x only at a boundary. Given the constraints, is this possible? If z is a tangential proper part of y and touches the boundary of y that's shared with x, then x and z might only share a boundary point, which would make them externally connected.

Let's say, for simplicity, that y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius the 3, x is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 2, and z is a small circle centered at (-2,0) with radius 0.5. Then, x and y partially overlap (PO), z is a tangential proper part of y (TPPi), but x and z are disconnected (DC). So that's a valid case.

Now, let's try to find a case for EC(x,z). If y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3, x is a circle centered at (3,0) with radius 2, and z is a small circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3, then x and y partially overlap (PO), z is a tangential proper part of y (TPPi), and x and z are externally connected (EC) because they touch at the point (3,0).

Actually, wait. In the latter case, z is not a tangential proper part of y; rather, z is the same as y, which isn't a proper part at all. Let me try again.

If y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3, x is a circle centered at (3,0) with radius 2, and z is a small circle centered at (0,3) with radius 0.5, then x and y partially overlap (PO), z is a tangential proper part of y (TPPi), and x and z are disconnected (DC).

Hmm, it's still hard to get an example for EC(x,z). Let me think more about it.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's go back to the constraints:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

From these, can x and z be externally connected (EC)? If z is inside y and touches the boundary of y, and this boundary is also shared with x, then x and z could be externally connected. This seems plausible.

Let me continue with the other relationships:

3. PO(x,z): This is possible, as demonstrated in several examples.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, and x partially overlaps with y, is it possible for x to be a proper part of z? 

   If x is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of y, then x is a proper part of y. But we know that x and y partially overlap, which means x is not a proper part of y. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Using the same reasoning as above, if x is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. For instance, if y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3, x is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 2, and z is a small circle centered at (2,1) with radius 0.5, then x and y partially overlap (PO), z is a tangential proper part of y (TPPi), and z is also a tangential proper part of x (TPPi).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. For instance, if y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3, x is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 2, and z is a small circle centered at (1,0) with radius 0.5, then x and y partially overlap (PO), z is a tangential proper part of y (TPPi), and z is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi).

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then z would also partially overlap with y (not be a proper part of y), which contradicts TPPi(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

As per the analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

OK, this finally aligns with my previous answers, which gives me confidence. Let me reflect once more on EC(x, z) to make sure I've understood this correctly. In summary:

- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

I want to find an example where EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

My intuition is telling me that this is challenging, since if z is inside y and touches y's boundary, and x partially overlaps with y, it seems like x and z would either overlap in the region where x and y overlap, or they would be disconnected if z is in the non-overlapping part of y.

But actually I can see a way now:

Suppose y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3, x is a circle centered at (3,0) with radius 2, and z is a small circle centered at (3,0) with radius 1. Then, x and y partially overlap (PO), z is a tangential proper part of y (TPPi) because it touches y's boundary at the point (3,0), and x and z are also in the TPPi(x,z) relationship (z is a tangential proper part of x).

Wait, that's not EC(x,z). In this case, z is inside x (it's a proper part of x), so it's TPPi(x,z).

I need to find a case where x and z only touch at a boundary.

Suppose y is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3, x is a circle centered at (3,0) with radius 2, and z is a small circle centered at (2.5, 1.5) with radius 1. Then, x and y partially overlap (PO), z is entirely within y (so it's a part of y), and it might touch the boundary of y. If z touches the boundary of y at a point that's also on the boundary of x, then x and z would be externally connected (EC). But this setup might not be geometrically possible given the constraints.

Here's a simpler approach: If x and y partially overlap, and z is a tangential proper part of y that touches the boundary of y where it meets the boundary of x, then x and z would be externally connected (EC). This seems plausible, but I'm not confident that I can provide a concrete geometric example.

Let me visualize this situation. I have a region y. Inside y, there's a smaller region z that touches the boundary of y. Additionally, there's a region x that partially overlaps with y. The question is, can z touch the boundary of y in such a way that it touches the boundary of x but doesn't overlap with x?

Hmm, let me think creatively. What if y has a complex shape? For instance, y could be a region with a "bay" or an indentation, and z could be a smaller region inside this bay. x could overlap with a part of y but not with the bay. In this setup, z could touch the boundary of y where it forms the bay, and x could also touch this same boundary without overlapping with z.

But actually this might not be possible. TPPi(y, z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. But if y has a complex shape with a "bay" and z is inside this bay, then z might not be a proper part of y (it could be disconnected from the rest of y). I'm a bit unsure.

Alright, I'm finding it hard to visualize a concrete 2D example for EC(x,z) given the constraints. But I believe it's possible in theory.

To recap, based on the constraints (PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z)), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I understand EC(x, z) to be possible: For a concrete case, I'm struggling to provide a simple geometrically valid example, but in a more complex, non-circular or non-square region of space, this should be possible.

So, in answer to the original question, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what possible spatial relationships can exist between regions x and z, given the constraints PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other)
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if z is contained in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z touches the boundary of y at exactly the point where the boundaries of x and y meet.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if z partially extends into the region where x and y overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would be contained in z, which is contained in y. This would make x contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is entirely contained within the overlap region of x and y, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is entirely contained within the overlap region of x and y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, z would partially overlap with y rather than being a proper part of y.
