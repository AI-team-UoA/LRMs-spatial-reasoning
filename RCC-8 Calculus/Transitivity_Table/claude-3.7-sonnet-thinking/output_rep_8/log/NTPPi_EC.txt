PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step-by-step.

First, let's recall the definitions of the relations:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. In other words, y is properly inside x.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

So we have:
- y is properly inside x (NTPPi(x,y))
- y and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap (EC(y,z))

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that y is properly inside x and y touches z at the boundary, z must at least touch x's boundary or possibly go inside x to some extent. But z cannot be completely inside x because it touches y at the boundary, and y does not touch x's boundary.

Let's consider the possible relationships one by one:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is not possible because if y touches z and y is inside x, then z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This is possible. If z touches y at y's boundary, and y is properly inside x, then z can touch x at x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This is possible. z can overlap with a part of x while also extending outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This is not possible. If z were a tangential proper part of x, then z would be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. But then z would have to be separate from y or overlapping with y, not just touching y at the boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This is not possible. If z were entirely inside x without touching x's boundary, it couldn't touch y at the boundary either, because y is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: This is possible. x could be a proper part of z, touching z's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: This is not possible. If x were entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y would also be entirely inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This is not possible. If x and z were the same region, then y would have to both be properly inside z (because y is properly inside x) and touch z at the boundary (because EC(y,z)), which is a contradiction.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) - Externally connected
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse

Actually, let's double-check my reasoning.

For DC(x,z), I said it's not possible because if y touches z and y is inside x, then z must at least touch x. That's correct.

For EC(x,z), I said it's possible if z touches y at y's boundary and y is properly inside x, then z can touch x at x's boundary. But I need to be more precise here. If y is properly inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y at the boundary, can z just touch x at the boundary without overlapping with x? 

Let's think about this in terms of points and regions. If y is a region that's properly inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a region that touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y, then z must have some points that are outside of x (since z touches y, which is fully inside x). But can z touch x only at the boundary?

Actually, I think I made a mistake. If y is properly inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z touches y at the boundary, then z must actually overlap with x to some extent, not just touch it at the boundary. This is because to touch y, which is strictly inside x, z must penetrate into x at least a little bit.

So EC(x,z) should not be possible. Let me reconsider the options.

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Not possible, as explained before.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Not possible. If z touches y at y's boundary, and y is properly inside x, then z must overlap with x to some extent, not just touch it at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This is possible. z can overlap with a part of x (including y's boundary) while also extending outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: Not possible, as explained before.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: Not possible, as explained before.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse: This is possible. x could be a proper part of z, touching z's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse: Not possible, as explained before.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Not possible, as explained before.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping
- TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse

Actually, let me carefully double-check my reasoning here. 

Let's clarify what we know: 
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.

So, y is inside x, and z touches y at the boundary.

For a point to be on the boundary of y, it must be in y but also adjacent to points that are not in y. Since y is completely inside x, all points on the boundary of y are inside x. Now, if z touches y at the boundary, z must have points that are adjacent to the boundary of y, which are still inside x.

So, z must overlap with x. But z cannot be completely inside x because that would mean either z is separate from y (DC), which contradicts EC(y,z), or z overlaps with y (PO), which also contradicts EC(y,z).

Since z must overlap with x but cannot be completely inside x, the possible relations are:
- PO(x,z): z partially overlaps with x.
- TPPi(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap.

Actually, EC(x,z) would mean that x and z only touch at a boundary, but we've established that z must have points inside x. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Ok, let me reconsider this problem more carefully.

We have:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
2. EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

First, since y and z touch at their boundaries, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, z must have at least some points inside x. This is because the boundary of y is inside x.

Second, z cannot be completely inside x because if it were, then either:
- z would be disconnected from y (DC), which contradicts EC(y,z).
- z would overlap with y (PO), which also contradicts EC(y,z).
- z would be a tangential proper part of y (TPP), which again contradicts EC(y,z).
- z would be a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP), which contradicts EC(y,z).
- z would be equal to y (EQ), which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, z must have some points outside of x.

Given these constraints, let's check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z must have some points inside x, as explained above.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This doesn't seem possible because z has to touch y, which is strictly inside x. So z must penetrate into x, not just touch its boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. z can have some points inside x (where it touches y) and some points outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is not possible because if x is completely inside z, then y would also be completely inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is even less possible than TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This doesn't seem possible because if z is completely inside x and touches y (which is strictly inside x), then z shouldn't be able to touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is definitely not possible because z has to have points outside of x, as we established earlier.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because if x and z were the same, then y would have to be completely inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, the only possible relation seems to be:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.

Hmm, I think I've been overthinking this. Let me reconsider with a clear mind.

We have:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
2. EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, the boundary of y is inside x.

Since z touches y at y's boundary, z has points that are adjacent to points on y's boundary, which are inside x.

But z and y are externally connected, meaning they don't share any interior points. So, z has points that are inside x but outside of y.

Now, z could be completely inside x, or it could extend beyond x's boundary. Let's consider both cases.

If z is completely inside x, it could be:
- EC(y,z): This is already given.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Since y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries), and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, z could be completely inside x or it could touch x's boundary. Both are consistent with the given constraints.

If z extends beyond x's boundary, it could be:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means they share some interior points, but each has points that the other doesn't.
- TPPi(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This means they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Wait, the last one doesn't make sense. If x and z are externally connected, they don't share interior points. But we've established that z has points inside x. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Actually, let me reconsider EC(x,z) more carefully. We have that y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y at y's boundary. Can x and z be externally connected?

Let's think of it this way: If x and z are externally connected, they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points. But since y is inside x and z touches y, z must have points inside x. So, x and z can't be externally connected.

This confirms that the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of TPPi(x,z). This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., TPP(x,z), which means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is completely inside z, then y is also completely inside z (since y is inside x). But that contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't overlap.

This doesn't seem right.

Okay, let's break down the conditions more explicitly:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

2. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap in their interiors.

Now, what can we infer about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is inside x (without touching x's boundary) and z touches y at the boundary, z must extend into x at least a bit. But z can't be completely inside x because if it were, and it touches y at the boundary, then it would have to overlap with y, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, z must have some points inside x (where it touches y) and some points outside x.

The possible relations between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z touches y, which is inside x, so z must have points inside or at least touching x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This doesn't seem possible because if z touches y, which is strictly inside x, then z must extend inside x, not just touch its boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. z can have some points inside x (where it touches y) and some points outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is not possible because if x is completely inside z, then y would also be completely inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is even less possible than TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This doesn't seem possible because if z is completely inside x and touches y (which is strictly inside x), then z shouldn't be able to touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is definitely not possible because if z touches y, which doesn't touch x's boundary, then z is also strictly inside x without touching x's boundary. But this would mean z and y are not externally connected, which contradicts EC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because if x and z were the same, then y would have to be completely inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, the only possible relation seems to be:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.

But actually, let me carefully reconsider TPPi(x,z). I've been saying it's not possible because "if z is completely inside x and touches y (which is strictly inside x), then z shouldn't be able to touch x's boundary." But that's not quite right. TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This doesn't contradict the fact that z also touches y, which is strictly inside x.

Let's see if there are any contradictions. If z is completely inside x (TPP(z,x)) and touches y at the boundary (EC(y,z)), does this lead to any contradictions? I don't think so. Both y and z can be inside x, with y not touching x's boundary and z touching x's boundary, and y and z can touch at their boundaries.

So, TPPi(x,z) (which means TPP(z,x)) is also a possible relation.

Actually, I made a critical error. TPPi(x,z) doesn't mean z is a tangential proper part of x. It means x is a tangential proper part of z. So TPPi(x,z) means TPP(x,z), which means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x). But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't overlap. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the only possible relation is PO(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think I'm making an error in my reasoning. Let's consider TPPi(x,z) correctly. TPPi(x,z) means TPP(z,x), which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, can it also touch y at y's boundary, where y is strictly inside x? Yes, it can. There's no contradiction here.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Wait, I'm making the same error again. Let me be clear:
- TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. This means a is inside b and touches b's boundary.
- TPPi(a,b) means TPP(b,a), which means b is inside a and touches a's boundary.

So, TPPi(x,z) means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

I'm getting confused with the "i" notation. Let's use the direct definitions:
- TPP(z,x) means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z) means x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

OK, so I just have to get the basic definitions aligned. Let's restate them:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): This is the same as TPP(y,x), which means y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y): This is the same as NTPP(y,x), which means y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Given these definitions:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

For x and z, the possibilities are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z touches y, which is inside x, so z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This doesn't seem possible because z touches y, which is strictly inside x, so z must extend inside x, not just touch its boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. z can have some points inside x (where it touches y) and some points outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This is not possible because if x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. z can be inside x, touch x's boundary, and also touch y, which is strictly inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible because if z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, it can't be externally connected to y, which is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. This is not possible because if x and z are the same, then y can't be inside z and touch z's boundary at the same time, which is required by the given conditions.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

But wait, let me double-check TPPi(x,z). I had said it's possible, but I want to make sure that's true. 

Let's say z is inside x and touches x's boundary. And y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. We're given that y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. 

Now, if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z also touches y at the boundary, is this configuration physically possible? Yes, it is. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, and z can also reach inside x to touch y at y's boundary. There's no contradiction here.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Actually, I'm not sure I'm considering all the possibilities correctly. Let me go back to basics.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Let's call the boundary of y as ∂y and the boundary of x as ∂x.

Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, ∂y is contained entirely inside x (and doesn't touch ∂x).

Since y and z touch at their boundaries, there's a point or points on ∂y that are also on ∂z. Let's call such a point p.

So, p is on ∂y and p is on ∂z. Since p is on ∂y, p is inside x. This means z has at least one point (p) inside x.

Now, z can extend beyond the boundary of x, or it can be entirely inside x.

If z extends beyond the boundary of x, then x and z partially overlap (PO). This is one possibility.

If z is entirely inside x, then z can either touch the boundary of x or not:
- If z touches the boundary of x, then TPP(z,x), which means TPPi(x,z).
- If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPP(z,x), which means NTPPi(x,z).

But there's a complication. If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, how can it be externally connected to y, which is also inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x? This seems contradictory, so NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Actually, let me test whether TPPi(x,z) is possible with a more formal check. 

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.
- TPPi(x,z) means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Is there any logical contradiction in these three statements? Let's see:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. The boundary of y is also inside x.

2. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. So, z must have at least some points on the boundary of y, which is inside x.

3. TPPi(x,z) means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. 

Given these, z is entirely inside x, touches the boundary of x, and also touches the boundary of y, which is inside x. This configuration is physically possible.

So, yes, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Actually, I need to ensure I'm interpreting the relations correctly:
TPPi(x, z) means TPP(z, x), which means z is a tangential proper part of x. That means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- Let me check again whether TPP(z,x) is possible given the constraints.

If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary, it can still have parts that touch y's boundary (which is inside x). So, TPP(z,x) doesn't contradict the given conditions.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Actually, let me test one more possibility: EC(x,z).

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

We've established that z has at least one point inside x, where it touches the boundary of y. So, z and x share interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

To summarize again, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Let me think again to make sure I'm not overlooking anything.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

From these, we've established that z has at least one point inside x, where it touches the boundary of y.

If z has parts outside of x, then x and z partially overlap (PO).

If z is entirely inside x, it can either touch the boundary of x or not. If it touches the boundary of x, then TPP(z,x), which means TPPi(x,z). If it doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPP(z,x), which means NTPPi(x,z).

But there's a subtle issue with NTPP(z,x). If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y is also entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, can z and y be externally connected? I've been saying no, but let me double-check.

External connection means two regions touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. So, the boundaries of y and z must have at least one common point, but the interiors of y and z must be disjoint.

Now, if both y and z are non-tangential proper parts of x, they're both inside x and don't touch the boundary of x. Their boundaries are also inside x. It's still possible for the boundaries of y and z to touch, making them externally connected.

So, NTPPi(x,z) (which means NTPP(z,x)) is also a possible relation.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of the TPP and NTPP relations.

TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is a proper part of x (it's entirely inside x) and it touches the boundary of x.

NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is a proper part of x (it's entirely inside x) and it doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Given these definitions, let's double-check:

If z is entirely inside x and touches the boundary of x (TPP(z,x)), it can still have parts that touch the boundary of y (which is inside x). So, TPP(z,x) (or TPPi(x,z)) is possible.

If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x (NTPP(z,x)), it can still have parts that touch the boundary of y (which is also inside x). So, NTPP(z,x) (or NTPPi(x,z)) is also possible.

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(z,x) carefully. I have NTPPi(x,y), which means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Also, I have EC(y,z), which means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Given these, z must touch the boundary of y, which is inside x. 

Now, if z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x (NTPP(z,x)), then z's boundary is inside x. So, z's boundary can touch y's boundary, and both are inside x.

So, NTPP(z,x) (or NTPPi(x,z)) is possible.

Actually, let me test the possibilities in a different way.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. This means they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Let me check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because if y is inside x and z touches y, then z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This means they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. But since y is inside x and z touches y, z must have at least one point inside x. So, x and z share some interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means they share some interior parts, but each has parts that the other doesn't. This is possible. z can have parts inside x (where it touches y) and parts outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. For the same reason as TPP(x,z), this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. z can be inside x, touch x's boundary, and also touch y, which is inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also possible. z can be inside x, not touch x's boundary, and still touch y, which is also inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means they are the same region. But if x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y is also inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

OK, let me just make one final check. After thinking about it, I want to clarify the implications of EC(y,z).

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. This implies that y and z are separate regions that touch at their boundaries.

Now, let's consider the relation NTPP(z,x), which means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. 

If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, can it be externally connected to y, which is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary? Yes, it can. Both y and z can be inside x, not touch x's boundary, and still touch each other at their boundaries.

So, NTPP(z,x) (or NTPPi(x,z)) is possible.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Actually, there's one more sanity check I should run. Let's determine whether z is inside or outside of x.

We have:
- y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)).
- y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts (EC(y,z)).

Given these conditions, z touches the boundary of y, which is inside x. This means z has at least one point inside x. But z doesn't have to be entirely inside x; it can have parts outside of x.

So, z can be:
- Partially inside x and partially outside x, resulting in PO(x,z).
- Completely inside x and touching x's boundary, resulting in TPP(z,x) (or TPPi(x,z)).
- Completely inside x and not touching x's boundary, resulting in NTPP(z,x) (or NTPPi(x,z)).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

This is what I've derived twice now, so it's probably correct.

Actually, I had previously thought that TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) were not possible because I thought it would mean y would be inside z, which would contradict EC(y,z). But I was wrong. Being inside means being a proper part, so if x is inside z, it doesn't mean y is inside z; it just means x is a proper part of z. 

So, let me test TPP(x,z) again. TPP(x,z) means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. 

We're given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)). So, y is a proper part of x. 

We're also given that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts (EC(y,z)).

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary (TPP(x,z)), then x is a proper part of z. Since y is a proper part of x, y is also a proper part of z. 

But this contradicts EC(y,z), which states that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. If y is a proper part of z, they share interior parts.

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I'm now confident in my analysis. The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Actually, I just realized a more direct way to see that TPP(x,z) is not possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), then x is inside z. But if y is inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), then y is inside z. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior parts.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible because it also implies y is inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

I'm convinced that the correct answer is:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

OK, let me try to derive these results one more time:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x). So y is inside x, and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Let's think about what these tell us about the relationship between x and z.

Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and z touches y at their boundaries, z has at least one point inside x. But z doesn't have to be entirely inside x; it can have parts outside of x.

Let's go through each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Disconnected. This means x and z don't touch at all. This is not possible because z touches y, which is inside x, so z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z): Externally connected. This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. But since z touches y, which is inside x, z must have at least one point inside x. So x and z must share some interior points, which contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping. This means x and z share some interior parts, but each has parts that the other doesn't. This is possible. z can have parts inside x (where it touches y) and parts outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. For the same reason as TPP(x,z), this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. z can be inside x, touch x's boundary, and also touch y, which is inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also possible. z can be inside x, not touch x's boundary, and still touch y, which is also inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This means they are the same region. But if x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y is also inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to analyze what happens when y is properly inside x (NTPPi) and z externally connects to y (EC).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary
- EC(y,z): z touches y at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap

First, let me analyze what this tells us about z's position relative to x:
- Since z touches y's boundary, and y is completely inside x, z must have at least one point inside x
- However, z doesn't need to be completely contained within x

Let me check each possible relationship:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible - z touches y which is inside x, so z must at least touch x.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible - since z touches y's boundary (which is strictly inside x), z must have points in x's interior, not just at x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - z can have some parts inside x (where it touches y) and other parts outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible - if x were inside z, then y would also be inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - same reasoning as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be completely inside x while touching x's boundary, and still touch y's boundary inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and still touch y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x and z were identical, y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).
