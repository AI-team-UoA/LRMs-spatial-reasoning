PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what these relations mean:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a part of x but does not touch x's boundary. Equivalently, NTPP(y,x).
2. PO(y,z) means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Now I need to think about what the possible relationships between x and z could be.

Given NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is a proper part of x, and y is completely within the interior of x (not touching x's boundary).
Given PO(y,z), we know that y and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial part.

Let's consider each of the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? Since y is part of x and y shares a part with z, then x must share at least that part with z (through y). So x and z cannot be disconnected. DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Is this possible? Since y is in the interior of x (not touching x's boundary) and y shares parts with z, then z must share interior points with x (through y). So x and z cannot merely touch at boundaries. EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Is this possible? Yes, z could share some parts with y (and thus with x) but also have parts outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? It seems unlikely because y is a proper part of x, and y partially overlaps with z, but doesn't contain z. So x can't be contained in z. TPP is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is even less possible than TPP for the same reasons. NTPP is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, z could be completely within x and touch x's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, z could be completely within the interior of x, while still partially overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. Is this possible? It doesn't seem likely, because y partially overlaps with z, but y is a proper part of x, so z and x can't be identical. EQ is not possible.

Actually, let me reconsider some of my reasoning. I think I made some errors:

For TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), I reasoned that these aren't possible because y is a proper part of x, and y partially overlaps with z, but doesn't contain z. However, this reasoning isn't rigorous enough. Let me reconsider these cases.

For TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? We know y is a proper part of x and y partially overlaps with z. It's possible that x is small enough to be contained within z, with some part of x touching z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, it's possible that x is small enough to be contained entirely within the interior of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Let me revise the consideration for EQ(x,z) as well. EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are identical. Given that y is a proper part of x and y partially overlaps with z, z cannot be identical to x because y can't both be a proper part of z and partially overlap with z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, no, I'm making a mistake again. Let me reconsider EQ(x,z). If x and z are identical, then the fact that y is a proper part of x means y is also a proper part of z. But we're given that PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap. These are contradictory: y can't both be a proper part of z and partially overlap with z. So EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

I think I need to be more methodical. Let's recall the definitions:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and y does not touch x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but not all.

Now let's systematically go through the possibilities for the relation between x and z.

First, what we know is that y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y shares some parts with z but not all of y is in z and not all of z is in y.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is a part of x and y shares a part with z, x and z must share at least that part. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch only at their boundaries. But since y is in the interior of x and y shares a part with z, x and z must share some interior points. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Given what we know, this is possible. Some part of z could overlap with y (and thus with x), while other parts of z could be outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Is this possible? Given that y is a proper part of x and PO(y,z), it's not immediately clear if this is possible. Let's think...

   If x is a proper part of z, then everything in x is also in z. Since y is in x, y is also in z. But we're given that PO(y,z), which means y and z share some parts but not all - specifically, some parts of y are outside of z. This contradicts the assumption that x (and therefore y) is contained in z. So TPP(x,z) is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): By similar reasoning to TPP, if x is a proper part of z, then y (which is a proper part of x) would also be a proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. z could be completely within x and touch x's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is also possible. z could be completely within the interior of x, while still partially overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. If x and z are identical, and y is a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I think I've been making a reasoning error. Let me reconsider:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z) means y and z share some parts but not all; specifically, there are parts of y not in z and parts of z not in y.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they share no parts. But y is a part of x and shares parts with z. So x and z must share at least those parts of y that are in z. This contradicts DC(x,z), so it's not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z only touch at their boundaries, they don't share any interior points. But y is in the interior of x and shares parts with z. So x and z must share interior points (specifically, the parts of y that are also in z). This contradicts EC(x,z), so it's not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible. z could share some parts with y (and thus with x) but also have parts outside of x, and x could have parts outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. 
   Let's think: If x is a proper part of z, then y, which is a proper part of x, is also a proper part of z. But we're given that PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap, with parts of y outside z. This contradicts y being a proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. By the same reasoning as for TPP, this contradicts PO(y,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. 
   Let's think: If z is a proper part of x, then all of z is in x. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some parts, and y is a proper part of x. This scenario is consistent with what we know. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. 
   Similar to TPPi, if z is a proper part of x, then all of z is in x. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some parts, and y is in the interior of x (not touching x's boundary). It's possible for z to also be entirely in the interior of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. 
   If x and z are identical, then y, which is a proper part of x, would also be a proper part of z. But we're given that PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap, with parts of y outside z and parts of z outside y. This contradicts y being a proper part of z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check one of my conclusions. I said that TPP(x,z) is not possible. But to be thorough, let me check if there is any configuration where y is a proper part of x (not touching x's boundary), y and z partially overlap, and x is a proper part of z (touching z's boundary).

If x is a proper part of z, then all of x is in z. Since y is in x, all of y is also in z. But then y would be a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if x is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

So the conclusion remains the same. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check EQ(x,z) as well. If x and z are identical, then y, which is a proper part of x, would also be a proper part of z. But we're given that PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap. Since y can't both be a proper part of z and partially overlapping with z, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the final list of possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me check if there are any other possibilities I might have missed:

DC(x,z): Not possible, as discussed.
EC(x,z): Not possible, as discussed.
PO(x,z): Possible, as discussed.
TPP(x,z): Not possible, as discussed.
NTPP(x,z): Not possible, as discussed.
TPPi(x,z): Possible, as discussed.
NTPPi(x,z): Possible, as discussed.
EQ(x,z): Not possible, as discussed.

So the final answer is:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me recheck my reasoning for PO(x,z). I need to ensure that this is consistent with what we know: NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some parts but not all. Given NTPPi(x,y), y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some parts but not all.

So, z definitely shares parts with y (which is a part of x), which means z shares parts with x as well. But does z share all parts with x? Not necessarily. z could have parts outside of y, and some of those parts could be outside of x as well. Similarly, x definitely includes all of y, but y doesn't include all of z (since PO(y,z)), so x doesn't necessarily include all of z.

Thus, PO(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship between x and z.

I think the final set of possible relationships between x and z is:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let's understand what we know:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- PO(y,z): y and z share some parts but not all (neither contains the other)

Now I'll analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - impossible because y is part of x and y shares parts with z, so x and z must share parts

2. EC(x,z) - impossible because y is in the interior of x and y shares parts with z, so x and z must share interior points, not just boundaries

3. PO(x,z) - possible: z can share some parts with y (thus with x) while having parts outside x, and x can have parts not in z

4. TPP(x,z) - impossible: if x were contained in z, then y (which is a part of x) would be a proper part of z, contradicting PO(y,z)

5. NTPP(x,z) - impossible: for the same reason as TPP

6. TPPi(x,z) - possible: z can be completely contained in x while touching x's boundary, and still partially overlap with y

7. NTPPi(x,z) - possible: z can be completely contained in x's interior without touching x's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y

8. EQ(x,z) - impossible: if x and z were identical, then y would be a proper part of z, contradicting PO(y,z)

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
