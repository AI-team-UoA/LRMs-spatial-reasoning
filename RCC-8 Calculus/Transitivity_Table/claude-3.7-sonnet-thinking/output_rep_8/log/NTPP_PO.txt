PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this carefully using the definitions and properties of RCC-8 relations.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is entirely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y partially overlaps z, meaning y and z share some parts but neither is fully contained in the other.

Let's consider what these conditions mean for the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. Since PO(y,z), y and z overlap partially.

Let's analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   If y and z only overlap in a region that doesn't include x, then x and z could be disconnected.
   So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z externally connect?
   For this to be true, x would have to touch z's boundary. Since x is NTPP to y, x doesn't touch y's boundary.
   If z's boundary passes through the interior of y and touches x, then EC(x,z) could be possible.
   However, since x is NTPP to y, it doesn't touch y's boundary, and if z's boundary intersects with x, that would mean x and z share parts.
   So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   If z overlaps partially with y in a way that also partially includes x, then x and z would partially overlap.
   So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   For this to be true, x would need to be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary.
   Since x is NTPP to y, it doesn't touch y's boundary.
   If z contains x completely and z's boundary passes through y in a way that touches x, then TPP(x,z) would be possible.
   But since x is NTPP to y, it doesn't touch y's boundary, and if z's boundary touches x, it would mean x is not tangential to z.
   So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to reconsider TPP(x,z). Let me be more precise.

For TPP(x,z), x needs to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since x is NTPP to y, x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So x cannot touch any part of z's boundary that is outside of y. 

But what about the parts of z's boundary that are inside y? If z's boundary cuts through y in a way that touches x, then TPP(x,z) could be possible.

Let me reconsider more carefully. 

If x is NTPP to y, then x is completely contained in the interior of y. 
If y and z partially overlap (PO), then z could contain parts of y, including potentially all of x.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely contained in z and x must touch the boundary of z.
Since x is NTPP to y, x is completely contained in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

If z's boundary passes through the interior of y and touches x, then x would touch z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) possible.

So actually, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   For this to be true, x would need to be completely contained in the interior of z.
   If z contains a region of y that fully encompasses x and more, then NTPP(x,z) could be possible.
   So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely contained in x and touch x's boundary.
   Since PO(y,z), z cannot be completely contained in y (and thus cannot be completely contained in x, since x is contained in y).
   So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely contained in the interior of x.
   Since PO(y,z), z cannot be completely contained in y (and thus cannot be completely contained in x).
   So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   For this to be true, x and z would need to be the same region.
   Since NTPP(x,y), x is properly contained in y.
   Since PO(y,z), z is not completely contained in y.
   So x and z cannot be equal, and EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But wait, let me check more carefully...

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary. Since x is NTPP to y, it doesn't touch y's boundary. If z's boundary passes through the interior of y and touches x, then TPP(x,z) would be possible.

Let me think again about TPP(x,z) more carefully.

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. PO(y,z) means y and z overlap partially.

For TPP(x,z) to be true:
- x must be completely contained in z
- x must touch z's boundary

Since x is NTPP to y, x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. 

If z overlaps with y such that z contains all of x and z's boundary passes through the interior of y touching x, then TPP(x,z) would be possible.

So I think TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me summarize the possible relationships between x and z based on NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z):

1. DC(x,z): Possible if z overlaps with parts of y that don't include x.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible, because x is in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
3. PO(x,z): Possible if z partially overlaps with x.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible if z contains all of x and z's boundary passes through y touching x.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if z contains all of x and there's a "buffer" between x and z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible, because z cannot be contained in x due to PO(y,z).
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible, for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible, because z cannot be equal to x due to their relationships with y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think once more about EC(x,z).

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to touch at their boundaries but not share interior points.

Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
Since PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points.

Now, could z's boundary pass through the interior of y and touch x without z's interior overlapping with x? 

No, that's not possible. If z's boundary touches x, then there must be points of z arbitrarily close to x on both sides of the boundary. Since x is a region with an interior, some of those points would have to be in the interior of x, meaning x and z would overlap, not just externally connect.

So EC(x,z) is not possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, actually let me reconsider EC(x,z) once more.

EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

For EC(x,z) to be true:
1. x and z must touch at their boundaries.
2. x and z must not share any interior points.

Since x is NTPP to y, x is completely in the interior of y. This means that any point on the boundary of x is in the interior of y.

For EC(x,z) to be true, z's boundary would need to pass through the interior of y and touch x's boundary without z's interior overlapping with x's interior.

Actually, here is what I now think: Even if z's boundary touches x's boundary, since z has an interior and x is a region, there would be points of z's interior arbitrarily close to z's boundary. Since x also has interior points arbitrarily close to its boundary, some interior points of z would overlap with interior points of x if their boundaries touch.

So I don't think EC(x,z) is possible given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Alright, I think the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to be careful. Let me double-check this reasoning.

Let's once again think through the case where z's boundary passes through the interior of y and touches x's boundary.

Since x is NTPP to y, x is completely in the interior of y.
Since PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points.

If z's boundary touches x's boundary at a point p, then:
1. p is in the interior of y (since x is NTPP to y)
2. p is on the boundary of x
3. p is on the boundary of z

Now, in the neighborhood of p, there are interior points of x (since p is on x's boundary). There are also interior points of z (since p is on z's boundary).

Given that both x and z are regions with interiors, and their boundaries touch at p, some interior points of x and some interior points of z will be arbitrarily close to p. This means that there will be some overlap between the interiors of x and z.

So if z's boundary touches x's boundary, then x and z will share interior points, which means they will partially overlap (PO), not externally connect (EC).

So I still believe that EC(x,z) is not possible given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

The possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, actually I'm not sure I've thought about TPP(x,z) correctly.

For TPP(x,z) to be true:
1. x must be a proper part of z (i.e., x is completely contained in z and x is not equal to z)
2. x must touch z's boundary

Since x is NTPP to y, x is completely in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

If z overlaps with y in such a way that z contains all of x and z's boundary passes through the interior of y touching x, then TPP(x,z) would be possible.

This seems consistent with the constraints, so TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

So I think the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me just double-check TPP(x,z) again. I want to make sure my reasoning is correct.

For TPP(x,z) to be true:
1. x must be a proper part of z (i.e., x is completely contained in z and x is not equal to z)
2. x must touch z's boundary

Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, z would need to contain all of x, and z's boundary would need to intersect with x. 

Given that x is NTPP to y and PO(y,z), is it possible for z to contain all of x and for z's boundary to intersect with x?

Yes, if z overlaps with y in such a way that z contains all of x, and z's boundary passes through the interior of y and touches x, then TPP(x,z) would be possible.

So I still believe that TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), I need to analyze each potential RCC-8 relation:

1) NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary
2) PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, sharing some common region

For each possible relation between x and z:

- DC(x,z): Possible if z overlaps with y in areas that don't include x
- EC(x,z): Not possible because x is entirely in y's interior and can't externally connect with z
- PO(x,z): Possible if z partially covers x
- TPP(x,z): Possible if z contains all of x and z's boundary passes through y in a way that touches x
- NTPP(x,z): Possible if z completely contains x with buffer space between x and z's boundary
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible since z cannot be contained within x (as z extends beyond y)
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because z must extend beyond x due to PO(y,z)

### Answer: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
