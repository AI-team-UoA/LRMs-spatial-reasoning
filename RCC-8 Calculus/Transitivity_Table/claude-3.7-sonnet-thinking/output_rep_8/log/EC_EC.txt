PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

This is a classic composition problem in the RCC-8 calculus. I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between regions x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's recall what EC means:
- EC(x,y) means that x and y are externally connected - they touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
- EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected in the same way.

Now I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z. Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: 
This is definitely possible. Imagine x and z as two regions that are far apart, with y touching both of them at their boundaries but in different places.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
This is possible. Imagine x, y, and z arranged in a way that they all touch at a common boundary point or line.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
This is possible. Imagine y as a thin strip that touches both x and z, while x and z overlap with each other.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
This is possible. Imagine x is contained within z and touches z's boundary, while y touches both x and z at their boundaries.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
This is NOT possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y cannot be externally connected to both x and z simultaneously.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential proper part inverse:
This is possible. Imagine z is contained within x and touches x's boundary, while y touches both x and z at their boundaries.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part inverse:
This is NOT possible. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y cannot be externally connected to both x and z simultaneously.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
This is possible. Imagine x and z are the same region, and y touches their common boundary.

So the possible relations are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Let me double check this by reasoning through some specific spatial configurations:

- DC(x,z): Imagine y as a "bridge" that touches x at one end and z at the other, but x and z are separated.
- EC(x,z): Imagine x, y, and z meeting at a point, like three pieces of a pie.
- PO(x,z): Imagine x and z overlapping, with y touching both of them at their boundaries.
- TPP(x,z): Imagine x inside z, touching z's boundary, and y touching x at that same boundary point.
- TPPi(x,z): The inverse of the above situation.
- EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, y can touch their common boundary.

But wait, I need to reconsider NTPP and NTPPi more carefully. 

For NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z (without touching z's boundary), and EC(x,y), then y must touch x's boundary. But since x is completely inside z, y must also be at least partially inside z. But then it's not clear if EC(y,z) can still hold, since y would need to touch z's boundary without overlapping z's interior.

Actually, I think NTPP is impossible in this scenario. If x is completely inside z, then for y to be externally connected to both, y would need to reach from x's boundary to z's boundary without overlapping z's interior, which violates the connectedness of regions.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) would be impossible.

Let me finalize the answer:
The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me triple check this with some visual reasoning:

For DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, and y touches both at their boundaries. Definitely possible.

For EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries, and y also touches both at their boundaries (possibly at the same point where they touch). Definitely possible.

For PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, and y touches both at their boundaries. Definitely possible.

For TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. For y to be externally connected to both, y must touch the boundary of x where it also touches the boundary of z. Definitely possible.

For TPPi(x,z): The inverse situation of the above. Definitely possible.

For EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region, and y touches their boundary. Definitely possible.

For NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. For y to be externally connected to x, y must touch x's boundary. But then, for y to be externally connected to z, y must also touch z's boundary without overlapping z's interior. This is impossible if x is completely inside z.

For NTPPi(x,z): The inverse situation of NTPP, which is also impossible.

So my answer remains: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP once more. If x is completely inside z, and y touches x's boundary, does y necessarily have to overlap with z's interior?

Yes, it does. Since x is completely inside z (NTPP), any region that touches x's boundary must overlap with z's interior. Therefore, y cannot be externally connected to z; it would either overlap with z (making it PO(y,z)) or be completely inside z (making it TPP(y,z) or NTPP(y,z)). So NTPP(x,z) is indeed impossible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

By the same logic, NTPPi(x,z) is also impossible.

So my final answer is: The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me check if this answer is supported by the composition table for RCC-8. Tha standard composition table gives us that the composition of EC with EC is:

EC ∘ EC = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}

But wait, this suggests that NTPP and NTPPi are possible results of the composition. Let me reconsider my reasoning...

I think I made an error in my spatial reasoning. Let me think about NTPP(x,z) again:

If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary. 
If EC(x,y), then y touches x's boundary.
If EC(y,z), then y touches z's boundary.

The question is: Can y both touch x's boundary and z's boundary if x is completely inside z?

Let me think of a concrete example: Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle completely inside z, and y as a long, thin shape that touches x's boundary and extends all the way to touch z's boundary without overlapping z's interior. This doesn't seem to violate any topological constraints.

So actually, NTPP(x,z) is possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

By symmetry, NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

Therefore, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are all eight relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I need to be more careful about my reasoning. The key constraint in RCC-8 is that regions are supposed to be connected. Let me reconsider the NTPP example:

If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z.
If EC(x,y), then y touches x's boundary.
If EC(y,z), then y touches z's boundary without overlapping z's interior.

But if y is connected (a single piece), it cannot both touch x's boundary and z's boundary without passing through z's interior. This would require y to be disconnected, which violates the RCC assumption.

Actually, I need to be careful here. The regions in RCC-8 must be internally connected, but they don't need to be "convex" or "simple". So let me consider whether y could be a single connected region that wraps around in a way that it touches both x and z at their boundaries.

I think this is still impossible for NTPP(x,z). If x is completely inside z, then any connected region that touches x's boundary must intersect z's interior. So if y touches x's boundary, it must overlap with z's interior, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So my reasoning was correct initially: NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

The possible relations are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me double check this by consulting the standard RCC-8 composition table. The composition of EC ∘ EC is typically given as {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}, which includes all eight relations.

I need to reconcile this with my reasoning. Let me think more carefully about the NTPP case:

If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
If EC(x,y), then y touches x's boundary but doesn't overlap with x's interior.
If EC(y,z), then y touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z's interior.

Is this combination possible? I need to consider whether y can be a single connected region that touches both x's boundary and z's boundary without overlapping z's interior.

I think this is indeed impossible. If x is completely inside z, then there's a "buffer zone" of z's interior surrounding x. Any connected region that touches x's boundary must pass through this buffer zone, and thus overlap with z's interior. This contradicts EC(y,z).

So I believe my reasoning is correct: NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the constraint EC(y,z). This means y touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z's interior. Now, if x is completely inside z (NTPP), then y cannot touch x's boundary without overlapping with z's interior, which would contradict EC(y,z).

Similarly, if z is completely inside x (NTPPi), then y cannot touch z's boundary without overlapping with x's interior, which would contradict EC(x,y).

So I'm confident that NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

The possible relations are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

I'm unsure why this seems to disagree with the standard RCC-8 composition table, which suggests all eight relations are possible. Let me consider if there's some aspect of the RCC-8 definition that I'm misinterpreting.

Actually, I think I was right in ruling out NTPP and NTPPi. 

If EC(x,y), then y touches x's boundary but doesn't overlap with x's interior.
If EC(y,z), then y touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z's interior.
If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

For y to be externally connected to both x and z, it must touch both of their boundaries. But if x is completely inside z (without touching z's boundary), then for y to touch x's boundary, it must penetrate z's interior, which contradicts EC(y,z).

I believe the standard RCC-8 composition table might be giving the "theoretically possible" relations without considering the specific constraints of the problem. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting something about the RCC-8 definitions.

Let me consult the formal definition of RCC-8 to ensure I'm understanding the constraints correctly.

In RCC-8, the eight base relations are:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points).
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary).
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary).
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.

Now, let's reconsider the NTPP case:
If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
If EC(x,y), then y touches x's boundary but doesn't overlap with x's interior.
If EC(y,z), then y touches z's boundary but doesn't overlap with z's interior.

For y to satisfy both EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), it must touch both x's boundary and z's boundary. But if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then any region that touches x's boundary must overlap with z's interior. This contradicts EC(y,z), which requires y to not overlap with z's interior.

So, my reasoning is consistent with the formal definitions of RCC-8: NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Therefore, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

But I see the standard composition table gives us that the composition of EC with EC is:

EC ∘ EC = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}

This suggests that all eight relations, including NTPP and NTPPi, are possible results of the composition.

Let me consider if there's a configuration that I'm missing, where NTPP(x,z) is consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
For EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x's boundary without overlapping with x's interior.
For EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z's boundary without overlapping with z's interior.

The key constraint is: Can y both touch x's boundary and z's boundary if x is completely inside z? I don't think this is possible if y is a single connected region.

But actually, there's a crucial point I'm missing: the RCC-8 framework doesn't require regions to be connected. So y could be a disconnected region with one part touching x's boundary and another part touching z's boundary.

Actually, wait, let me clarify: The regions in RCC-8 are assumed to be "regular closed sets," which are internally connected. So y should be a single connected region.

But the RCC (Region Connection Calculus) is founded on a binary primitive relation C(x, y), which means "x connects with y". This relation is reflexive and symmetric. All the other RCC-8 relations are defined in terms of this primitive.

So, the question becomes: Is it possible for a connected region y to both connect with the boundary of x and the boundary of z, without overlapping with z's interior, if x is completely inside z?

Let me try a concrete example: Imagine a doughnut-shaped region y, where the hole of the doughnut contains x, and the outer rim of the doughnut touches z's boundary. This way, y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, without overlapping with z's interior. But this would make y disconnected, which is not allowed in RCC-8.

I'm still convinced that NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Therefore, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me examine one of the standard RCC-8 composition tables to see if it agrees:

For RCC-8, the composition of EC with EC includes:
- DC: Disconnected
- EC: Externally connected
- PO: Partially overlapping
- TPP: Tangential proper part
- NTPP: Non-tangential proper part
- TPPi: Tangential proper part inverse
- NTPPi: Non-tangential proper part inverse
- EQ: Equal

This suggests that all eight relations are possible.

Let me re-examine my reasoning one more time, particularly for the NTPP case:

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
For EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x's boundary without overlapping with x's interior.
For EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z's boundary without overlapping with z's interior.

The key question is: Is there a topological configuration where all three of these conditions can be satisfied simultaneously?

Let's think of it this way: If x is completely inside z, there's a "buffer zone" of z's interior surrounding x. For y to connect to both x's boundary and z's boundary, it must cross this buffer zone. But doing so would mean y overlaps with z's interior, which contradicts EC(y,z).

However, I'm overlooking something important: the "connection" in RCC-8 doesn't necessarily mean a direct path. It's a more abstract notion of topological connection.

In fact, in certain topological interpretations of RCC-8, regions can be "connected" in ways that might not align with our intuitive understanding. For instance, regions can be connected through "external contact" without sharing interior points.

So, it's possible that in some interpretations of RCC-8, there might be configurations where NTPP(x,z) is consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). However, based on the usual understanding of these relations in spatial reasoning, I believe that NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Actually, let me reconsider once more. I think I might be missing a mathematical proof. 

Let's just define the standard RCC-8 relations in first-order logic:

DC(x,y) ≡ ¬C(x,y)
EC(x,y) ≡ C(x,y) ∧ ¬O(x,y)
PO(x,y) ≡ O(x,y) ∧ ¬P(x,y) ∧ ¬P(y,x)
TPP(x,y) ≡ P(x,y) ∧ ¬P(y,x) ∧ ∃z[EC(z,x) ∧ EC(z,y)]
NTPP(x,y) ≡ P(x,y) ∧ ¬P(y,x) ∧ ¬∃z[EC(z,x) ∧ EC(z,y)]
TPPi(x,y) ≡ TPP(y,x)
NTPPi(x,y) ≡ NTPP(y,x)
EQ(x,y) ≡ P(x,y) ∧ P(y,x)

Where O(x,y) means that x and y overlap (share a common part), and P(x,y) means that x is a part of y.

So NTPP(x,z) means:
1. P(x,z) (x is a part of z)
2. ¬P(z,x) (z is not a part of x)
3. ¬∃w[EC(w,x) ∧ EC(w,z)] (there's no region w that is externally connected to both x and z)

But we're considering the case where:
- EC(x,y) (x and y are externally connected)
- EC(y,z) (y and z are externally connected)

This immediately contradicts condition 3 of NTPP(x,z), because y is a region that's externally connected to both x and z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is definitely not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z). And by symmetry, NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

Therefore, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I now realize my error. I've been confusing myself about the RCC-8 composition table. The composition table tells us which relations are possible between x and z given some relation between x and y, and some relation between y and z. It's not saying that all eight relations are always possible for every specific relation between x, y, and z.

Given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are a subset of the full RCC-8 set, and as I've demonstrated, this subset includes DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ, but not NTPP or NTPPi.

In fact, the composition table should say exactly this. If it doesn't, then the table is incorrect. I'm confident in my reasoning because the definition of NTPP specifically excludes the possibility of a region being externally connected to both x and z, which is exactly what we have with y.

Therefore, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me double check the definition again:

NTPP(x,y) ≡ P(x,y) ∧ ¬P(y,x) ∧ ¬∃z[EC(z,x) ∧ EC(z,y)]

Given this, if NTPP(x,z), then:
1. P(x,z) (x is a part of z)
2. ¬P(z,x) (z is not a part of x)
3. ¬∃w[EC(w,x) ∧ EC(w,z)] (there's no region w that is externally connected to both x and z)

But we have EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), so y is a region that's externally connected to both x and z. This directly contradicts condition 3 of NTPP(x,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), which is defined as NTPP(z,x), we would need:
1. P(z,x) (z is a part of x)
2. ¬P(x,z) (x is not a part of z)
3. ¬∃w[EC(w,z) ∧ EC(w,x)] (there's no region w that is externally connected to both z and x)

Again, y is a region that's externally connected to both z and x, contradicting condition 3 of NTPPi(x,z).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Therefore, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I just realized I've been making a fundamental mistake. Let me check the definition of NTPP again.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y.

In RCC-8, this is typically defined as:
NTPP(x,y) ≡ P(x,y) ∧ ¬∃z[EC(z,x) ∧ EC(z,y)]

This means:
1. x is a part of y.
2. There is no region z that is externally connected to both x and y.

The second condition is often interpreted as "x does not touch y's boundary" or "x is completely inside y."

Now, if NTPP(x,z), this means:
1. x is a part of z.
2. There is no region w that is externally connected to both x and z.

But we have EC(y,x) and EC(y,z), so y is a region that's externally connected to both x and z. This contradicts condition 2 of NTPP(x,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible either.

Therefore, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Okay, I think I've been overthinking this. The definition of NTPP in RCC-8 directly contradicts the scenario where there's a region (y in this case) that's externally connected to both x and z. So, NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

I am confident in my assessment:

The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me do one final sanity check.

The definition of NTPP in RCC-8 is:
NTPP(x,y) ≡ P(x,y) ∧ ¬∃z[EC(z,x) ∧ EC(z,y)]

This says that x is a non-tangential proper part of y if and only if:
1. x is a part of y.
2. There is no region z that is externally connected to both x and y.

The second condition ensures that x doesn't touch y's boundary, making it a "non-tangential" part.

Now, given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), can NTPP(x,z) hold? 

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, there should be no region that is externally connected to both x and z. But y is externally connected to both x and z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) cannot hold.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to hold, there should be no region that is externally connected to both z and x. But y is externally connected to both z and x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) cannot hold.

This confirms my previous conclusion: 

The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I believe I've now addressed this problem comprehensively. The key insight is that the definition of NTPP in RCC-8 explicitly excludes the possibility of there being a region that's externally connected to both x and z, which is exactly what we have with y in this scenario.

Therefore, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Imagine y as a "bridge" that touches x at one boundary point and z at another boundary point, while x and z are completely separated.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries, with y also touching both at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y touching both at their respective boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z, with y touching both at the point where x touches z's boundary.

5. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x, with y touching both at the point where z touches x's boundary.

6. EQ(x,z): Possible. x and z can be identical, with y touching their common boundary.

7. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then any region y that is externally connected to x would have to overlap with z's interior, contradicting EC(y,z).

8. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. By the same reasoning as above, in reverse.
