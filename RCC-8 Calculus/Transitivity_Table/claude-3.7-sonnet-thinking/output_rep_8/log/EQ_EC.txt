PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to figure out the possible relationship between x and z given that EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's analyze what these conditions mean:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are spatially coincident. That is, they occupy exactly the same space.
- EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), they have the same boundaries and interior parts. Since y and z touch at their boundaries (EC(y,z)), this means that x and z must also touch at their boundaries but not share interior parts.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be EC(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- x and y are exactly the same region (EQ(x,y))
- y and z touch at boundaries only (EC(y,z))
- Since x is exactly the same region as y, x must have the same relationship with z as y does
- Therefore, x and z must touch at boundaries only (EC(x,z))

So the answer is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

Given the information:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts

Since x and y are spatially identical (EQ(x,y)), x must have exactly the same relationship with z as y does with z. 

Since y and z are in the EC relation (externally connected), then x and z must also be externally connected.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
