PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

This is asking about RCC8 composition. We need to find out what spatial relations can hold between x and z given that EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's think about the constraints:
- EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected, so they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, so they share some interior parts but neither is fully contained in the other.

Now I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z. Let's reason through the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible because x touches only the boundary of y, and z could be positioned such that it overlaps with y in a region that doesn't include the area where x touches y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect. This is possible if z extends to the boundary of y where x touches y.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This seems unlikely given that x only touches the boundary of y and doesn't share interior points with y. Since z partially overlaps with y (sharing interior points), it's hard to see how x could share interior points with z without sharing interior points with y. However, we need to be careful about the exact definitions here.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z completely contains x and x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible because x touches the boundary of y, so it can't be completely contained in the interior of z if z partially overlaps with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x completely contains z and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x completely contains z and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This seems unlikely because if x and z were equal, and x is externally connected to y, then z would also be externally connected to y, not partially overlapping with y.

Let me double-check my reasoning for each of these:

1. DC(x,z): Yes, this is possible. If x touches y at a boundary point that is far from where z overlaps with y, then x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Yes, this is possible. If z extends to include the boundary point of y where x touches y, then x and z can be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): I need to think more carefully about this. If x touches y at a boundary point, and z overlaps with y but also extends beyond y in a way that includes part of x, then x and z could partially overlap. So this is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If z includes all of x and x touches the boundary of z, then this relation is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This isn't possible because if x touches the boundary of y, and z only partially overlaps with y, then x can't be contained entirely in the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): If x includes all of z and z touches the boundary of x, then this relation is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If x includes all of z and z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then this relation is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This isn't possible because if x = z, then x would have to both externally connect to y and partially overlap with y, which is a contradiction.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider each case more carefully, keeping in mind the definitions of EC and PO:

- EC(x,y): x and y share boundary points but no interior points
- PO(y,z): y and z share some interior points, and neither is contained in the other

1. DC(x,z): Yes, this is possible. If x touches y at a boundary point, and z overlaps with y in a region that doesn't include or extend to that boundary point, then x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Yes, this is possible. If z extends to the boundary of y where x touches y, then x and z can be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): This requires x and z to share interior points. If x only touches the boundary of y and doesn't share interior points with y, and z only shares interior points with y, it's not immediately clear how x and z could share interior points. However, z could extend beyond y and overlap with part of the interior of x, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, z would need to contain all of x, and x would need to touch the boundary of z. This seems possible if z includes all of x and extends beyond it, but still only partially overlaps with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, z would need to contain x entirely in its interior. This doesn't seem compatible with EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) because if x touches the boundary of y, and z only partially overlaps with y, then x can't be entirely in the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, x would need to contain all of z, and z would need to touch the boundary of x. This seems possible if x is much larger than z and z only partially overlaps with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, x would need to contain z entirely in its interior. This seems possible if x is much larger than z and z is contained entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they would have to be the same region. But we know EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), so x and z can't be equal because they relate differently to y.

I think I need to visualize this more carefully.

EC(x,y) means x and y share boundary points but no interior points.
PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relations between x and z?

Let's think step by step again.

If x touches y at a boundary point, and z overlaps with y but also extends beyond y, then x and z could:

1. DC(x,z): Be disconnected (if z doesn't extend to where x touches y)
2. EC(x,z): Touch at a boundary (if z extends exactly to the boundary point where x touches y)
3. PO(x,z): Partially overlap (if z extends into x)
4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z (if z completely contains x and x touches z's boundary)
5. NTPP(x,z): I previously said this isn't possible, but let me reconsider. If z extends well beyond y and completely contains x in its interior, this could be possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x (if x completely contains z and z touches x's boundary)
7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (if x completely contains z and z doesn't touch x's boundary)
8. EQ(x,z): x and z cannot be equal because they relate differently to y

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(x,z). If x touches the boundary of y, and z partially overlaps with y, could x be completely in the interior of z? If z extends well beyond y and completely surrounds x, then it seems like x would have to be in the interior of z. But if x touches the boundary of y, and z only partially overlaps with y, then it's not clear how x could be completely in the interior of z without z completely containing y (which would contradict PO(y,z)).

I think I need to be more precise about the definition of PO(y,z). PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. So z cannot completely contain y.

If EC(x,y), then x touches the boundary of y but doesn't share interior points with y. If PO(y,z), then z shares some interior points with y but doesn't completely contain y.

Given these constraints, could x be completely in the interior of z (NTPP(x,z))? It seems unlikely because if x touches the boundary of y, and z doesn't completely contain y, then x would likely touch the boundary of z as well, or be outside of z entirely.

So I think NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider TPP(x,z). If x touches the boundary of y, and z partially overlaps with y, could x be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary? This seems possible if z extends beyond y in a way that includes all of x, and x touches the boundary of z at the same point where it touches the boundary of y.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), it's not immediately clear how these could be satisfied given the constraints. Let me think about these more carefully.

Actually, let me think about this problem differently. Let's consider the standard RCC8 composition table, which tells us what relations are possible between x and z given the relations between x and y, and y and z.

According to the RCC8 composition table, if EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, that's all of the relations except EQ(x,z). So according to the composition table, any relation except EQ is possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

But let me double-check this by reasoning through a few examples:

1. DC(x,z): x touches the boundary of y, and z overlaps with y in a region that doesn't include or extend to that boundary point. So x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x touches the boundary of y, and z overlaps with y and extends exactly to the boundary point where x touches y. So x and z touch at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x touches the boundary of y, and z overlaps with y and extends into x. So x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x touches the boundary of y, and z completely contains x and extends beyond it, but x touches the boundary of z. This is possible if z is much larger than y and x.

5. NTPP(x,z): x touches the boundary of y, and z completely contains x in its interior. This is possible if z is much larger than y and x, and x is contained entirely in the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): x completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x. This is possible if x is much larger than y and z, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): x completely contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible if x is much larger than y and z, and z is contained entirely in the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This isn't possible because if x = z, then x would have to both externally connect to y and partially overlap with y, which is a contradiction.

So after reasoning through examples, I agree with the composition table that all relations except EQ(x,z) are possible given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, I'm realizing that I need to be more careful about some of these cases. Let me reconsider:

3. PO(x,z): For x and z to partially overlap, they need to share some interior points, but neither can be contained in the other. If x touches y at a boundary point, and z overlaps with y in the interior, it's not immediately clear how x and z could share interior points. However, if z extends beyond y and into x, then x and z could share interior points, so PO(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be completely contained in the interior of z. If x touches the boundary of y, and z partially overlaps with y, it's not clear how x could be completely in the interior of z without z completely containing y (which would contradict PO(y,z)). But if z extends well beyond y and completely surrounds x, then NTPP(x,z) could be possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, x must completely contain z, and z must touch the boundary of x. If z partially overlaps with y and shares interior points with y, and x only touches the boundary of y, it's not clear how x could completely contain z. However, if x is much larger than y and z, and z is positioned so that it touches the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z) could be possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, x must completely contain z, and z must not touch the boundary of x. If z partially overlaps with y and shares interior points with y, and x only touches the boundary of y, it's not clear how x could completely contain z. However, if x is much larger than y and z, and z is positioned entirely in the interior of x, then NTPPi(x,z) could be possible.

I think I'm having trouble visualizing some of these cases because the constraints are somewhat abstract. Let me try to draw some diagrams to help clarify.

Actually, I think I was overthinking this. The RCC8 composition table is a well-established result in qualitative spatial reasoning, and it says that if EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the possible relations between x and z are all RCC8 relations except EQ(x,z). So the answer is:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

That is, all relations except EQ(x,z) are possible.

Let me just make sure I'm confident about a few more of these cases:

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, z must completely contain x, and x must touch the boundary of z. If x touches the boundary of y, and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible for z to extend beyond y in a way that completely contains x, and for x to touch the boundary of z at the same point where it touches the boundary of y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, z must completely contain x in its interior. If x touches the boundary of y, and z partially overlaps with y, z could extend well beyond y in a way that completely surrounds x, placing x entirely in the interior of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, x must completely contain z, and z must touch the boundary of x. If z partially overlaps with y, and x touches the boundary of y, x could be positioned so that it completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x at the point where x touches the boundary of y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, x must completely contain z in its interior. If z partially overlaps with y, and x touches the boundary of y, x could be positioned so that it completely contains z in its interior, away from the point where x touches the boundary of y. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

I'm confident now that all RCC8 relations except EQ(x,z) are possible given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z). The answer is:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), I need to analyze what these constraints allow.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at boundaries but share no interior)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share interior parts but neither is contained in the other)

Possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected if z overlaps with y in an area away from where x touches y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries if z extends to include the boundary point where x touches y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap if z extends beyond y into the interior of x.

4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z if z completely contains x while x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z if z completely contains x in its interior.

6. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x if x completely contains z while z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a non-tangential proper part of x if x completely contains z in its interior.

EQ(x,z) is not possible because x and z would have to relate to y in the same way.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
