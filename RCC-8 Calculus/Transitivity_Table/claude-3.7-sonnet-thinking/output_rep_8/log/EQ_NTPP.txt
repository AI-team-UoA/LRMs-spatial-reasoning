PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason about this step by step.

We have two relationships:
1. EQ(x,y) - which means that x and y are coincident. They occupy the same region.
2. NTPP(y,z) - which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Now we need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same region. Since y is NTPP to z, y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Therefore, x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- If x = y (i.e., EQ(x,y))
- And y is a non-tangential proper part of z (i.e., NTPP(y,z))
- Then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z (i.e., NTPP(x,z))

Yes, this reasoning holds. The answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy the same spatial region)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary)

To find the relation between x and z, I need to understand what happens when we combine these relations.

Since EQ(x,y), x occupies exactly the same region as y.
Since NTPP(y,z), y is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, x must also be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
