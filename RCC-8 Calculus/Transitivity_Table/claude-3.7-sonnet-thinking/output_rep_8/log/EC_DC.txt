PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem step by step. We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

We need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Since EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary. And since DC(y,z), y and z have no connection at all. 

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is disconnected from z, then x can be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   This is also possible. Even though y is disconnected from z, x could touch z at a boundary that doesn't involve y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. x and y touch at a boundary, and y is disconnected from z, but x could still overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. x touches y at a boundary, but could be entirely within z, touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. x could be completely inside z, away from z's boundary, even if x touches y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. z could be entirely within x, touching x's boundary, even if y and z are disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. z could be completely inside x, away from x's boundary, even if y and z are disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This is actually not possible. If x and z were equal, and EC(x,y), then z would also touch y at a boundary, contradicting DC(y,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi.

Wait, I need to double-check some of these. Let me think more carefully.

If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), let's think about the constraints this puts on the relation between x and z.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected, so they don't touch or overlap.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. But if x is a proper part of z, then x's boundary must intersect with z's boundary. Given that x touches y at a boundary, and y is disconnected from z, this suggests that the part of x's boundary that touches y can't be part of z's boundary. This means that for TPP(x,z) to be true, x must touch y at a point that is not on z's boundary. This is possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. If x is completely inside z, then y can't be inside z (since y is disconnected from z). Given that x touches y, this means the part of x that touches y must be at a distance from z's boundary. This is possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. If z is a proper part of x, and y is disconnected from z, then y and z don't share any points. But y touches x at a boundary, which means y touches a part of x that is not z. This is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. If z is completely inside x, away from x's boundary, and y touches x at a boundary, then y and z don't share any points. This is consistent with DC(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be the same region. If x and z are the same, and x touches y, then z must also touch y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi.

Let me re-analyze to be sure:

If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), we know that y touches x but is completely separate from z.

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. X and z can be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. X can touch z at a boundary point, as long as that boundary point is not shared with y.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. X and z can overlap partially, as long as the overlapping region doesn't include the boundary where x touches y.

4. TPP(x,z): This is tricky. For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. At the same time, x touches y, and y is disconnected from z. This means the part of x that touches y can't be touching z's boundary (since y and z are disconnected). But for TPP(x,z) to be true, x must touch z's boundary somewhere. So, TPP(x,z) is possible as long as x touches z's boundary at a point not shared with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. X can be completely inside z, away from z's boundary, and still touch y (which is outside z).

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Since y touches x and is disconnected from z, the part of x's boundary that y touches can't be touching z. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. Z can be completely inside x, away from x's boundary, and x can still touch y (which is disconnected from z).

8. EQ(x,z): As I mentioned before, this is not possible. If x and z are equal, and x touches y, then z must also touch y, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, after re-analyzing, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, I think I need to be careful about all of the cases. Let me go through them more systematically using the constraint that if EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), then y and z have no shared points (they are completely separate), and x and y touch at a boundary (they share boundary points but no interior points).

1. DC(x,z): In this case, x and z have no shared points. This is completely consistent with the given constraints, as x can touch y at a boundary, and y can be separate from z, and x can also be separate from z.

2. EC(x,z): In this case, x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. This is possible as long as the point(s) where x touches z are different from the point(s) where x touches y, which is feasible.

3. PO(x,z): In this case, x and z partially overlap. This is possible as long as the overlapping region of x and z doesn't include the boundary points where x touches y, which is feasible.

4. TPP(x,z): In this case, x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. For this to be consistent with the given constraints, the part of x's boundary that touches y must not be part of z's boundary (since y and z are disconnected). This means x must touch z's boundary at a point other than where x touches y. This is feasible.

5. NTPP(x,z): In this case, x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This seems problematic. If x is completely inside z, away from z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y must intrude into z. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) seems not possible.

Wait, actually let's think about this more carefully. We know that EC(x,y), so x and y touch at a boundary. And DC(y,z), so y and z are disconnected. 

Can NTPP(x,z) be true? If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. But if x is touching y at a boundary, and y is outside of z, then x must touch z's boundary at least at the point(s) where x touches y. This contradicts NTPP(x,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): In this case, z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since y touches x's boundary and is disconnected from z, z must touch x's boundary at a point other than where y touches x. This is feasible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): In this case, z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since y touches x's boundary and is disconnected from z, z must be inside x, away from the point(s) where y touches x. This is feasible.

8. EQ(x,z): In this case, x and z are the same region. If x touches y at a boundary, then z (which is the same as x) must also touch y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after a more systematic analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, NTPPi.

Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning for NTPP(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. If x is completely inside z, away from z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y must extend into z to touch x. But this contradicts DC(y,z).

OK, so let's actually think even more carefully. If EC(x,y), then x and y share some boundary points but no interior points. If DC(y,z), then y and z share no points at all.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary. This means x is completely inside z, with a gap between x's boundary and z's boundary. If y touches x's boundary, and y is outside of z, then y must cross z's boundary to reach x, which means y and z would share some points, contradicting DC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Alright, let's rethink:

If EC(x,y), then x and y share boundary points but no interior points.
If DC(y,z), then y and z share no points at all.

Let's re-analyze the possibilities for the relation between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): x and z share no points. This is consistent with the constraints.

2. EC(x,z): x and z share boundary points but no interior points. This is consistent as long as the shared boundary points between x and z are not also shared with y (since y is disconnected from z).

3. PO(x,z): x and z share interior points, but neither is a proper part of the other. This is consistent as long as the interior points shared by x and z are not also shared with y (which they can't be, since y doesn't share interior points with x).

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is tricky. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is disconnected from z, it seems challenging for x to also be inside z and touch z's boundary. If x touches y at a boundary, that part of x's boundary must be outside of z (or at least, not in z's interior). But if x is a proper part of z, how can it have a boundary point that's not inside z?

Let's think more carefully. If TPP(x,z), then all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is disconnected from z, then the boundary points of x that touch y can't be the same as the boundary points of x that touch z's boundary.

Oh wait, I see the problem. If EC(x,y), the shared boundary points between x and y are, by definition, boundary points of both x and y. If DC(y,z), then y and z share no points. If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

But wait, let me think more carefully about the definition of TPP:

TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is a proper part of z, and x touches z's boundary.

Let me check if there's a geometric configuration that satisfies TPP(x,z), EC(x,y), and DC(y,z).

For TPP(x,z), x must be inside z and touch z's boundary. For EC(x,y), x and y must touch at a boundary. For DC(y,z), y and z must have no common points.

Imagine z as a circle, x as a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary. Now, y could be a circle outside of z, touching x at the same point where x touches z's boundary. But this would mean y and z touch at a boundary, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Actually, hold up. Let's try to be even more precise. Let's imagine this with specific shapes:

- Imagine z as a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2 units.
- Imagine x as a circle centered at (1, 0) with a radius of 1 unit. This way, x is inside z and touches z's boundary at the point (2, 0).
- For EC(x,y), y must touch x at a boundary. But for DC(y,z), y must not touch z.

Hmm, the problem is that if x touches z's boundary, then any point on x's boundary that touches z's boundary can't also touch y (since y doesn't touch z). So, y must touch x at a boundary point that's not the same as where x touches z.

But that doesn't quite work. If x touches z's boundary at point p, then that point p is a boundary point of both x and z. For y to touch x at a boundary, it must touch x at a boundary point, say q. If p and q are the same, then y and z would share a point, contradicting DC(y,z). If p and q are different, then y and z might not share a point, but we're still left with the question of how y can touch x's boundary without intruding into z or sharing a point with z.

Let me rethink this. For TPP(x,z), x is a proper part of z, which means every point of x is a point of z. If x touches y at a boundary, then those shared boundary points of x and y are also points of z. But if those points are points of z, how can y be disconnected from z?

Hmm, I think the definition of TPP is causing the confusion.

Let's be even more precise, using the usual definitions for the RCC relations:

- DC(x,y): x and y have no common points.
- EC(x,y): x and y have common boundary points, but no common interior points.
- PO(x,y): x and y have common interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y, and x has at least one boundary point in common with y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y, and x has no boundary points in common with y.

With these definitions, let's reconsider:

If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper subset of z, and x has at least one boundary point in common with y. If EC(x,y), then x and y have common boundary points, but no common interior points. If DC(y,z), then y and z have no common points.

If x has a boundary point in common with z, and x also has a boundary point in common with y, then z and y might share a point, contradicting DC(y,z). But this is only an issue if x shares the same boundary point with both y and z. If x shares different boundary points with y and z, there's no contradiction.

Let's think of it this way: Imagine a square z, and inside it, a circle x touching one side of the square. Now, outside the square, imagine a smaller circle y touching the circle x at a point away from where x touches z. In this scenario, TPP(x,z), EC(x,y), and DC(y,z) are all satisfied.

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible in conjunction with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

But wait, I think I got confused again. Let's be even clearer:

TPP(x,z) means that every point of x is a point of z, and the boundaries of x and z share at least one point.
EC(x,y) means that the boundaries of x and y share at least one point, but their interiors don't.
DC(y,z) means that y and z don't share any points.

If TPP(x,z), then every point of x is a point of z. If EC(x,y), then x and y share at least one boundary point. Since that boundary point is a point of x, and every point of x is a point of z, that shared boundary point of x and y is also a point of z. But if that point is a point of both y and z, then y and z share a point, contradicting DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) seems to be inconsistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Oh wait, I think I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try again, more carefully.

If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper subset of z, but x's boundary intersects with z's boundary.
If EC(x,y), then x and y share boundary points, but not interior points.
If DC(y,z), then y and z don't share any points.

Let's draw this to try to get a clearer picture.

- Imagine z as a square centered at the origin.
- Imagine x as a circle inside z, touching one side of the square, say at point p. This satisfies TPP(x,z).
- For EC(x,y), y must touch x at a boundary. Let's say y touches x at point q, which is different from p.

Now, is it possible for y to touch x at q without sharing any points with z? If x is a proper subset of z, then every point of x, including its boundary, is a point of z. So, the point q, which is a boundary point of x, is also a point of z. If y touches x at q, then q is also a point of y. But if q is a point of both y and z, then y and z share a point, contradicting DC(y,z).

Wait, I think I see the issue. I've been interpreting "proper subset" in TPP to mean that every point of x, including its boundary, is a point of z. But the standard interpretation in RCC might be that the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, and the boundaries can overlap.

Let me try to think of it geometrically:

TPP(x,z) means that x is a "tangential proper part" of z, which means all of x's interior is inside z's interior, and x's boundary touches z's boundary at some point, but doesn't go outside of z.

Let's see if there's a way to satisfy TPP(x,z), EC(x,y), and DC(y,z):

- Imagine z as a square centered at the origin.
- Imagine x as a circle inside z, touching one side of the square, say at point p. This satisfies TPP(x,z).
- For EC(x,y), y must touch x at a boundary. Let's say y touches x at point q, which is different from p.

But the issue remains: If x's entire boundary is inside or on the boundary of z, and y touches x at a boundary point, then y must enter into z or touch z's boundary, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Wait, I'm confusing myself again. Let's be even more precise and use the standard definitions, which I believe are:

TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, and the boundaries of x and z intersect.
EC(x,y): The boundaries of x and y intersect, but their interiors don't.
DC(y,z): x and y don't share any points, neither boundary nor interior.

So, for TPP(x,z), x is entirely inside z, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of z at some point(s). For EC(x,y), the boundaries of x and y touch at some point(s), but their interiors don't overlap. For DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points, which means y is completely outside of z and doesn't even touch z's boundary.

But if x is entirely inside z (due to TPP(x,z)), and y touches x's boundary (due to EC(x,y)), how can y not touch or overlap with z? It seems the constraints are in conflict.

OK, after thinking about this carefully, I believe that TPP(x,z) is impossible given the constraints EC(x,y) and DC(y,z). 

Let's now consider NTPP(x,z):

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z, and the boundaries of x and z don't intersect. In other words, x is entirely inside z, away from z's boundary.

For EC(x,y) to be true, the boundaries of x and y touch, but their interiors don't overlap.

For DC(y,z) to be true, y and z don't share any points, meaning y is completely outside of z.

But if x is entirely inside z (due to NTPP(x,z)), and y touches x's boundary (due to EC(x,y)), then y would have to intrude into z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is also not possible given the constraints.

But are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) (where z is inside x) possible?

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely inside x, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of x at some point(s).

For EC(x,y) to be true, the boundaries of x and y touch, but their interiors don't overlap.

For DC(y,z) to be true, y and z don't share any points, meaning y is completely outside of z.

This scenario is possible: Imagine x as a large circle. Inside x, place a smaller circle z such that z touches the boundary of x at a point p. Now, outside of x, place another circle y such that y touches the boundary of x at a point q, which is different from p. In this configuration, z and y don't share any points (satisfying DC(y,z)), x and y touch at a boundary (satisfying EC(x,y)), and z is a tangential proper part of x (satisfying TPPi(x,z)).

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely inside x, and the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of x at any point.

This scenario is also possible: Imagine x as a large circle. Inside x, place a smaller circle z such that z is away from the boundary of x. Now, outside of x, place another circle y such that y touches the boundary of x. In this configuration, z and y don't share any points (satisfying DC(y,z)), x and y touch at a boundary (satisfying EC(x,y)), and z is a non-tangential proper part of x (satisfying NTPPi(x,z)).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

So, I've done a thorough analysis, I think the possible RCC8 relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I'm going to take a step back and think from scratch. 

Let's consider the case where we have three regions: x, y, and z.
- EC(x,y): The boundaries of x and y intersect, but their interiors don't.
- DC(y,z): y and z don't share any points, neither boundary nor interior.

The question asks for the possible relations between x and z.

Let's analyze each RCC8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z don't share any points. This is possible. Imagine x and y touching at a boundary, and z completely separate from both.

2. EC(x,z): The boundaries of x and z touch, but their interiors don't. This is possible. Imagine x touching both y and z at different boundary points, with y and z being disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible. Imagine x and z overlapping partially, and y touching x at a boundary away from the overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely inside z, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of z at some point(s). If x is inside z, and y touches x at a boundary, how can y not touch or overlap with z? For y to touch x's boundary, y would have to intrude into z or touch z's boundary. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely inside z, and the boundary of x is away from the boundary of z. If x is inside z, and y touches x at a boundary, how can y not touch or overlap with z? This contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely inside x, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of x at some point(s). This is possible. Imagine z inside x, touching x's boundary at a point, and y touching x's boundary at a different point.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely inside x, and the boundary of z is away from the boundary of x. This is possible. Imagine z inside x, away from x's boundary, and y touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and x touches y at a boundary, then z (which is the same as x) must also touch y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible RCC8 relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, let me just double check my reasoning for TPP(x,z). I initially thought this wasn't possible, but maybe I'm missing something.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be entirely inside z, and the boundary of x must touch the boundary of z at some point(s).
For EC(x,y) to be true, the boundaries of x and y touch, but their interiors don't.
For DC(y,z) to be true, y and z don't share any points, meaning y is completely outside of z and doesn't even touch z's boundary.

If x is inside z (due to TPP(x,z)), and y touches x's boundary (due to EC(x,y)), and y is outside of z (due to DC(y,z)), then the boundary of x must extend outside of z, which contradicts TPP(x,z). So, TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be entirely inside z, away from z's boundary. If y touches x's boundary, and y is outside of z, then the boundary of x must extend outside of z, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

I had initially thought that maybe the boundary of x could "poke" out of z, allowing y to touch it without touching z. But for TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be entirely inside z, which means its boundary can't extend outside of z.

Actually, let me think carefully. In RCC-8, TPP(x,z) means "tangential proper part", which means x is a proper part of z and also touches z's boundary. Let's be sure our definitions are precise.

Actually, I think the definitions we're using are the same. Here's a clarification:

- TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, meaning every point of x is a point of z, and the boundaries of x and z intersect.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z, meaning every point of x is a point of z, and the boundaries of x and z don't intersect.

Now, let's reconsider:

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be entirely inside z, and the boundary of x must touch the boundary of z at some point(s).
For EC(x,y) to be true, the boundaries of x and y touch, but their interiors don't.
For DC(y,z) to be true, y and z don't share any points, meaning y is completely outside of z and doesn't even touch z's boundary.

If x is entirely inside z (due to TPP(x,z)), and y touches x's boundary (due to EC(x,y)), how can y not touch or overlap with z? If y touches x's boundary, and x's boundary is inside or on the boundary of z, then y would have to touch or overlap with z, contradicting DC(y,z).

But let's take a step back. I initially thought that for TPP(x,z), the boundary of x must be entirely inside or on the boundary of z. But this might not be the case. The definition of TPP(x,z) states that x is a proper part of z, meaning every point of x is a point of z, and the boundaries of x and z intersect. It doesn't explicitly state that the boundary of x is entirely inside or on the boundary of z.

Alright, I think this might be where my confusion arises. Let's think of it geometrically:

When we say "x is a proper part of z", it means that the set of points in x is a proper subset of the set of points in z. This means every point of x is a point of z, but not every point of z is a point of x.

If a point is on the boundary of x, it's a point of x. So, if x is a proper part of z, then every point on the boundary of x must also be a point of z. This means the boundary of x must be entirely inside or on the boundary of z.

OK, so TPP(x,z) means that the entirety of x (including its boundary) is inside of z, and at at least one point, the boundary of x touches the boundary of z.

With this understanding, let's reconsider:

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be entirely inside z, and at at least one point, the boundary of x touches the boundary of z.
For EC(x,y) to be true, the boundaries of x and y touch, but their interiors don't.
For DC(y,z) to be true, y and z don't share any points, meaning y is completely outside of z and doesn't even touch z's boundary.

If x is entirely inside z (due to TPP(x,z)), and y touches x's boundary (due to EC(x,y)), how can y not touch or overlap with z? If y touches x's boundary, and x's boundary is inside or on the boundary of z, then y would have to touch or overlap with z, contradicting DC(y,z).

Let me try to draw it out to see if there's a way:

- Imagine z as a circle. Inside z, place another circle x such that the boundary of x touches the boundary of z at a point p. This satisfies TPP(x,z).
- For EC(x,y), y must touch x at a boundary. If y touches x at point p, then y would also touch z, contradicting DC(y,z). If y touches x at a different boundary point q, then that point q is inside z, and for y to touch x at q, y would have to intrude into z, again contradicting DC(y,z).

So, I believe TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible given the constraints.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x is entirely inside z, and the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of z. If y touches x's boundary, and x's boundary is entirely inside z, then y would have to intrude into z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

So, the possible RCC8 relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, let me challenge myself even more. Is it absolutely impossible for TPP(x,z) to be consistent with the constraints?

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be entirely inside z, and at at least one point, the boundary of x touches the boundary of z. Let's call this point of contact p. For EC(x,y) to be true, the boundaries of x and y touch, but their interiors don't. Let's call this point of contact q. For DC(y,z) to be true, y and z don't share any points.

If p and q are the same point, then y would touch z at p, contradicting DC(y,z). If p and q are different points, then the point q, which is on the boundary of x, is inside z. For y to touch x at q, y would have to intrude into z, contradicting DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is inconsistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

OK, let's step back even more.

Tangential proper part means that x is inside z, and at at least one point, the boundary of x touches the boundary of z. Let's say the boundary of x and boundary of z touch at point p. For EC(x,y), the boundaries of x and y touch. For DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points. If y touches the boundary of x, and x is inside z, then y would intrude into z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) doesn't seem compatible with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Ah, wait. I've been trying to visualize this as simple shapes, which might be limiting my understanding. But in topological terms, the boundary of a region doesn't have to be a simple curve.

For instance, imagine a shape with a "tendril" that extends out. The shape consists of a main body and this tendril, which is a part of the shape. If the tendril stretches out, it could touch another shape without the main body of the shape touching it.

Let's try to visualize a scenario:

- Imagine z as a simple circle.
- Imagine x as a shape that's mostly inside z, but has a small tendril that extends out of z. The main body of x is inside z, but this tendril pokes out. 
- Now, imagine y touching x only at the tip of this tendril, outside of z.

Wait, would this satisfy TPP(x,z)? For TPP(x,z), x needs to be a proper part of z, meaning every point of x is a point of z. But if x has a tendril that extends outside of z, then not every point of x is a point of z, violating TPP(x,z).

So, even with more complex shapes, TPP(x,z) doesn't seem compatible with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

I'm increasingly convinced that the possible RCC8 relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), are indeed: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, let me check PO(x,z) more carefully. For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. For EC(x,y), the boundaries of x and y touch. For DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points.

Imagine z as a circle, and x as a circle that overlaps partially with z. The part of x that doesn't overlap with z can be touched by y, satisfying EC(x,y) and DC(y,z). So, PO(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of x and z touch. For EC(x,y), the boundaries of x and y touch. For DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points. This is possible if y touches the boundary of x at a point away from where z is.

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x, and the boundaries of x and z don't touch. For EC(x,y), the boundaries of x and y touch. For DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points. This is possible if y touches the boundary of x at a point away from where z is.

So, the possible RCC8 relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually, hold on. I'm thinking about the NTPP case again. Let me try to construct a specific scenario to check if TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) could be possible:

For TPP(x,z), x is inside z, and at at least one point, the boundary of x touches the boundary of z. Let's say the boundary of x and boundary of z touch at point p. For EC(x,y), the boundaries of x and y touch. Let's say the boundaries of x and y touch at point q. For DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points.

If p and q are the same point, then y and z would share the point p, contradicting DC(y,z). So, p and q must be different.

But if q is different from p, then it's a point on the boundary of x that's inside z (since the boundary of x is inside or on the boundary of z due to TPP(x,z)). For y to touch the boundary of x at point q, y would have to intrude into z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), x is inside z, and the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of z. For EC(x,y), the boundaries of x and y touch. For DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points. If y touches the boundary of x, and the boundary of x is entirely inside z, then y would intrude into z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

So, the possible RCC8 relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), are indeed: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

OK, my final list:
DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

Looking at the constraints:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points
- DC(y,z): y and z are completely disconnected (share no points)

Let me analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch y at a boundary, while both x and z are completely disconnected from each other.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch z at a boundary point that's different from where x touches y.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z can partially overlap, while x still touches y at a boundary point that's outside the overlap region.

4. TPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained in z with x's boundary touching z's boundary. But if y touches x's boundary (from EC(x,y)), then y would have to either touch or intrude into z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y would have to intrude into z, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be entirely contained in x with their boundaries touching, while y touches x's boundary at a point away from z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while y touches x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This is not possible. If x and z are identical, and x touches y, then z would also touch y, contradicting DC(y,z).
