PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what the relationships mean and how they interact.

1. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now I need to think about what the relationship between x and z could be.

Given that EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but have no common interior points.
Given that TPP(y,z), y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected? 
   No, because y touches x at the boundary and y is part of z. So at minimum, x must touch z at the boundary where x touches y.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior?
   Yes, this is possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x can touch z at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   Yes, this is possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is part of z, then x could partially overlap with z, where the overlap region includes part of y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, this is possible. X could be entirely contained within z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   No, this is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   Yes, this is possible. Z could be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   No, because if y touches z's boundary and x touches y's boundary, then x must touch z's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   No, because y is a proper part of z, and x touches y at the boundary but isn't part of y. So x and z cannot be equal.

Wait, I need to be more careful and draw some pictures to make sure I'm reasoning correctly.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let me think about EC(x,z):
Since y touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, it's possible that x touches z at the boundary, making EC(x,z) possible.

Let me think about PO(x,z):
Since y is a tangential proper part of z, and x touches y at the boundary, it's possible that x partially overlaps with z. For example, imagine y as a small circle touching the boundary of a larger circle z, and x as another circle that touches y at the boundary and also extends into z.

Let me think about TPP(x,z):
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be entirely contained within z and touch z's boundary. This seems possible; for example, if x is a small circle that touches y at the boundary, and both x and y are contained within z with both touching z's boundary.

Let me think about TPPi(x,z):
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely contained within x and touch x's boundary. This doesn't seem possible because y is a proper part of z, so z is at least as large as y. And since x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't contain y, x cannot contain z either.

Let me rethink this one. If z is contained within x, and y is contained within z, then y is contained within x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me think about DC(x,z):
If x and y touch at the boundary, and y is part of z, then x must at least touch z at the boundary. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me think about NTPP(x,z):
For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be entirely contained within z and not touch z's boundary. But since x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary, this seems impossible.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. If y touches z's boundary, that doesn't mean that every point of y's boundary touches z's boundary. It's possible that the point where x touches y is in the interior of z, not on z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) could be possible.

Let me try to draw this scenario. Let's say z is a large circle, and y is a smaller circle that touches z's boundary at one point. Now, x could be another circle that touches y at a point, and this point is inside z, not on z's boundary. So x would be entirely contained within z and not touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) possible.

Let me think about NTPPi(x,z):
For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be entirely contained within x and not touch x's boundary. But since y is part of z and touches x at the boundary, z must also touch x at the boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me think about EQ(x,z):
For x and z to be equal, they must occupy the exact same space. But since y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Okay, let me reconsider all the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): No, because if y touches x at the boundary and y is part of z, then x must at least touch z at the boundary.

2. EC(x,z): Yes, if x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary at the same point, then x would touch z at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Yes, if x touches y at the boundary and also extends into z, then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Yes, if x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary (which could happen if the point where x touches y is also on z's boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z): Yes, if x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary (which could happen if the point where x touches y is inside z, not on z's boundary).

6. TPPi(x,z): No, because if y is a proper part of z and x only touches y at the boundary, then z cannot be a proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): No, because if y is a proper part of z and x touches y at the boundary, then z must also touch x at the boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): No, because if y is a proper part of z and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z cannot be the same.

Actually, I'm not sure about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let me think more carefully.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. But we know that x is outside of y and only touches y at the boundary (because EC(x,y)). Since y is a proper part of z, it's possible that x is also a proper part of z, but it's not necessary.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. If y is a tangential proper part of z, then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y at the boundary, and this point is also on z's boundary, then x could be either partially inside z (giving PO(x,z)) or entirely inside z and touching z's boundary (giving TPP(x,z)).

And if the point where x touches y is inside z, not on z's boundary, then x could be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary, giving NTPP(x,z).

I think the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But wait. I'm making a lot of assumptions about the relative positions. Let me think again, step by step, and try to draw all possible configurations.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

First, let's establish where y is. Y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and touches z's boundary at some point(s).

Now, where can x be? X touches y at the boundary, and doesn't share any interior with y. So x is outside of y.

Case 1: The point where x touches y is also on z's boundary.
In this case, x could be:
- Outside of z, touching z at the boundary: EC(x,z)
- Partly inside z: PO(x,z)
- Entirely inside z, touching z's boundary: TPP(x,z)

Case 2: The point where x touches y is inside z, not on z's boundary.
In this case, x could be:
- Partly inside z: PO(x,z)
- Entirely inside z, touching z's boundary at another point: TPP(x,z)
- Entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary: NTPP(x,z)

Case 3: X extends outside of z.
In this case, x could be:
- Outside of z, touching z at the boundary (where x touches y): EC(x,z)
- Partly inside z: PO(x,z)

So, the possible relationships are:
- EC(x,z): X is outside of z, touching z at the boundary.
- PO(x,z): X is partly inside z.
- TPP(x,z): X is entirely inside z, touching z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): X is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Actually, there's one more case I need to consider. What if x is so large that z is inside x?

If z is inside x, then y is also inside x (since y is inside z). But this contradicts EC(x,y), which says that x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior. So z cannot be inside x.

Actually, I need to be careful. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This doesn't mean that x is outside of y; it could also be that y is outside of x, or that they are partly overlapping in a very specific way where they only touch at the boundary.

But in all cases, if EC(x,y), then x and y are not overlapping in their interiors. So if y is inside z, and x doesn't overlap with y in the interior, then x and z can overlap in various ways.

Let me reconsider all possible cases:

Case 1: X is outside of z, touching z at the boundary.
This gives EC(x,z).

Case 2: X is partly inside z.
This gives PO(x,z).

Case 3: X is entirely inside z, touching z's boundary.
This gives TPP(x,z).

Case 4: X is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary.
This gives NTPP(x,z).

Case 5: Z is partly inside x.
This gives PO(x,z).

Case 6: Z is entirely inside x, touching x's boundary.
This gives TPPi(x,z).

Case 7: Z is entirely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
This gives NTPPi(x,z).

But cases 6 and 7 are problematic, because if z is inside x, then y is also inside x (since TPP(y,z) means y is inside z). But EC(x,y) says that x and y touch at the boundary and don't share interior, so y cannot be inside x. So cases 6 and 7 are not possible.

Case 8: X and z are the same.
This gives EQ(x,z). But this is also problematic because if x and z are the same, and y is inside z, then y is inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So case 8 is not possible.

So, the possible relationships are:
- EC(x,z): X is outside of z, touching z at the boundary.
- PO(x,z): X is partly inside z, or z is partly inside x.
- TPP(x,z): X is entirely inside z, touching z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): X is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Let me think about this once more and see if I missed anything.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

First, y is inside z and touches z's boundary. 
Second, x touches y at the boundary but doesn't share interior with y.

Actually, let's think about the TPPi(x,z) case again. For z to be inside x, y must also be inside x (since y is inside z). But EC(x,y) says that x and y touch at the boundary and don't share interior. If y is inside x, they would share interior, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z would be inside x and not touch x's boundary. But then y would also be inside x and not touch x's boundary, which contradicts EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

And for EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same. But then y would be inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me recheck the other cases:

EC(x,z): X is outside of z, touching z at the boundary. This is possible, for example, if x and z touch at the same point where x touches y.

PO(x,z): X is partly inside z. This is possible, for example, if x extends into z beyond the point where it touches y.

TPP(x,z): X is entirely inside z, touching z's boundary. This is possible, for example, if x is a small region inside z that touches z's boundary at the same point where it touches y.

Actually, I need to be more careful about TPP(x,z). If x is entirely inside z, and EC(x,y), and y is also inside z, then x and y must both touch z's boundary. But then x and y would share a part of z's boundary, which seems to contradict EC(x,y). So TPP(x,z) might not be possible.

Actually, let me think again. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior. If x is inside z, and y is inside z, and they both touch z's boundary, they could touch each other at a point on z's boundary without sharing interior. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): X is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This is possible, for example, if x is a small region inside z that touches y at a point, and this point is not on z's boundary.

Actually, I need to be more careful about NTPP(x,z) as well. If x is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary, and y is also inside z, touching z's boundary, then x and y would touch at a point inside z, not on z's boundary. But then x would have to touch y at a point that's not on z's boundary. Is this consistent with EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z)?

TPP(y,z) means that y is inside z and touches z's boundary. So y has some points that are on z's boundary, and some points that are inside z, not on z's boundary.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior. So x and y must touch at a point on y's boundary.

If this point is on z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, so x cannot be NTPP(x,z).

If this point is inside z, not on z's boundary, then x could be entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary, which would give NTPP(x,z).

So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): X is outside of z, touching z at the boundary.
- PO(x,z): X is partly inside z, or z is partly inside x.
- TPP(x,z): X is entirely inside z, touching z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): X is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Actually, I think there's a mistake in my reasoning again. The condition TPP(y,z) means that y is inside z and touches z's boundary. The condition EC(x,y) means that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't share interior with y.

So, x touches y at y's boundary. This could be at a point where y touches z's boundary, or at a point inside z, not on z's boundary. If it's at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, so x could be EC(x,z), PO(x,z), or TPP(x,z), but not NTPP(x,z).

If it's at a point inside z, not on z's boundary, then x would not necessarily touch z's boundary, so x could be PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z), but not EC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): X is outside of z, touching z at the boundary.
- PO(x,z): X is partly inside z.
- TPP(x,z): X is entirely inside z, touching z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): X is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Let me double-check this again to make sure it's correct.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

I know that y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
I know that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't share interior with y.

Case 1: X touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary.
In this case, x would also touch z's boundary, so x could be:
- Outside of z, touching z at the boundary: EC(x,z)
- Partly inside z, touching z's boundary: PO(x,z)
- Entirely inside z, touching z's boundary: TPP(x,z)

Case 2: X touches y at a point inside z, not on z's boundary.
In this case, x would not necessarily touch z's boundary, so x could be:
- Partly inside z: PO(x,z)
- Entirely inside z, touching z's boundary at another point: TPP(x,z)
- Entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary: NTPP(x,z)

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

So my answer is: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me try once more with the utmost care.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

I know that y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
I know that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't share interior with y.

Let's break this down carefully and systematically.

Where can x touch y?
1. X can touch y at a point where y touches z's boundary.
2. X can touch y at a point inside z, not on z's boundary.

Case 1: X touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary.
In this case, x also touches z's boundary.

Where can the rest of x be?
1a. The rest of x is entirely outside of z. This gives EC(x,z).
1b. The rest of x is partly inside z and partly outside. This gives PO(x,z).
1c. The rest of x is entirely inside z. This gives TPP(x,z).

Case 2: X touches y at a point inside z, not on z's boundary.
In this case, x is at least partly inside z.

Where can the rest of x be?
2a. The rest of x extends outside of z. This gives PO(x,z).
2b. The rest of x is entirely inside z, and some part of x touches z's boundary. This gives TPP(x,z).
2c. The rest of x is entirely inside z, and no part of x touches z's boundary. This gives NTPP(x,z).

So, combining the possibilities from both cases, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): Case 1a
- PO(x,z): Cases 1b, 2a
- TPP(x,z): Cases 1c, 2b
- NTPP(x,z): Case 2c

So, the possible relationships are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I think I need to check case 1c again. If EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary and doesn't share interior with y. But if x is entirely inside z, and y is inside z, then how can x not share interior with y? The only way this could work is if x is a tangent to y from the inside of z, which is indeed possible. So TPP(x,z) is still a valid possibility for case 1c.

Alright, I'll stick with my answer: the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm going to make one more check and one more check only.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior.
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): X and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): X touches z at the boundary but doesn't share interior.
- PO(x,z): X and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): X is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): X is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): Z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): Z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): X and z are equal.

Let's examine each:

DC(x,z): This means x and z don't touch at all. But since x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, touching z's boundary, x must at least touch z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): This means x touches z at the boundary but doesn't share interior. This is possible, for example, if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, and the rest of x is outside of z.

PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible, for example, if x touches y at the boundary, and part of x extends inside z, and part extends outside.

TPP(x,z): This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible, for example, if x is a small region inside z that touches z's boundary at the same point where it touches y.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible, for example, if x is a small region inside z that touches y at a point inside z, not on z's boundary.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But since y is inside z, this would mean y is inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this would mean y is inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. But since y is inside z, this would mean y is inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine what possible RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary).

Let me analyze the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since x touches y's boundary and y is part of z, x must at least touch z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, and x remains outside z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible if x touches y at the boundary but partially extends into z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary (which can happen if x touches y at a point on z's boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (which can happen if x touches y at a point inside z, not on z's boundary).

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible because if z were inside x, then y would also be inside x (since y is inside z), contradicting EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because if x equals z, then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
