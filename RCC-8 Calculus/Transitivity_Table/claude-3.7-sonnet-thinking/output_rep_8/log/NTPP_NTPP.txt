PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's consider what we know:
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary

So we have x is properly inside y (without touching y's boundary), and y is properly inside z (without touching z's boundary).

From this, we can deduce that x must also be inside z. But what's the exact relationship?

Since x is properly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is properly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, it follows that x must be properly inside z and cannot touch z's boundary.

Why? Because if x were to touch z's boundary, it would have to cross through y's interior and y's boundary, and then cross z's boundary to touch it. But we know that x doesn't even touch y's boundary, so it certainly can't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

To double-check: 
- x is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary
- y is properly contained in z without touching z's boundary
- Therefore, x is properly contained in z without touching z's boundary, which is NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me make sure. Could there be any other possible relationships?

Let's go through the RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,z): No, x and z cannot be disconnected because x is inside y which is inside z.
- EC(x,z): No, x cannot externally connect to z (touch at boundary) because x doesn't even touch y's boundary, let alone z's.
- PO(x,z): No, x cannot partially overlap z because x is fully contained within y which is fully contained within z.
- TPP(x,z): No, x cannot be a tangential proper part of z because that would require x to touch z's boundary, which is impossible given that x doesn't touch y's boundary and y doesn't touch z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): Yes, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, as we've established.
- TPPi(x,z): No, z cannot be a tangential proper part of x because we know x is contained within z, not the other way around.
- NTPPi(x,z): No, z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x for the same reason.
- EQ(x,z): No, x and z cannot be equal because x is properly contained within y, which is properly contained within z.

So the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double check the logic here, considering the nesting of regions:
- x is properly contained within y (NTPP(x,y))
- y is properly contained within z (NTPP(y,z))

To visualize this, imagine three concentric circles: x is the innermost circle, y is the middle circle, and z is the outermost circle. The innermost circle (x) doesn't touch the boundary of the middle circle (y), and the middle circle doesn't touch the boundary of the outermost circle (z).

In this configuration, the innermost circle (x) clearly doesn't touch the boundary of the outermost circle (z). Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is: NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let me analyze this step by step:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Since x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Visually, this is like three nested circles where the innermost circle (x) has a gap between it and the middle circle (y), and the middle circle has a gap between it and the outer circle (z).

In this arrangement, x cannot possibly touch z's boundary since it doesn't even touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
