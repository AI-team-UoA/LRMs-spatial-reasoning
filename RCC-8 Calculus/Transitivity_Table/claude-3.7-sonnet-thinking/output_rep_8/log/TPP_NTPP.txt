PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the relations we're given:

1. TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z) means that y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's think about the physical interpretation to understand what's going on:
- x is a part of y and touches y's boundary.
- y is a part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, we know by transitivity that x is a part of z. But the question is: does x touch the boundary of z or not?

Since y does not touch the boundary of z (due to NTPP(y,z)), and x is contained within y except possibly at y's boundary, it seems that x cannot touch the boundary of z. This is because to touch the boundary of z, x would need to extend beyond y, which it doesn't.

So it seems like the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z), meaning x is a part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Let me double-check this reasoning:

- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

For x to touch the boundary of z, it would need to have a point in common with the boundary of z. But since y is entirely in the interior of z (as given by NTPP(y,z)), and x is contained within y or at most touches y's boundary (as given by TPP(x,y)), x cannot touch the boundary of z.

So, I believe the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider this more carefully. I want to make sure I understand the definitions correctly. 

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is contained within y and is not equal to y) and x touches the boundary of y.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that y is a proper part of z (i.e., y is contained within z and is not equal to z) and y does not touch the boundary of z.

Given these definitions, since x touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)), and y is strictly inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), the question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

Since y is strictly inside z, and x is contained within y but touches y's boundary, it seems like x would still be strictly inside z. This is because the boundary of y that x touches is still within the interior of z. So, the relation between x and z should be NTPP(x,z).

However, let me consider if there's any way that x could touch the boundary of z while still satisfying the given conditions.

If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then x is touching the boundary of y, and y is not touching the boundary of z. Since y is strictly inside z, and x is within y, it seems like x cannot touch the boundary of z. Thus, I still think the relation is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm having a bit of doubt. Let me try to draw out the scenario.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Imagine z as a large circle, and y as a smaller circle inside z, not touching the boundary of z. Now, x is a region inside y, and it touches the boundary of y. Given these conditions, x is indeed a proper part of z, and it does not touch the boundary of z.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z), which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, wait, I was thinking incorrectly earlier. I need to be more precise about the definitions.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, which means that x is a proper part of y and there is at least one point that is on the boundary of both x and y.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means that y is a proper part of z and there is no point that is on the boundary of both y and z.

Given these definitions, if x touches the boundary of y, and y is strictly inside z, then x is still strictly inside z. So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me think through this again. Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), could the relation between x and z be TPP(x,z)?

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to touch the boundary of z. But since y is strictly inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), and x is inside y (with possibly some parts of x touching the boundary of y, but not extending beyond y), it seems like x cannot touch the boundary of z.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, actually, I think I'm being confused about the exact definition of "touching" in this context. Let me revisit the definitions of TPP and NTPP:

- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is a proper part of y and the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is a proper part of y and the boundary of x does not intersect with the boundary of y.

Given these definitions, if TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then x is a proper part of y with some boundary points in common with y, and y is a proper part of z with no boundary points in common with z. Since the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z, and the boundary of x only intersects with the boundary of y, it seems like the boundary of x cannot intersect with the boundary of z.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Alright, I'll do one final check.

TPP(x,y) means that:
1. x is a proper part of y.
2. The boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y.

NTPP(y,z) means that:
1. y is a proper part of z.
2. The boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z.

Given these conditions, can the boundary of x intersect with the boundary of z?

Since the boundary of y does not intersect with the boundary of z, and the boundary of x only intersects with the boundary of y, it seems like the boundary of x cannot intersect with the boundary of z. Thus, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is: NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary

Let's analyze what this means spatially:
- x is inside y and touches y's boundary
- y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Since x is contained within y (as a proper part), and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x must also be completely inside z. 

Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x doesn't extend beyond y (x only goes as far as y's boundary at most), x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
