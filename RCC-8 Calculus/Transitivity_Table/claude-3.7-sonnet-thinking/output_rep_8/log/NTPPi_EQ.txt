PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, I need to figure out what the relationship between $x$ and $z$ could be, given that $\text{NTPPi}(x,y)$ and $\text{EQ}(y,z)$.

Let's break down what these relations mean:

1. $\text{NTPPi}(x,y)$ means $\text{NTPP}(y,x)$, which means that $y$ is a proper part of $x$ and $y$ does not touch the boundary of $x$. In other words, $y$ is a "non-tangential proper part" of $x$.

2. $\text{EQ}(y,z)$ means that $y$ and $z$ are coincident, i.e., they occupy the exact same spatial region.

Now, if $y$ and $z$ are the same spatial region, and $y$ is a non-tangential proper part of $x$, then $z$ must also be a non-tangential proper part of $x$. That is, $\text{NTPP}(z,x)$ or equivalently, $\text{NTPPi}(x,z)$.

So, the relationship between $x$ and $z$ is $\text{NTPPi}(x,z)$.

Actually, let's just double-check this reasoning.

Given:
- $\text{NTPPi}(x,y)$ means $\text{NTPP}(y,x)$, which means that $y$ is a proper part of $x$ and $y$ does not touch the boundary of $x$.
- $\text{EQ}(y,z)$ means that $y$ and $z$ are coincident.

If $y$ and $z$ are coincident, then they are identical in terms of spatial regions.
If $y$ is a non-tangential proper part of $x$, and $z$ is identical to $y$, then $z$ is also a non-tangential proper part of $x$.

Therefore, $\text{NTPP}(z,x)$ or equivalently, $\text{NTPPi}(x,z)$.

The relationship between $x$ and $z$ is $\text{NTPPi}(x,z)$.

ANSWER:

Let me work through this step by step:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Given these two relations, I need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since y and z are coincident (they are effectively the same region), and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which means:

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
