PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully analyze this step by step.

We know:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), we can effectively substitute z for y in our first relationship. This gives us:
TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z

So the answer is simply TPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same spatial region. Therefore, if x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is equivalent to z, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. 

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y
- x touches y's boundary

EQ(y,z) means:
- y and z are the same spatial region

If y and z are the same spatial region, then:
- The boundary of y is the same as the boundary of z
- The interior of y is the same as the interior of z

Therefore:
- x is a proper part of z (because x is a proper part of y, and y=z)
- x touches the boundary of z (because x touches the boundary of y, and the boundary of y is the same as the boundary of z)

This is precisely the definition of TPP(x,z).

So my answer is correct: the only possible relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relation holds between x and z given TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y - x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Since y and z occupy the exact same space:
- If x is a proper part of y, then x must be a proper part of z
- If x touches y's boundary, then x must touch z's boundary (since y and z have identical boundaries)

Therefore, x must be a tangential proper part of z, which means TPP(x,z).

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
