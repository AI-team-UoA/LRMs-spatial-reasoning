PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We are given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is a proper part of y and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Now we need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Since both x and z are parts of y, they must be in one of the following relationships:
1. DC(x,z): disconnected
2. EC(x,z): externally connected
3. PO(x,z): partially overlapping
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal

Let's analyze each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are completely separate. This is possible because x touches the boundary of y, while z is completely inside y (not touching its boundary). So x and z could be in different parts of y without touching.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is also possible for the same reason as DC. Since x touches the boundary of y and z is completely inside y, they could just be touching at some point.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible since both are inside y, and they could share some parts without one being completely inside the other.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z completely contains x and x touches the boundary of z. Since z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, this would mean that part of z must also be close to y's boundary (to include x), but not touching it.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is not possible because if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, then x couldn't touch y's boundary. But we know TPP(x,y), so x does touch y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x completely contains z and z touches the boundary of x. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, but is inside y, and x touches the boundary of y, this could happen if part of x's boundary that touches y also happens to touch z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Since z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, this could happen if z is "deeply" embedded within both x and y.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is not possible because we know x touches the boundary of y (TPP(x,y)), but z does not touch the boundary of y (NTPP(z,y)).

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let me double-check this:

NTPP(x,z) would mean x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But we know x touches y's boundary, and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary. If x were completely inside z, and z is completely inside y (away from the boundary), then x couldn't touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are identical. But x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be identical.

Let me once more think about TPP(x,z). TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. But if z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, how could x both be inside z and touch y's boundary? Well, it's possible if part of z's boundary is close to y's boundary, and x touches both boundaries at that point. But actually I realize there's a problem: if x touches y's boundary, and x is a proper part of z, then z must also touch y's boundary. But we know NTPP(z,y), which means z does not touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

So my corrected list of possible relations between x and z is: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let me think about these differently. We're given that NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary. And TPP(x,y), which means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is near the boundary of y, and z is further inside y, and they don't touch.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if x is near the boundary of y, and z reaches close to but doesn't touch the boundary of y, and they just touch at some point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x extends into z, and part of z extends outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and is completely inside z, then z must also touch y's boundary. But NTPP(z,y) means z doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary. But NTPP(z,y) means z doesn't touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and is also completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and x touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and is also deep inside x without touching x's boundary, and x touches y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Hmm, but I need to think more about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z), it's not clear to me if it's impossible. TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary and is a proper part of z, does that necessarily mean z touches y's boundary? If x touches the boundary of y at a point p, and also touches the boundary of z at a different point q, then it's possible for z to be completely inside y (not touching y's boundary) while x is inside z and touches z's boundary at q and y's boundary at p.

Actually, I realize I was making a mistake. TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. It doesn't necessarily imply that if x touches y's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary. Let's think about it this way: x is a region inside z that touches part of z's boundary. Separately, x also touches y's boundary. Since z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), this means part of z must be very close to y's boundary, close enough that x, which is inside z and touches z's boundary, can also touch y's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is possible.

What about NTPP(x,z)? NTPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. But we know x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)). If x is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and also touches y's boundary, then z must extend beyond x in the direction of y's boundary, which means z must also touch y's boundary. But we know NTPP(z,y), which means z doesn't touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

But I realize I'm going back and forth on this, so let me think carefully about TPP(x,z) with a concrete example.

Imagine y is a large square, and z is a smaller square completely inside y (not touching y's boundary). Now, if x is a small rectangle that's completely inside z (so it's a proper part of z), and also extends to touch y's boundary, then z would also have to extend to touch y's boundary (to contain x), which contradicts NTPP(z,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I think the issue is I was not being precise about what it means for x to "touch" the boundaries of both y and z. If x touches the boundary of y at a point p, and touches the boundary of z at a different point q, then for x to be a proper part of z, z must contain all of x, including the point p where x touches y's boundary. But if z contains p, and p is on y's boundary, then z touches y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(z,y).

So my final conclusion is that the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, no, let's draw it out once more. 

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is completely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is near the boundary of y, and z is further inside y, and they don't touch.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if x is near the boundary of y, and z is further inside y but reaches close enough to touch x at a point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x overlaps with part of z, but neither is a proper part of the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary and is completely inside z, then z must also extend to y's boundary to contain all of x. But NTPP(z,y) means z doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary and is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then z must extend beyond x to y's boundary. But NTPP(z,y) means z doesn't touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and is also completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and x touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and is also deep inside x without touching x's boundary, and x touches y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Alright, I think I've been going in circles a bit, so let's try a slightly different approach. The key is to understand what TPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y) tell us, and then see which of the 8 RCC-8 relations between x and z are consistent with these constraints.

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
- x is a proper part of y (all of x is inside y, and x is not equal to y)
- x touches the boundary of y (there's at least one point of x that's on the boundary of y)

NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is a proper part of y (all of z is inside y, and z is not equal to y)
- z does not touch the boundary of y (no point of z is on the boundary of y)

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. X can be in one part of y (touching y's boundary), and z can be in another part of y (not touching y's boundary), and they don't overlap or touch.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible. X can be in one part of y (touching y's boundary), and z can be in another part of y (not touching y's boundary), and they just touch at a point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. Part of x can overlap with part of z, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and is fully inside z, then z must also touch y's boundary (because z contains all of x, including the part that touches y's boundary). But we're told z doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and is fully inside z without touching z's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary (because z surrounds all of x, including the part that touches y's boundary). But we're told z doesn't touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. Z can be completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and also completely inside x (touching x's boundary), and x can touch y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible. Z can be completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and also deep inside x (not touching x's boundary), and x can touch y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be the same region.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let me double-check TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) once more to make sure my reasoning is correct.

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. We know x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)). If x is fully inside z and touches both z's boundary and y's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary (because z contains all of x, including the part that touches y's boundary). But NTPP(z,y) tells us z doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. We know x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)). If x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, but does touch y's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary (because z surrounds all of x, including the part that touches y's boundary). But NTPP(z,y) tells us z doesn't touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So my final conclusion is that the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually I think I should draw this out one more time to make sure this is correct.

Let's say y is a large circle, and we're considering the possible relationships between x and z, where TPP(x,y) and NTPP(z,y).

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is fully inside y and touches y's boundary at at least one point. So we can visualize x as a smaller shape inside y that touches the boundary of y at some point.

NTPP(z,y) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is fully inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary at any point. So we can visualize z as a smaller shape completely inside y, with some gap between z and the boundary of y.

Now, let's consider the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is in one part of y (touching y's boundary), and z is in another part of y (not touching y's boundary), and they don't overlap or touch.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x is in one part of y (touching y's boundary), and z is in another part of y (not touching y's boundary), and they just touch at a point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of x overlaps with part of z, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and is fully inside z, then z must also touch y's boundary (because z contains all of x, including the part that touches y's boundary). But we're told z doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and is fully inside z without touching z's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary (because z surrounds all of x, including the part that touches y's boundary). But we're told z doesn't touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and also completely inside x (touching x's boundary), and x touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and also deep inside x (not touching x's boundary), and x touches y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is not possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be the same region.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

I'm confident in my conclusion:

The possible relations between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Or, listing them out in full:

DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected
PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what constraints the given relations place on the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary)

Let me consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x can be near y's boundary while z is completely inside y, with no overlap.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z can partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were inside z and touched z's boundary, while also touching y's boundary, then z would also have to touch y's boundary (to contain that part of x). But this contradicts NTPP(z,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For similar reasons as TPP(x,z) - if x touches y's boundary and is completely inside z, then z must also touch y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. x touches y's boundary but z doesn't, so they cannot be equal.
