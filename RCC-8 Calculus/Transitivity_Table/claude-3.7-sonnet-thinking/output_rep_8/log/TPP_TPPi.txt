PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what we're given:
1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. So x is a part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, but the "i" indicates it's the inverse relation. So TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

So we have:
- x is a tangential proper part of y
- z is a tangential proper part of y

Now I need to determine what the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z could be, given these constraints.

Since both x and z are parts of y, let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Since both x and z are parts of y, they both share spatial regions with y. But they could be disconnected from each other within y. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts. Since both x and z are within y, they could just touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial region, but neither is part of the other. Since both x and z are parts of y, they could certainly overlap partially within y. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, and x is also a tangential proper part of y, it's possible that x is a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, and x is also a tangential proper part of y, it's possible that x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, and x is also a tangential proper part of y, it's possible that z is a tangential proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, and x is also a tangential proper part of y, it's possible that z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical in spatial extent. Given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, it's possible that they are the same spatial region. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

So it seems like all 8 relations are possible. But let me think more carefully to see if I can rule any out.

Actually, wait, I made a mistake. We have TPPi(y, z), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. But I accidentally interpreted it as y is a tangential proper part of z. Let me reconsider.

1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y.
2. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. (This is correct.)

So we have:
- x is a tangential proper part of y
- z is a tangential proper part of y

This means both x and z are parts of y and both touch y's boundary. Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they have no spatial parts in common. Since both are within y, they could be disconnected from each other. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap, this is consistent with both being parts of y. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, this is consistent with both being parts of y. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, this means x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. Given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, x could be a tangential proper part of z if z is a larger part of y. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, this means x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, x could be a non-tangential proper part of z if z is a larger part of y and x is entirely within z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, this means z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. Given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, z could be a tangential proper part of x if x is a larger part of y. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, this means z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, z could be a non-tangential proper part of x if x is a larger part of y and z is entirely within x without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, they are the same spatial region. This is consistent with both being tangential proper parts of y, as they could be the same tangential proper part. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

So all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

Hmm, that seems suspicious. Let me think again. We have:
1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y.
2. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

Given these constraints, can x and z be in all possible relations? Let's check each.

The relation TPPi(y,z) gives us that z is a tangential proper part of y. Now, TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. So both x and z are tangential proper parts of y.

Let's imagine this visually. Imagine y as a larger region, and both x and z are smaller regions inside y, both touching y's boundary.

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, they can be two separate parts of y, not touching. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping? Yes, they can be two separate parts of y that just touch at a boundary. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they can be two parts of y that share some region but also have parts outside of each other. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, if z is a larger part of y and x is entirely within z, touching z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, if z is a larger part of y and x is entirely within z, not touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if x is a larger part of y and z is entirely within x, touching x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if x is a larger part of y and z is entirely within x, not touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be the same region? Yes, they can be the same tangential proper part of y. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

So all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

Actually, let me re-examine 4 and 5 more carefully. 

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But since both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, and touch y's boundary, it's possible that x touches the boundary of y exactly where z touches the boundary of y. So x touches z's boundary, and TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary. But since x is a tangential proper part of y, it touches y's boundary. And since z is also a tangential proper part of y, it also touches y's boundary. If x is within z, and both touch y's boundary, then x must touch z's boundary at exactly the point where they both touch y's boundary. This means x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me also re-examine 7 for the same reason.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Using the same reasoning as in 5, if z is within x and both touch y's boundary, then z must touch x's boundary at exactly the point where they both touch y's boundary. This means z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

I've realized an issue in my reasoning. Let me step back and be more precise about what TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) mean.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y (i.e., completely contained within y) and touches y's boundary. It doesn't mean that x touches all of y's boundary. It just means that x touches y's boundary at at least one point.

Similarly, TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

So with that understanding, let's reconsider the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if they are separate parts of y, not touching. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping? Yes, if they just touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if they share some region but also have parts outside each other. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x must be fully contained within z and touch z's boundary. Since both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, they both touch y's boundary. If x is within z, then the only place x can touch y's boundary is where z also touches y's boundary. This is possible. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? For this to be true, x must be fully contained within z and not touch z's boundary. But since x is a tangential proper part of y, it touches y's boundary. If x is within z and touches y's boundary, it must touch z's boundary at the same point. So x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z. NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of TPP, so it means that z is a tangential proper part of x. Using similar reasoning as in 4, this is possible. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Using similar reasoning as in 5, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be the same region? Yes, they can be the same tangential proper part of y. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

Actually, I think I'm being confused by what "touches the boundary" means. Let me reconsider.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. This means that the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y at at least one point.

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. This means that the boundary of z intersects with the boundary of y at at least one point.

With this understanding, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

Actually, I realized there's another mistake in my reasoning. I was saying that if x and z both touch the boundary of y, and x is inside z, then x must touch the boundary of z. But that's not necessarily true. x could touch a part of y's boundary that z doesn't touch, and vice versa.

Let me revisit the problem once more with a clearer understanding. We have:
1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. So x is completely contained within y, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y at at least one point.
2. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. So z is completely contained within y, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of y at at least one point.

Actually, no, I made another mistake. TPPi is the inverse of TPP, so TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

So we have:
1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. So x is completely contained within y, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y at at least one point.
2. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is completely contained within y, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of y at at least one point.

So both x and z are tangential proper parts of y.

Let's revisit the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if they are separate parts of y, not touching. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping? Yes, if they just touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if they share some region but also have parts outside each other. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This means x is fully contained within z and the boundary of x touches the boundary of z. This is possible if z is a larger part of y, and x is within z, with the boundary of x touching the boundary of z (possibly at a point where both touch the boundary of y). So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This means x is fully contained within z and the boundary of x does not touch the boundary of z. This is only possible if the boundary of x touches a part of the boundary of y that the boundary of z does not touch. But since z is a part of y, the boundary of y that is interior to z cannot be touched by x (since x is a part of z in this scenario). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility. (But actually, let me think more about this. Why couldn't x be completely inside z, such that the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of z? It feels like I'm missing something.)

Actually, hold on. I'm getting confused because I'm trying to do the spatial reasoning with concrete shapes in my head. Let me try a more formal approach.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is fully contained within y and x ≠ y).
- The boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means:
- z is a proper part of y (i.e., z is fully contained within y and z ≠ y).
- The boundary of z intersects with the boundary of y.

So both x and z are proper parts of y, and both touch the boundary of y.

Let's consider the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This means they have no points in common. Since both are within y, they can be separate parts of y. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but have no interior points in common. This is possible if they are separate parts of y that just touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means they share some points, but each also has points that the other doesn't. This is possible if they are overlapping parts of y. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully contained within z, x ≠ z, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of z. This is possible if z is a larger part of y and x is within z, with the boundary of x touching the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully contained within z, x ≠ z, and the boundary of x does not touch the boundary of z. 

   Let's really think about this. If x is a tangential proper part of y, then the boundary of x touches the boundary of y. If x is also a non-tangential proper part of z, then the boundary of x does not touch the boundary of z. But z is a tangential proper part of y, so the boundary of z touches the boundary of y. 
   
   Can x touch the boundary of y without touching the boundary of z, even though z touches the boundary of y? Yes, if the part of the boundary of y that x touches is different from the part that z touches. But wait, if x is fully contained within z, and x touches the boundary of y, then x must touch the boundary of z at exactly the point where z touches the boundary of y. 
   
   Actually, no, I'm still reasoning incorrectly. Let's be precise. x touches the boundary of y at some point p. z also touches the boundary of y, possibly at a different point q. If x is fully within z, then the boundary of x can only touch the boundary of y at a point that is also on the boundary of z. So p must be on the boundary of z as well. This means the boundary of x touches the boundary of z, so x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Wait, I think I'm still missing something. Let me reconsider the case NTPP(x,z) more carefully.

NTPP(x,z) means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully contained within z, and the boundary of x does not touch the boundary of z.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is fully contained within y, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is fully contained within y, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of y.

Let's consider a scenario where NTPP(x,z) is true. This means x is fully within z, and the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of z. 

Since TPP(x,y) is true, the boundary of x touches the boundary of y at some point p. 

Since TPPi(y,z) is true, z is fully within y, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of y at some point q.

Can x touch the boundary of y without touching the boundary of z, even though x is fully within z? This is only possible if p is not on the boundary of z.

But wait, if x is fully within z, and p is on the boundary of x and also on the boundary of y, then p must also be on the boundary of z. This means the boundary of x touches the boundary of z, contradicting NTPP(x,z).

So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Using similar reasoning, NTPPi(x,z) is also not a possibility.

I think the confusion arises from the spatial reasoning, which can be tricky to do abstractly. Let me try to visualize concrete shapes.

Imagine y as a large circle. Both x and z are smaller shapes fully contained within y, and both touch the boundary of y.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be fully within z, and the boundary of x would not touch the boundary of z. But if the boundary of x touches the boundary of y, and x is fully within z, then the boundary of x must touch the boundary of z at exactly the point where both touch the boundary of y.

But hold on. What if the boundary of z touches the boundary of y at multiple points, forming a sort of "bay" in z? Then x could be fully within this bay, touching the boundary of y without touching the boundary of z.

Actually, no. If x is in a "bay" of z and touches the boundary of y, then it must also touch the boundary of z, because the bay is formed by the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is still not a possibility.

Let me try another approach. Here's a formal proof:

1. TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, and the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y.
2. TPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y, and the boundary of z intersects with the boundary of y.
3. NTPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z, and the boundary of x does not intersect with the boundary of z.

Assume NTPP(x,z) is true.

From TPP(x,y), there is a point p that is on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

From NTPP(x,z), p is not on the boundary of z.

But since x is a proper part of z, and z is a proper part of y, p is on both the boundary of x and the boundary of y, but not on the boundary of z. This is only possible if p is in the interior of z. But then p cannot be on the boundary of y, which contradicts the fact that p is on the boundary of y.

So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Similar reasoning shows that NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me think more about the relationship between NTPP(x,z) and the constraint TPP(x,y). For this to be true, the only way x could touch the boundary of y without touching the boundary of z is if x touches a part of the boundary of y that is not on the boundary of z.

But since TPPi(y,z) is true, z is a proper part of y, and the boundary of z touches the boundary of y. So the boundary of y is a union of two disjoint parts: a part that is also the boundary of z, and a part that is not.

If NTPP(x,z) is true, then x is fully within z, and the boundary of x does not touch the boundary of z. But then the boundary of x can only touch the boundary of y at points that are also on the boundary of z. This is a contradiction.

So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not a possibility.

Let's double-check this with a concrete example. Imagine y as a large circle, and z as a smaller circle fully contained within y, touching the boundary of y at one point. For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would be a yet smaller circle fully contained within z, not touching the boundary of z. But then x couldn't touch the boundary of y, contradicting TPP(x,y).

I am confident that NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility. Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me revisit TPP(x,z). For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z, and the boundary of x must touch the boundary of z. Given that both x and z touch the boundary of y, it's possible that x is fully within z, and the boundaries of x and z touch at a point that is also on the boundary of y. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Similarly, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

Finally, let me reconsider EQ(x,z). For this to be true, x and z must be the same region. Given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, it's possible that they are the same tangential proper part. So EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

These are the 6 possible relations between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually, I think I'm being too hasty. Let me create some concrete scenarios to check if NTPP(x,z) is really not a possibility. Hmm... actually, I'm being thrown off by the fact that I have been trying to imagine the interior and exterior of curves which requires thinking about points not on the curves (which is outside the scope of RCC). 

Let me try with regions (which is what RCC-8 is designed for). Imagine y as a large square. z is a smaller square fully contained within y, with one edge of z coinciding with one edge of y. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would be a yet smaller square fully contained within z, with one edge of x coinciding with one edge of z (which might be the edge that also coincides with the edge of y). 

So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would be a yet smaller square fully contained within z, with no edges of x coinciding with edges of z. But then no edges of x could coincide with edges of y, contradicting TPP(x,y).

So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would be fully contained within x, with one edge of z coinciding with one edge of x.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would be fully contained within x, with no edges of z coinciding with edges of x. But then no edges of z could coincide with edges of y, contradicting TPPi(y,z).

So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would be the same square, fully contained within y, with one edge coinciding with one edge of y.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z would be separate squares within y, not touching. Each would have one edge coinciding with an edge of y.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would be separate squares within y, touching at a corner or an edge. Each would have one edge coinciding with an edge of y.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z would be overlapping squares within y, neither fully containing the other. Each would have one edge coinciding with an edge of y.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

So we've narrowed down the possible RCC-8 relations to the 6 above.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and touches y's boundary).

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained in y and touches y's boundary).

So both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x and z can be separate regions within y that don't touch.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x and z can touch at their boundaries without overlapping.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap within y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x couldn't touch y's boundary, contradicting TPP(x,y).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then z couldn't touch y's boundary, contradicting TPPi(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be the same region.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
