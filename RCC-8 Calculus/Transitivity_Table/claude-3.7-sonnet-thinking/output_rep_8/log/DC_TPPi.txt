PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the given relations:
1. DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which indicates that z is a tangential proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since DC(x,y), x and y don't share any spatial parts. And since TPPi(y,z), z is entirely contained within y, but touches y's boundary.

Given these two conditions, let's reason through the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Since z is entirely contained within y (as TPPi(y,z) or TPP(z,y)), and x is disconnected from y (as DC(x,y)), x must be disconnected from z as well. This is definitely a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Since z touches y's boundary (as TPPi(y,z) or TPP(z,y)), and x is disconnected from y (as DC(x,y)), it's possible that x touches z exactly at the point where z touches y's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share a spatial part, but neither is entirely contained within the other. However, since z is entirely contained within y (as TPPi(y,z) or TPP(z,y)), and x is disconnected from y (as DC(x,y)), x cannot share any part with z. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. However, since z is entirely contained within y (as TPPi(y,z) or TPP(z,y)), and x is disconnected from y (as DC(x,y)), x cannot be a part of z. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary. Similar to the above, since x is disconnected from y, it cannot be a part of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. But since z is entirely contained within y (as TPPi(y,z) or TPP(z,y)), and x is disconnected from y (as DC(x,y)), z cannot be a part of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary. Similar to the above, since z is entirely contained within y, and x is disconnected from y, z cannot be a part of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. But since z is entirely contained within y (as TPPi(y,z) or TPP(z,y)), and x is disconnected from y (as DC(x,y)), x and z cannot be coincident. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Wait, I need to more carefully think about EC(x,z) again. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a part of y but with z touching the boundary of y. Since x is disconnected from y, it's outside of y. So, x and z have y's boundary between them. This means x and z cannot directly touch, so EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Now I'm not sure about this. Let me think more carefully.

DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, touching y's boundary.

Let's visualize it:
- y is a region.
- z is entirely inside y, but touches y's boundary at some point.
- x is completely outside of y, not even touching y's boundary.

Given this visualization:
- x and z are separated by y's boundary, which means x and z are disconnected.
- x cannot touch z because they're separated by y's boundary.
- x cannot overlap with z since z is entirely inside y and x is entirely outside y.
- x cannot be a part of z since x is entirely outside y and z is entirely inside y.
- z cannot be a part of x for the same reason.
- x and z cannot be equal for the same reason.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, I'm still not sure about EC(x,z). Let me reason more clearly.

We have:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. This means x is entirely outside of y and doesn't even touch y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y, touching y's boundary.

Consider a scenario where z touches y's boundary at a specific point P.
- Since DC(x,y), x is entirely outside of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- This means x doesn't touch the point P or any other point on y's boundary.
- Since P is the only place where z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't touch P, it follows that x doesn't touch z.

Therefore, x and z are disconnected, so DC(x,z) is the only possible relation.

Hmm, but now I'm reconsidering. Suppose z extends right up to the boundary of y, and x is just on the other side of that boundary. Could they touch? Well, since DC(x,y), x doesn't even touch y's boundary. Therefore, x and z cannot touch either, so EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

I'm beginning to doubt my reasoning, so let me be more methodical.

We have:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. This means x is entirely outside of y and doesn't even touch y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y, touching y's boundary.

Now, let's reason about the possible relationships between x and z:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is a possible relation. As we've seen, x is entirely outside of y, and z is entirely inside y, so they are disconnected.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior. But, as we've discussed, since DC(x,y), x doesn't even touch y's boundary. Therefore, x cannot touch z either. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior. But since z is entirely inside y and x is entirely outside y, x and z cannot overlap. So, PO(x,z) is not a possible relation.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. But since x is entirely outside y and z is entirely inside y, x cannot be a part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to the above, since x is entirely outside y and z is entirely inside y, x cannot be a part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. But since z is entirely inside y and x is entirely outside y, z cannot be a part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the above, since z is entirely inside y and x is entirely outside y, z cannot be a part of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. But since z is entirely inside y and x is entirely outside y, x and z cannot be coincident. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Based on the above, DC(x,z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

Actually, maybe I need to reconsider my understanding of TPPi(y,z). Let me think again:

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's revisit our visualization:
- y is a region.
- z is entirely inside y, but touches y's boundary at some points.
- x is completely outside of y, not even touching y's boundary.

Given this, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

DC(x,z): Since x is outside of y and z is inside y, they are disconnected. This is a possible relation.

EC(x,z): For x and z to touch, they would need to meet at some point. Since z touches y's boundary and x is outside of y, there's a potential for x and z to touch at the boundary of y. However, DC(x,y) specifically says that x and y don't even touch; they're entirely disconnected. This means x is away from y's boundary. Since z can only extend up to y's boundary (and not beyond), x and z cannot touch. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are all not possible for the reasons given earlier. Since z is entirely inside y and x is entirely outside y, they cannot overlap, one cannot be a part of the other, and they cannot be equal.

I believe DC(x,z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

Wait, I think I may be confusing things a bit. Let me take a step back and reconsider the exact definitions of the relations:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts. They don't overlap and don't even touch.
EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. They are externally connected.
PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is entirely contained within the other. They partially overlap.
TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, touching y's boundary. x is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, not touching y's boundary. x is entirely contained within y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y): Inverse of TPP, so TPP(y,x). y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(x,y): Inverse of NTPP, so NTPP(y,x). y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident. They occupy the exact same space.

Now, with these definitions in mind, let's reconsider the relations:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They don't overlap and don't touch.
TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y, touching y's boundary.

Visualizing:
- y is a region.
- z is entirely inside y, touching y's boundary at some points.
- x is outside of y, not even touching y's boundary.

Given this, the relations between x and z:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Since x is outside of y and z is inside y, they are disconnected. This is a possible relation.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. Since DC(x,y), x doesn't even touch y's boundary. And since z is inside y, touching y's boundary at some points, there's no way for x and z to touch. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Since x is outside of y and z is inside y, they cannot overlap. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not a possible relation.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. Since x is outside of y and z is inside y, x cannot be a part of z. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to the above, x cannot be a part of z. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. Since z is inside y and x is outside of y, z cannot be a part of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the above, z cannot be a part of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. Since z is inside y and x is outside of y, they cannot be coincident. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Based on the above reasoning, DC(x,z) is the only possible relation between x and z.

Let me double check by considering a clear example. Imagine:
- y is a circle.
- z is a smaller circle, entirely inside y, but touching y's boundary at one point.
- x is another circle, outside of y, and not touching y.

Given this scenario, it's clear that x and z are disconnected, with y's boundary between them. This confirms that DC(x,z) is the only possible relation.

Wait, I just had a thought. What if z is a circle inside y, touching y's boundary at a point P. And what if x is also a circle, outside of y, but in a position where if y wasn't there, x would touch z at the same point P? In this case, would EC(x,z) be a possible relation? Let's examine:

If DC(x,y), then x and y don't even touch. This means x is away from y's boundary, and thus away from the point P where z touches y's boundary. Therefore, x cannot touch z at the point P or any other point. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation in this case.

I'm confident now: given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Hold on, I'm still a bit uncomfortable with my reasoning. Let me tackle it differently.

First, a potential confusion: TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y, touching y's boundary. The "i" in TPPi stands for "inverse."

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y don't touch at all.
- TPPi(y,z): z is entirely inside y, touching y's boundary at some points.

If x and y don't touch at all, and z is entirely inside y, then x and z cannot touch either. This is because z is bounded by y, and if x doesn't touch y, it can't touch z either.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z) - they are disconnected.

I'll see if I've missed anything by considering a counterexample. Suppose we claim EC(x,z) is possible, meaning x and z touch but don't overlap. For x and z to touch, they must share a boundary point. Let's call this point P. Since z is entirely inside y, P must be on y's boundary. But, if P is on y's boundary, then x would also touch y's boundary at P. This contradicts the given condition DC(x,y), which says x and y don't touch at all. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for other relations like PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ, there would be some common point or region between x and z. Since z is bounded by y, any such common point or region would imply some form of connection between x and y, which contradicts DC(x,y).

Hence, DC(x,z) is the only possible relation.

Actually, maybe I should try using a composition table directly, if I can recall the RCC-8 composition table. Let me just re-think this from scratch.

We have DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), and we want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's examine the constraints:
1. DC(x,y) means x and y are completely disconnected. They don't touch and don't overlap.
2. TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, touching y's boundary.

Given that x and y are completely disconnected, and z is entirely inside y, touching y's boundary, let's consider the possibilities for the relation between x and z:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Given that x is outside y and z is inside y, x and z are separated by y's boundary. Therefore, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

EC(x,z): x and z touch but don't overlap. For x and z to touch, they would need to share a boundary point. Since z is inside y, any boundary point of z that's also on y's boundary would be a shared point between x and z. However, since DC(x,y), x is completely disconnected from y, meaning x and y don't share any points, including boundary points. Therefore, x and z cannot share a boundary point, making EC(x,z) not a possible relation.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. For x and z to overlap, they would need to share some interior points. Since z is entirely inside y, any overlap between x and z would imply that x also has some part inside y. This contradicts DC(x,y), which states that x and y are completely disconnected. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not a possible relation.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be entirely inside z, touching z's boundary. Given that z is inside y, x would also be inside y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to the above, x would be inside y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be entirely inside x, touching x's boundary. Since z is inside y, x would need to overlap with y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the above, x would overlap with y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. For x and z to be coincident, they would occupy the exact same space. Since z is inside y, x would also be inside y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Based on the above reasoning, DC(x,z) is the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually, let me try to be even more explicit about the reasoning. I need to test whether each of the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z is consistent with the given constraints. Here's why:

DC(x,z): This is consistent because if x is outside of y and z is inside y, then x and z are disconnected. 

EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary. Since z is inside y (but touching y's boundary), any point where z touches y's boundary could potentially be a point where x touches z. However, if x and y are disconnected (DC(x,y)), then x doesn't touch y's boundary at all. So, x can't touch z at the boundary of y, which is the only place where they could potentially touch. Therefore, EC(x,z) is inconsistent with the given constraints.

PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share some interior. Since z is entirely inside y, any overlap between x and z would imply that x has some part inside y. But this contradicts DC(x,y), which says x and y are disconnected. Therefore, PO(x,z) is inconsistent.

TPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely inside z, touching z's boundary. Since z is inside y, x would also be inside y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is inconsistent.

NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary. Again, x would be inside y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is inconsistent.

TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely inside x, touching x's boundary. Since z is inside y, x would overlap with y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is inconsistent.

NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely inside x, not touching x's boundary. Again, x would overlap with y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is inconsistent.

EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. Since z is inside y, x would also be inside y, contradicting DC(x,y). Therefore, EQ(x,z) is inconsistent.

So, only DC(x,z) is consistent with the given constraints.

Just to be sure, maybe this is in the RCC-8 composition table. From the RCC-8 composition table, the entry for DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) should give us the possible relations between x and z. The composition of DC and TPPi is indeed DC. This confirms that DC(x,z) is the only possible relation.

So, given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I realized I don't have the composition table in front of me, but I still want to confirm it. Let me go with logical reasoning to confirm that DC(x,z) is the only possible relation.

Suppose, for contradiction, that the relation between x and z is not DC. Then one of the other RCC-8 relations must hold. But, as we've shown, all other RCC-8 relations are inconsistent with the given constraints. Therefore, the relation between x and z must be DC.

To double-check, let's try to construct a counterexample. If we claim that EC(x,z) is a possible relation, we would need x and z to touch at a boundary. Since z is inside y, touching y's boundary, x would need to touch y's boundary at the same point. But this contradicts DC(x,y). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for other relations like PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ, we can construct similar contradictions.

I'm confident that the answer is DC(x,z).

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They don't overlap and don't touch.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y, touching y's boundary.

The only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let's understand what these relations tell us:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y and touches y's boundary

Given these conditions:
- x is completely outside of y (they don't even touch)
- z is completely inside y (but touches y's boundary)

Let me analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Since x is outside of y and z is inside y, they must be disconnected with y's boundary separating them. Even at points where z touches y's boundary, x cannot be there (since DC(x,y) means x doesn't touch y at all).

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because x and z would need to share a boundary point, but since z only touches y's boundary and x is disconnected from y, they cannot touch.

3. PO(x,z): Not possible because x and z cannot overlap since z is inside y while x is outside y.

4. TPP, NTPP: Not possible because x cannot be inside z (as z is inside y and x is outside y).

5. TPPi, NTPPi: Not possible because z cannot be inside x (as z is inside y and x is outside y).

6. EQ(x,z): Not possible because x and z cannot be coincident (as z is inside y and x is outside y).

### Answer: DC(x,z)
