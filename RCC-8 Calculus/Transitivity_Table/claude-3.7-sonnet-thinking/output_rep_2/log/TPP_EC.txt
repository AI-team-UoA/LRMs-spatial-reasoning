PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Okay, so I have the following:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior points. They are externally connected.

Now, I need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z given these constraints. Let's think about this systematically.

Given TPP(x,y):
- x is inside y
- x touches y's boundary at some point(s)

Given EC(y,z):
- y and z touch at a boundary
- y and z don't share interior points

Now, for the relationship between x and z, let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   If x is inside y but doesn't touch the specific part of y's boundary that touches z, then x and z would be disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   If x touches y's boundary at exactly where y touches z, then x and z would touch at a boundary point but not share interior points. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Given that y and z don't share interior points (EC(y,z)), and x is wholly within y (TPP(x,y)), x cannot share interior points with z. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Given that x is within y (TPP(x,y)) and y doesn't share interior points with z (EC(y,z)), x cannot be inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, given the constraints, x cannot be inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Since x is within y (TPP(x,y)) and y merely touches z at a boundary (EC(y,z)), z cannot be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, z cannot be inside x given the constraints. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   This means x and z are the same region. Given that x is a proper part of y and y doesn't share interior points with z, x cannot be equal to z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, I want to double-check this by thinking more carefully. 

Let's think about the constraints more closely. 

TPP(x,y) means x is inside y and touches y's boundary. So x occupies a region inside y, possibly touching parts of y's boundary.

EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. Now, let's think about where x could be in relation to this boundary between y and z.

1. x could be inside y without touching the specific part of y's boundary that touches z. In this case, x and z would be disconnected, so DC(x,z).

2. x could touch the specific part of y's boundary that touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary, so EC(x,z).

3. What about other possibilities? x is wholly within y, and y and z don't share interior points. So, x and z don't share interior points either. This rules out PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I'll answer with:

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to analyze what these constraints tell us:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points)

Given these constraints, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This occurs when x is inside y but doesn't touch the specific part of y's boundary that connects with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This occurs when x touches the exact part of y's boundary that connects with z, making x and z touch at a boundary point.

No other relations are possible because:
- x cannot overlap with z's interior (ruling out PO, TPP, NTPP)
- z cannot be part of x (ruling out TPPi, NTPPi)
- x and z cannot be equal (ruling out EQ)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
