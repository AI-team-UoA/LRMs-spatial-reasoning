PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We are given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z inverse, which means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

So we have:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- z is part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Now I need to determine all possible relationships between x and z. Let's go through the RCC-8 relations one by one:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: 
   Since both x and z are parts of y, they must be within y's boundaries. However, they could still be disconnected from each other within y.
   This is possible if x and z don't overlap or touch within y.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
   Since z is completely inside y (not touching y's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, they could potentially just touch at their boundaries.
   This is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   This means x and z share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
   This is possible if x and z overlap partially within y.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
   Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, if x is part of z, x would have to touch z's boundary.
   This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   This is not possible because x touches y's boundary, and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary. So x cannot be completely inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse:
   This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
   Since z doesn't touch y's boundary and is completely inside y, and x touches y's boundary, it's possible that z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary (but not y's boundary).
   This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse:
   This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, it could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
   This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   This means x and z are the same region.
   This is not possible because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't.

Wait, I need to be a bit more careful here. Let me reconsider some of these.

Let's be precise about the definitions:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, so z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's think about what these mean for the relationship between x and z:

- x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
   For this to be true, x and z would need to have no common points. Given that both are within y, this is possible if they're in different parts of y with no overlap or contact.
   This is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   For this to be true, x and z would need to touch at their boundaries but have no common interior points. This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries within y.
   This is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   For this to be true, x and z would need to have some common interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Given their positions within y, this is possible.
   This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. 
   Wait. Given that x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, if x were inside z, then z would also touch y's boundary through x, which contradicts our initial assumption. So this is not possible.
   Actually, this isn't right. x could be tangential to z, even if x is also tangential to y, and z is not tangential to y. The way to picture this is that z is completely inside y, and x is inside both y and z, but x touches the boundary of both y and z. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
   But if x touches y's boundary and is completely inside z, then z would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts our initial assumption. So this is not possible.
   Actually, I see I previously made a logical mistake here. x touches y's boundary so it's not completely inside z if z doesn't touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse:
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Given that z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is inside y and touches y's boundary, it's possible for z to be inside x and touch x's boundary (not y's).
   This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse:
   For this to be true, z would need to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given their positions within y, this is possible.
   This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   For this to be true, x and z would need to be the same region.
   But x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be the same. This is not possible.

Let me reconsider TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) since I'm not fully convinced of my logic.

For TPP(x,z):
- x is a tangential proper part of z: x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- Given that x touches y's boundary and z is inside y without touching y's boundary, is it possible for x to be inside z?

Actually, no. If x touches y's boundary and is inside z, then z must also touch y's boundary (through x). But we are given that z doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, wait, I'm being sloppy. Let me re-read the definitions.

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is entirely contained within y, and x ≠ y) and x touches the boundary of y.

NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which is NTPP(z,y). So NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y (i.e., z is entirely contained within y, and z ≠ y) and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given these definitions, we have:
- x is entirely contained within y and touches the boundary of y.
- z is entirely contained within y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
   For this to be true, x and z would need to have no common points. Given that both are within y, this is possible if they're in different parts of y.
   This is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   For this to be true, x and z would need to touch at their boundaries but have no common interior points. This is possible.
   This is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   For this to be true, x and z would need to have some common interior points, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible.
   This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   For this to be true, x would need to be entirely contained within z and touch the boundary of z. Given that x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, is this possible?

   Actually, I think I was mistaken before. The fact that x touches the boundary of y doesn't mean it can't be inside z. It just means that if x is inside z, then x must touch z's boundary at the point where x touches y's boundary.

   However, if x is entirely contained within z and touches the boundary of y, then z must contain the point where x touches y's boundary. But since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, this is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   For this to be true, x would need to be entirely contained within z and not touch the boundary of z. But if x touches the boundary of y and is inside z, then z must also touch the boundary of y, which contradicts our given NTPPi(y,z).
   This is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse:
   For this to be true, z would need to be entirely contained within x and touch the boundary of x. Given that z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, it could be inside x and touch the boundary of x (but not y's boundary).
   This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse:
   For this to be true, z would need to be entirely contained within x and not touch the boundary of x. This is possible.
   This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   For this to be true, x and z would need to be the same region. But since x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't, they can't be the same.
   This is not possible.

Let me just double-check if TPP(x,z) is really impossible.

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is a proper part of z (contained within z and not equal to z) and x touches the boundary of z.

We are given that:
- x is a tangential proper part of y.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't touch the boundary of y. If x is inside z, it would touch the boundary of z, but it wouldn't be possible for x to also touch the boundary of y unless z also touched the boundary of y. But we're told that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning it doesn't touch the boundary of y. So there's a contradiction, and TPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, actually, I'm having second thoughts about TPP(x,z) because I'm not completely sure if my reasoning is correct. Let me come up with a geometric example to solidify my understanding.

Let's say that y is the unit circle. x is the closed unit semicircle for the top half of the circle. So TPP(x,y) because x is a proper part of y and it touches the boundary of y (actually, x includes part of the boundary of y).

Now, let's say that z is the open bottom quarter of the unit circle. So NTPPi(y,z), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

What is the relationship between x and z? Well, they don't overlap, they don't touch, so they are disconnected. So in this case, DC(x,z) is the relationship.

OK let's try another example.

Let y be the unit circle. Let x be the closed top half of the unit circle. Then TPP(x,y).

Let z be the open unit circle with radius 0.9 centered at the origin. Then NTPPi(y,z) because z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

What is the relationship between x and z? x and z have a non-empty intersection, but neither is contained in the other. So they are partially overlapping. So PO(x,z).

Let's try a third example.

Let y be the unit circle. Let z be a small open circle near the bottom of y, so that NTPPi(y,z). Let x be the closure of (y - z). So x is y with z removed. Then TPP(x,y), because x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.

What is the relationship between x and z? they touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. So EC(x,z).

Let's try a fourth example.

Let y be the unit circle. Let x be a shape that comprises the top half of the unit circle, together with a small bump that goes into the bottom half. That is, x consists of the top half of the unit circle, plus a small piece of the bottom half.

Let z be a small open circle contained in the part of x that goes into the bottom half of y. 

Then TPP(x,y) because x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y. And NTPPi(y,z) because z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

What is the relationship between x and z? z is a part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z).

Let's try one more example.

Let y be the unit circle. Let x be a shape that comprises the top half of the unit circle, together with a small bump that goes into the bottom half. That is, x consists of the top half of the unit circle, plus a small piece of the bottom half.

Let z be an open circle that contains the small bump of x, but doesn't contain any of the top half of x, and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Then TPP(x,y) because x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y. And NTPPi(y,z) because z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

What is the relationship between x and z? A part of x (the small bump) is contained in z, and a part of x (the top half) is outside of z. So x and z partially overlap. So PO(x,z).

Actually, I realize that I can't come up with an example for TPPi(x,z). Let's see if I can disprove it.

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is a proper part of x (contained within x and not equal to x) and z touches the boundary of x.

We are given that:
- x is a tangential proper part of y.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y. If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z touches the boundary of x, but doesn't touch the boundary of y. This boundary can't be the outer boundary of x, because that's the boundary of y. So it must be an inner boundary.

By an inner boundary, I mean that x must have a "hole" and z touches the boundary of the hole.

Let's construct an example for TPPi(x,z):

Let y be the unit circle. Let x be the unit circle with a small open circle removed from the bottom half. The removed circle doesn't touch the boundary of y. Let z be a slightly smaller closed circle that fits inside the hole in x but touches the boundary of the hole. I don't think this construction works.

Actually let me draw a picture to make sure I am thinking of the right thing. Let y be the unit circle.

Let x be the unit circle with a hole in the bottom half. Specifically, x = y - B, where B is a small open circle in the bottom half of y.

So TPP(x,y) because x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y. In fact, x contains most of the boundary of y.

Let z be a small closed circle in the bottom part of y, not touching the boundary of y. Crucially, z doesn't fully fit within the hole B. Specifically, z partially overlaps with B and also with region y - B = x. So z partially overlaps with x: z is partially outside of x, and partially inside x. So z is not a proper part of x.

So TPPi(x,z) is not the relation.

Maybe we can do this more precisely. If TPPi(x,z), then z must be a proper part of x. So z is a subset of x, and z doesn't equal x. But then z is a subset of y, and z doesn't equal y.

Also, if TPPi(x,z), then z must touch the boundary of x. But there are two boundaries: the outer boundary of x, which is the same as the boundary of y; and possibly an inner boundary, if x has a hole. If z touches the outer boundary, then z touches the boundary of y, which contradicts our assumption that NTPPi(y,z). If z touches an inner boundary, then it's touching the boundary of a hole in x. But then z would not be a proper part of x, it would partially overlap with x.

So it looks like TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me just re-do my reasoning on TPPi(x,z) to be really sure.

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is a proper part of x (contained within x and not equal to x) and z touches the boundary of x.

We are given that:
- x is a tangential proper part of y.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Does the fact that TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) allow for the possibility that TPPi(x,z)? I'm still not 100% convinced about my reasoning.

Actually, I think I previously was overthinking it. Let's visualize this:

Let's say y is the unit circle, and z is a small open circle completely inside y, not touching the boundary of y. So NTPPi(y,z).

Now, let's say x is a region inside y that touches the boundary of y, so TPP(x,y).

Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z))? This would mean that z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x.

If z is completely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, and z touches the boundary of x, then x must have a boundary that's inside y. This is possible if x has a "hole" or an inner boundary.

So, if x is the unit circle with a small hole inside, and z is a small circle that fits inside x and touches the boundary of the hole, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

But wait, actually, the definition of TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, which means TPP(z,x). This means that z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.

If z is a proper part of x, then z is completely inside x. If z is also a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPPi(y,z)), then z is completely inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, if z touches the boundary of x and is completely inside x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y, then the boundary of x that z touches must be an internal boundary of x. That is possible if x has a hole.

Hang on, I think I'm being sloppy again. Let's be really explicit about the definitions and get to the bottom of this.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y: x is contained within y and doesn't equal y.
- x touches the boundary of y.

NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means:
- z is a proper part of y: z is contained within y and doesn't equal y.
- z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

TPPi(x,z) means that TPP(z,x), which means:
- z is a proper part of x: z is contained within x and doesn't equal x.
- z touches the boundary of x.

So, can TPPi(x,z) be true given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z)?

If z is inside x, it might touch a boundary of x. But does this have to be the outer boundary of x (i.e., the part of the boundary of x that also forms a boundary with y) or could it be an inner boundary of x?

If it's the outer boundary, then z would also be touching the boundary of y, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z).

But z could be touching an inner boundary of x. This is possible if x has a "hole" inside.

Let me try to be more formally rigorous.

The boundary of a set x is the set of points that are in neither the interior of x nor the interior of its complement. Let me call this boundary bd(x).

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y.
- There exists a point p such that p is in both the boundary of x and the boundary of y. That is, there exists a p in bd(x) ∩ bd(y).

NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means:
- z is a proper part of y.
- There does not exist a point p such that p is in both the boundary of z and the boundary of y. That is, bd(z) ∩ bd(y) = ∅.

TPPi(x,z) means that TPP(z,x), which means:
- z is a proper part of x.
- There exists a point p such that p is in both the boundary of z and the boundary of x. That is, there exists a p in bd(z) ∩ bd(x).

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), can TPPi(x,z) be true?

TPP(x,y) tells us that there exists a point p1 in bd(x) ∩ bd(y).
NTPPi(y,z) tells us that bd(z) ∩ bd(y) = ∅.
TPPi(x,z) requires that there exists a point p2 in bd(z) ∩ bd(x).

For p2 to exist, it must be in the boundary of z and the boundary of x. It can't be in the boundary of y, because NTPPi(y,z) tells us that the boundary of z and the boundary of y have no points in common.

So p2 must be in bd(z) ∩ bd(x) but not in bd(y). What does the boundary of x look like? Some points of the boundary of x are also in the boundary of y (like p1), and some might not be. If there's a part of the boundary of x that's not in the boundary of y, then this part is inside y.

Thus, at least some of the boundary of x that doesn't overlap with the boundary of y must be reachable from the outside of x and the inside of y. In other words, there must be a "hole" in x, and z can touch the boundary of this hole.

So, if x has a "hole" inside, and z is a region that touches the boundary of this hole, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me try to create a specific example to confirm this.

Let y be the unit circle. Let x be the unit circle with a small open circle B removed from the interior, not touching the boundary of y. So TPP(x,y) because x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y. In fact, x contains most of the boundary of y. 

Let z be a closed circle contained within y, not touching the boundary of y, but touching the inner boundary of x (the boundary of the hole B). So NTPPi(y,z) because z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

What's the relationship between x and z? z is not a subset of x because part of z extends into the hole B that we removed from x. So TPPi(x,z) is false. This example doesn't work to show TPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I need to rethink the example.

Let y be the unit circle. Let x be the unit circle with a small open circle B removed from the interior, not touching the boundary of y. So TPP(x,y) because x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y. In fact, x contains most of the boundary of y.

Let z be a closed circle fully contained within x, not touching the boundary of y, but touching the inner boundary of x (the boundary of the hole B). So NTPPi(y,z) because z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

What's the relationship between x and z? Now z is a subset of x and touches the inner boundary of x, i.e. the boundary of the hole B. So TPPi(x,z) is true!

Actually, I think Imade a typo. I should have been writing TPP(z,x) for that last reasoning. But in any case, this example shows that TPPi(x,z) is possible.

OK so I'm convinced now that TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship. Let's go back and reconsider all the relations.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me reconsider each of these relations once more to make sure we're on the right track, based on the strict definitions of the relations.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y (x is contained within y and doesn't equal y) and x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y (z is contained within y and doesn't equal y) and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Now, let's consider the different possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: x and z have no common points. Given that both are within y, this is possible if they're in different parts of y. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: x and z touch at their boundaries but have no common interior points. This is possible. For example, x can be a region inside y that touches the boundary of y, and z can be a region fully inside y, not touching the boundary of y, but touching the boundary of x.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: x and z have some common interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Given their positions within y, this is possible. For example, y is the unit circle, x is the top half of y, z is a small circle in the middle of y that partially intersects with x.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. We've established that this is not possible. If x is a subset of z and touches the boundary of y, then z would have to touch the boundary of y, which contradicts our assumption that NTPPi(y,z). On the other hand, if z is fully contained in y and doesn't touch the boundary of y, x cannot touch the boundary of y if it is contained fully in z. So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z). If x touches the boundary of y, and x is fully contained in z, then z must also touch the boundary of y. But this contradicts our assumption that z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - tangential proper part inverse: z is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. We've established that this is possible. If x has a "hole" inside, z can be a region that touches the inner boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - non-tangential proper part inverse: z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible. If z is fully contained within x and doesn't touch either the outer boundary of x (which overlaps with the boundary of y) or any inner boundary of x (if x has holes), then NTPPi(x,z) holds.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: x and z are the same region. This is not possible because x touches the boundary of y and z doesn't. So they can't be equal.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

So the answer is DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let's understand what these relations mean:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Possible. Both x and z can be separate regions within y.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Possible. x and z can partially overlap within y.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x touches y's boundary and is contained in z, then z would also touch y's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as above.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x and touch an inner boundary of x (if x has a "hole").

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching any boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. x touches y's boundary while z doesn't, so they can't be equal.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
