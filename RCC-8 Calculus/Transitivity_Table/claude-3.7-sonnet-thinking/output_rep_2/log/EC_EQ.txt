PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step.

We have:
- EC(x,y), which means that x and y touch at their boundary but do not share interior parts.
- EQ(y,z), which means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.

Now, we need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are essentially the same region. This means that any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. 

Given that EC(x,y), and since y and z are equivalent (EQ(y,z)), it follows that x and z must also be externally connected.

So, the relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Actually, let me check that this is correct. If y and z are the same spatial region, then the boundary of y is the same as the boundary of z. Since x touches the boundary of y (due to EC(x,y)), it also touches the boundary of z.

Additionally, x and y don't share any interior parts, which means x and z also don't share any interior parts (since z and y are the same).

Therefore, x and z must indeed be externally connected, i.e., EC(x,z).

To summarize, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

Based on the RCC-8 calculus relations:

1. EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
2. EQ(y,z) means y and z occupy exactly the same spatial region

Since y and z are identical spatial regions (EQ(y,z)), any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Because x is externally connected to y, and z is identical to y, x must also be externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
