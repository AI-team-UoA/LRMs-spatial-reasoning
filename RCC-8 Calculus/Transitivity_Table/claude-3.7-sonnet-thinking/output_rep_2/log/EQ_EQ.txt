PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's consider the RCC-8 calculus relations:

1. DC(x,y) - x and y are disconnected
2. EC(x,y) - x and y are externally connected (touch at boundary)
3. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap
4. TPP(x,y) - x is a tangential proper part of y
5. NTPP(x,y) - x is a non-tangential proper part of y
6. TPPi(x,y) - y is a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,y) - y is a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,y) - x and y are equal/coincident

Now let's analyze the situation:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident/equal
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident/equal

If x equals y, and y equals z, then by the transitive property of equality, x must equal z.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is:
EQ(x,z)

This is a basic property of equality - if x = y and y = z, then x = z.

ANSWER:

If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident/equal.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident/equal.

Equality is transitive, meaning if x equals y and y equals z, then x must equal z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
