PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We're given that:
1. TPPi(x,y): This means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is contained in the other.

Now let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's visualize the situation: 
- We have x which contains y as a tangential proper part (TPPi(x,y)).
- We have z which partially overlaps with y (PO(y,z)).

Given these constraints, what are the possible relations between x and z?

Since y is properly contained in x and z overlaps with y, we know that z at least shares some part with x (through y). So z and x must share some spatial part. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) as possible relations.

What about the other relations?

1. PO(x,z): This is possible if z extends beyond x in some areas and x extends beyond z in other areas.
2. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z contains x and touches x's boundary.
3. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z completely contains x without touching x's boundary.
4. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x contains z and z touches x's boundary.
5. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if x completely contains z without z touching x's boundary.
6. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z coincide. This is possible if x and z are the same region.

Let's analyze each case more carefully:

For PO(x,z):
- y is part of x.
- y partially overlaps with z.
- This means there's a part of y (and hence a part of x) that's also a part of z.
- But since y only partially overlaps with z, there's a part of z that's outside of y.
- This part of z could be inside x or outside of x.
- If there's a part of z that's outside of x, then x and z would be in the PO relation.
So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

For TPP(x,z):
- y is part of x.
- y partially overlaps with z.
- If x is a tangential proper part of z, then all of x (including y) would be inside z. But this would mean that y is fully inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).
So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Wait, that's not quite right. In PO(y,z), y partially overlaps with z, but neither is fully contained in the other. This means there's a part of y outside of z. 

Let me try again for TPP(x,z):
- y is tangentially contained in x (i.e., y touches the boundary of x).
- y partially overlaps with z. This means there's a part of y inside z and a part of y outside of z.
- If x is a tangential proper part of z, then all of x would be inside z. But this would mean that all parts of y are inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).
So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

For NTPP(x,z):
- y is tangentially contained in x.
- y partially overlaps with z.
- If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then all of x (including y) would be inside z without touching z's boundary. But this would mean that y is fully inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).
So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

For TPPi(x,z):
- y is tangentially contained in x.
- y partially overlaps with z.
- If z is a tangential proper part of x, then all of z would be inside x, and z would touch the boundary of x.
- This is consistent with our constraints: y is inside x and partially overlaps with z, and all of z is inside x.
So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- y is tangentially contained in x.
- y partially overlaps with z.
- If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then all of z would be inside x without touching x's boundary.
- This is consistent with our constraints: y is inside x and partially overlaps with z, and all of z is inside x.
So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

Actually, I need to be more careful here in the TPPi and NTPPi cases. Let's check them more carefully.

For TPPi(x,z):
- We know that TPPi(x,y), meaning y is tangentially contained in x.
- We know that PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap.
- For TPPi(x,z), we'd need z to be tangentially contained in x. This means all of z is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x.
- Given that z partially overlaps with y, there's a part of z that's inside y and a part of z that's outside of y. The part of z that's outside of y can still be inside x, making TPPi(x,z) possible.
But there's an additional constraint: z must touch the boundary of x. This can happen if the part of z that's outside of y extends to the boundary of x.
So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- We know that TPPi(x,y), meaning y is tangentially contained in x.
- We know that PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap.
- For NTPPi(x,z), we'd need z to be non-tangentially contained in x. This means all of z is inside x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- Given that z partially overlaps with y, there's a part of z that's inside y and a part of z that's outside of y. The part of z that's outside of y can still be inside x.
- For z to be non-tangentially contained in x, the part of z that's outside of y must not touch the boundary of x.
So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

For EQ(x,z):
- We know that TPPi(x,y), meaning y is tangentially contained in x.
- We know that PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap.
- For EQ(x,z), we'd need x and z to be identical. If x and z are identical, then y would be tangentially contained in z. But this contradicts the fact that PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap, not one being contained in the other.
So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

BUT WAIT a minute, let me draw this to make sure.

We have TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z). That means:
- y is tangentially inside x
- y and z have an overlapping part, but y has a part outside z and z has a part outside y

Since y is inside x, the part of y that overlaps with z is also inside x. This means x and z share a common part, which rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Let's consider each remaining relation:

PO(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must share a common part, and there must be a part of x outside z and a part of z outside x.
- We know they share a common part because y (which is inside x) partially overlaps with z.
- Since y is inside x but partially outside z, there's a part of x outside z.
- For there to be a part of z outside x, the part of z that doesn't overlap with y must extend beyond x.
So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be properly inside z and touch z's boundary.
- Since y is properly inside x and y is partially outside z, there's a part of x outside z.
- This contradicts the requirement for TPP(x,z) that all of x is inside z.
So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this requires all of x to be inside z, which contradicts our observations.
So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be properly inside x and touch x's boundary.
- We know y is inside x and partially overlaps with z. The part of z that overlaps with y is inside x.
- The part of z that doesn't overlap with y can be inside x, touching the boundary of x.
So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

NTPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- The part of z that overlaps with y is inside x.
- The part of z that doesn't overlap with y can be entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x.
So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z must be identical.
- Since y is properly inside x and partially overlaps with z, x and z cannot be identical.
So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

But I need to double check my reasoning for TPPi and NTPPi more carefully, because I need to make sure I consider all constraints correctly.

For TPPi(x,z):
- We know that TPPi(x,y), meaning y is tangentially contained in x.
- We know that PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap.
- For TPPi(x,z), we'd need z to be tangentially contained in x. This means all of z is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x.
- Given that z partially overlaps with y, there's a part of z that's inside y and a part of z that's outside of y. The part of z that's outside of y can be inside x.
- For TPPi(x,z) to be true, all of z must be inside x, and z must touch the boundary of x.
This is certainly possible. For example, z could be a region that partially overlaps with y, and the part of z that doesn't overlap with y extends to the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- We know that TPPi(x,y), meaning y is tangentially contained in x.
- We know that PO(y,z), meaning y and z partially overlap.
- For NTPPi(x,z), we'd need z to be non-tangentially contained in x. This means all of z is inside x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- Given that z partially overlaps with y, there's a part of z that's inside y and a part of z that's outside of y. The part of z that's outside of y can be inside x.
- For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, all of z must be inside x, and z must not touch the boundary of x.
This is also possible. For example, z could be a region that partially overlaps with y, and the part of z that doesn't overlap with y is still contained within x without reaching the boundary of x.

Wait, I'm forgetting another possibility. When y and z partially overlap (PO(y,z)), there's a part of z that overlaps with y, and there's a part of z that's outside of y. But there's also a part of y that's outside of z.

We know that y is tangentially contained in x (TPPi(x,y)). This means all of y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.

Given that a part of y is outside of z and all of y is inside x, there's a part of x (specifically, a part of y) that's outside of z. This rules out the possibility that all of x is inside z, so TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

OK, let me draw the pictures.

We have TPPi(x,y) which means that y is a part of x and touches its boundary.

We have PO(y,z) which means that y and z overlap, but neither is a part of the other.

First PO(x,z): This is possible if z extends beyond x in some areas. For example:

```
   +--------------------+
   |                    |
   |         x          |
   |  +----+            |
   |  |    |            |
   |  |  y |            |
   |  +----+--+         |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   +-----|---+          |
         |  z           |
         |              |
         +--------------+
```

In this picture, y is inside x and touches its boundary (TPPi(x, y)).
And y and z partially overlap, with parts of each outside the other (PO(y,z)).
And x and z partially overlap, with parts of each outside the other (PO(x,z)).

Next TPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is inside x and touches its boundary.

```
   +--------------------+
   |                    |
   |         x          |
   |  +----+            |
   |  |    |            |
   |  |  y |            |
   |  +----+--+         |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |  z           |
   |     |              |
   +-----+--------------+
```

In this picture, y is inside x and touches its boundary (TPPi(x, y)).
And y and z partially overlap, with parts of each outside the other (PO(y,z)).
And z is inside x and touches its boundary (TPPi(x,z)).

Next, NTPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is inside x and doesn't touch its boundary.

```
   +--------------------+
   |                    |
   |         x          |
   |  +----+            |
   |  |    |            |
   |  |  y |            |
   |  +----+--+         |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |  z           |
   |     |              |
   +-----+--------------+
```

Wait, that diagram doesn't show the distinction clearly because I drew the diagrams the same. Let me try again for NTPPi(x,z):

```
   +--------------------+
   |                    |
   |         x          |
   |  +----+            |
   |  |    |            |
   |  |  y |            |
   |  +----+--+         |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |  z           |
   |     |              |
   +-----+--------------+
```

I see that my diagram is still not showing the distinction well. The point is that for NTPPi(x,z), z would be fully inside x without touching x's boundary, but still partially overlapping with y.

So let me try once more with a bit more care:

For TPPi(x,z):

```
   +--------------------+
   |                    |
   |         x          |
   |  +----+            |
   |  |    |            |
   |  |  y |            |
   |  +----+--+         |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |  z           |
   |     |              |
   +-----+--------------+
```

In this picture, z touches the boundary of x, which makes it TPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z):

```
   +--------------------+
   |                    |
   |         x          |
   |  +----+            |
   |  |    |            |
   |  |  y |            |
   |  +----+--+         |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     |   |          |
   |     +---+          |
   |                    |
   |                    |
   +--------------------+
```

In this picture, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which makes it NTPPi(x,z).

But these pictures are not very precise. Let me think more abstractly.

We have TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z). That means:
- y is tangentially inside x
- y and z have an overlapping part, but y has a part outside z and z has a part outside y

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share a common part, and there must be a part of x outside z and a part of z outside x.
- We know they share a common part because y (which is inside x) partially overlaps with z.
- Since y is inside x but has a part outside z, there's a part of x outside z.
- For there to be a part of z outside x, the part of z that doesn't overlap with y must extend beyond x's boundary.
So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be properly inside x and touch x's boundary.
- We know y is inside x and partially overlaps with z.
- For TPPi(x,z) to be true, all of z must be inside x, and z must touch the boundary of x.
This is possible, for example, if the part of z that doesn't overlap with y is still inside x and touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- We know y is inside x and partially overlaps with z.
- For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, all of z must be inside x, and z must not touch the boundary of x.
This is possible, for example, if the part of z that doesn't overlap with y is inside x without reaching the boundary of x.

Let's consider EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. If they were identical, then y would be tangentially inside z (because y is tangentially inside x). But this contradicts the fact that PO(y,z), which means y and z partially overlap. In a partial overlap, neither region is inside the other. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Let's consider TPP(x,z): This would mean x is tangentially inside z. If that were the case, all of x (including y) would be inside z. But this contradicts the fact that PO(y,z), which implies that a part of y (and hence a part of x) is outside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Let's consider NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is non-tangentially inside z. If that were the case, all of x (including y) would be inside z. But this again contradicts the fact that PO(y,z), which implies that a part of y (and hence a part of x) is outside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Let's consider DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. If that were the case, there would be no common part between x and z. But since y is inside x and PO(y,z), there's a common part between y and z, which means there's a common part between x and z. So, DC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Let's consider EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. But since y is inside x and PO(y,z), there's a common interior part between y and z, which means there's a common interior part between x and z. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relation.

OK I think my final conclusion is that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me just double check by trying to reason through counterexamples:

- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- PO(y,z) means y and z share a common part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

For PO(x,z), we need x and z to share a common part, and there must be a part of x outside z and a part of z outside x. Since y is inside x and partially overlaps with z, x and z do share a common part. Since y has a part outside z, there's a part of x outside z. And if z extends beyond x in some areas, there's a part of z outside x. This is consistent with our constraints, so PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z), we need z to be a tangential proper part of x. This means all of z is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x. Given that y is inside x and partially overlaps with z, all of z can be inside x, and z can touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with our constraints, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), we need z to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means all of z is inside x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Given that y is inside x and partially overlaps with z, all of z can be inside x, and z can be positioned such that it doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with our constraints, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For DC(x,z), we need x and z to be disconnected. But since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z share a common part, so they're not disconnected. This is inconsistent with our constraints, so DC(x,z) is impossible.

For EC(x,z), we need x and z to touch at a boundary without sharing an interior. But since y is inside x and y shares an interior with z, x and z share an interior, so they don't just touch at a boundary. This is inconsistent with our constraints, so EC(x,z) is impossible.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be a tangential proper part of z. This means all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z. But since y is inside x and y has a part outside z, there's a part of x outside z. This is inconsistent with our constraints, so TPP(x,z) is impossible.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be a non-tangential proper part of z. This means all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. But again, since y is inside x and y has a part outside z, there's a part of x outside z. This is inconsistent with our constraints, so NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

For EQ(x,z), we need x and z to be identical. If x and z are identical, then y would be a part of z. But since PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (neither is contained in the other), y is not a part of z. This is inconsistent with our constraints, so EQ(x,z) is impossible.

I confirm my final conclusion: the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's just think carefully about the EC relation (external connection) once more.

For EC(x,z), x and z would only touch at a boundary without sharing any interior parts. 

We know that TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

We also know that PO(y,z), which means y and z share a common interior part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Since y is inside x and y shares an interior part with z, x also shares an interior part with z. This rules out the possibility of EC(x,z), where x and z would only touch at a boundary.

I think I've ruled out EC(x,z) confidently.

I've verified all the potential relations, and the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to analyze what relationships are possible between x and z given the constraints.

First, let me understand what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (they share some part, but neither is contained in the other)

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

DC(x,z): Impossible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share a part.

EC(x,z): Impossible. Since y is inside x and y shares interior points with z, x and z must share interior points.

PO(x,z): Possible. Since y is inside x and partially overlaps with z, x and z share parts. Since y has parts outside z, x has parts outside z. And z can extend beyond x's boundary in some areas.

TPP(x,z): Impossible. This would require all of x to be inside z, but since y is in x and y has parts outside z, x must have parts outside z.

NTPP(x,z): Impossible. For the same reason as TPP.

TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be properly contained in x and touch x's boundary while still partially overlapping with y.

NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary while partially overlapping with y.

EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x equals z, then y would be inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
