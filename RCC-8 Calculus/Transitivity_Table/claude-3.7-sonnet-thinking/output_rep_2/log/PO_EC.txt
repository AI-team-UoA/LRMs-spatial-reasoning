PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think carefully about this. We know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, meaning they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

We need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z. Let's consider each of the eight RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident.

Let's analyze which of these are possible given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let's think about what PO(x,y) tells us:
- x and y share some common region
- There are parts of x that are not in y
- There are parts of y that are not in x

And EC(y,z) tells us:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share any interior parts

Now, let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z:

Since y and z don't share interior parts (they only touch at boundaries), and x shares interior parts with y, there could be parts of x that don't interact with z at all. Also, since parts of y aren't in x, and z touches y at the boundary, x might not interact with z at all.

Let's go through each relation:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't extend to y's boundary where y touches z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y extends exactly to the boundary where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z): This seems unlikely since y and z don't share interior parts, and the overlap between x and y is in the interior. However, if x extends beyond y in such a way that it overlaps with z independently of its overlap with y, then PO(x,z) could be possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This seems unlikely because it would require x to be completely contained within z, which doesn't follow directly from our givens.

5. NTPP(x,z): Even less likely than TPP for the same reason.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is small and touches y at a boundary that falls within the region where x and y overlap.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. This seems unlikely given our constraints.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same, which doesn't follow from our givens.

Let me reconsider more carefully by thinking about specific examples:

Imagine a scenario where:
- y is a circle in the middle
- x is a circle that partially overlaps with y on the left side
- z is a circle that touches y on the right side

In this case, x and z would be DC (disconnected).

Now imagine:
- y is a circle in the middle
- x is a circle that partially overlaps with y
- The overlap extends to the right edge of y
- z is a circle that touches y on that same right edge

In this case, x and z would be EC (externally connected).

What about PO? Let's see:
- y is a circle in the middle
- x is a circle that partially overlaps with y on the right side
- z is a rectangle that touches y on the right edge
- z extends significantly to the right
- x also extends significantly to the right, overlapping with z

In this case, x and z would be PO (partially overlapping).

For TPP or TPPi, I need to construct special cases:
- y is a crescent shape
- x is a small circle that sits in the concave part of the crescent, partially overlapping y
- z is a large circle that surrounds x entirely and touches y at the tips of the crescent

In this case, x would be TPP in relation to z.

Let me continue with similar thought experiments for each relation... Actually, I think I can be more systematic.

Let's denote regions as sets and use set operations to reason about these relations.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x ∩ y ≠ ∅, x ⊈ y, y ⊈ x
- EC(y,z): The boundaries of y and z touch, but their interiors don't intersect

Now for each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x ∩ z = ∅. This is certainly possible if x is contained in a part of y that doesn't touch z.

2. EC(x,z): This means the boundaries of x and z touch, but their interiors don't intersect. This can happen if x extends to the boundary of y where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z): This means x ∩ z ≠ ∅, x ⊈ z, z ⊈ x. This can happen if x extends beyond the boundary of y to overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x ⊂ z and the boundaries of x and z touch. This is possible in a very specific configuration.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x ⊂ z and the boundaries don't touch. This seems hard to achieve given the constraints.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z ⊂ x and the boundaries touch. This can happen if z is small and positioned correctly.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z ⊂ x and the boundaries don't touch. This seems hard to achieve given the constraints.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x = z. This doesn't seem plausible given our constraints.

Let me double-check some of these with concrete examples.

For NTPP(x,z): 
Let's say y is a thin ring (like a donut shape). 
- x partially overlaps with y by intersecting with a small section of the ring.
- z is a large circle that contains y (and thus contains x).
- Since x is small and only intersects a small part of y, it's possible for x to be completely inside z without touching its boundary.

This shows NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- y is a crescent shape
- z is a small circle that touches one tip of the crescent
- x is a large circle that contains z and partially overlaps with y
- If designed carefully, z could be completely inside x without touching its boundary

This shows NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z):
This seems the most challenging. If x and z are equal, and y partially overlaps with x, then y must also partially overlap with z. But we know y is externally connected to z, so they don't share interior parts. This contradiction suggests EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning:
- PO(x,y): x and y share interior parts
- EC(y,z): y and z touch only at their boundaries
- If x = z (EQ), then PO(x,y) implies PO(z,y), which contradicts EC(y,z)

So EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

To summarize the possible relationships between x and z:
- DC(x,z): Possible
- EC(x,z): Possible
- PO(x,z): Possible
- TPP(x,z): Possible
- NTPP(x,z): Possible
- TPPi(x,z): Possible
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible
- EQ(x,z): Not possible

The answer is that x and z can have any of the RCC-8 relations except for EQ (equality).

Actually, wait. Let me think more carefully about the NTPP case. I need to ensure that x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y, which is externally connected to z.

Let's consider a concrete example:
- z is a large circle
- y is a crescent shape that touches z at a single point on its boundary
- x is a small circle inside z that partially overlaps with y

The challenge is: if x partially overlaps with y, and y touches z only at a boundary point, how can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

Since y and z touch at a boundary, and x overlaps with y's interior, it's hard to see how x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. 

Actually, I think I need to revise my understanding. Let me try a different example:

- z is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle that touches z externally at a point
- x is an even smaller circle that partially overlaps with y and is positioned in such a way that it's entirely inside z

Let me visualize this:
z: a large circle
y: a smaller circle that touches z at point P
x: a tiny circle that overlaps with y but is positioned further inside z, away from P

In this case, x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) holds.

The key insight is that x doesn't have to be near the point where y and z touch; it just has to partially overlap with y somewhere, and as long as this overlap is away from the boundary of z, x can be completely inside z.

Let me now revisit the other relations to ensure my reasoning is correct.

For DC(x,z): Clearly possible if x is in a part of y that's away from where y touches z.

For EC(x,z): Also possible if x extends to the exact point where y and z touch.

For PO(x,z): This can happen if part of x extends beyond y into z, but another part of x is outside z.

For TPP(x,z): This can happen if x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary at the same point where y touches z.

For NTPP(x,z): As I just discussed, this is possible if x partially overlaps with y away from the point where y and z touch, and x is entirely within z.

For TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This seems challenging because z can't be inside y (it's externally connected to y). So for z to be inside x, x must extend beyond y.

Let me construct an example for TPPi(x,z):
- y is a large circle
- z is a tiny circle that touches y at a point P
- x is a shape that partially overlaps with y and completely surrounds z

For this to work, x must extend beyond y to encompass z, which is outside y. This is certainly possible, showing TPPi(x,z) can hold.

For NTPPi(x,z): This is even more challenging because z needs to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Let me construct an example for NTPPi(x,z):
- y is a large circle
- z is a tiny circle that touches y at a point P
- x is a shape that partially overlaps with y and completely surrounds z, with a buffer zone between z and x's boundary

Again, for this to work, x must extend beyond y to encompass z with a buffer zone. This is possible, showing NTPPi(x,z) can hold.

For EQ(x,z): As I argued before, if x = z, then PO(x,y) implies PO(z,y), which contradicts EC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

To summarize the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z):
- DC(x,z): Possible
- EC(x,z): Possible
- PO(x,z): Possible
- TPP(x,z): Possible
- NTPP(x,z): Possible
- TPPi(x,z): Possible
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible
- EQ(x,z): Not possible

So, 7 out of the 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, with the exception of EQ.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning for the EQ case one more time.

EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region.
We know PO(x,y), which means x and y share interior parts.
If x = z, then z and y must also share interior parts.
But we know EC(y,z), which means y and z only touch at their boundaries and don't share interior parts.

This is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

To finalize, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations can possibly hold between x and z given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (touch at their boundaries only)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can be located in a part of y that's away from where y touches z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can extend to exactly the point where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially extend beyond y into z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be properly inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible - if x equals z, then PO(x,y) would imply PO(z,y), contradicting EC(y,z).
