PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the given relationships:
1. PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which in turn means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Now I need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z given these constraints.

Let's think about this systematically.

Given PO(x,y):
- x and y overlap, meaning they share some spatial part.
- But neither is completely contained within the other.

Given NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y):
- z is properly inside y, not touching y's boundary.

So we have z properly inside y, and x partially overlapping with y.

There are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x overlaps with a part of y that doesn't contain z.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. This isn't possible because z doesn't touch y's boundary, so it can't touch x's boundary if x is only partially overlapping with y.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y also overlaps with z.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This seems unlikely because z is properly inside y, and x is only partially overlapping with y. If x is tangential to z, it would mean x is completely inside z, which contradicts PO(x,y).
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, this seems unlikely for the same reason as TPP(x,z).
6. TPPi(x,z), which means TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained within the part of x that overlaps with y and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z), which means NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained within the part of x that overlaps with y and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. This seems unlikely because z is properly inside y, and x is only partially overlapping with y.

However, I think I need to be more careful with this analysis. Let's go through it again, thinking more clearly about the constraints.

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y overlap.
- There exists a part of x that is not in y.
- There exists a part of y that is not in x.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means:
- z is completely inside y.
- z does not touch y's boundary.

Considering the relationship between x and z, the possible scenarios are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x overlaps with a part of y that doesn't contain z.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. This isn't possible because z doesn't touch y's boundary, which means it's surrounded by y. Since x only partially overlaps with y, it can't touch z without overlapping with it.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y also overlaps with z.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But given that x is partially outside y and z is completely inside y, x can't be completely inside z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, given that x is partially outside y and z is completely inside y, x can't be completely inside z.
6. TPPi(x,z), which means TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained within the part of x that overlaps with y and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z), which means NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely contained within the part of x that overlaps with y and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. This would mean x = z. But we know that z is completely inside y, and x is partially outside y, so x and z can't be identical.

Hmm, let me think more about the constraints on the relationships between x and z.

Given PO(x,y), there's a part of x that's outside y. Given NTPPi(y,z), z is fully inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So z is surrounded by y.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. Since z is fully inside y, and x has a part outside y, x could be positioned such that it doesn't overlap with z.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. This doesn't seem possible. Since z is non-tangential to y, it's surrounded by y. For x to touch z, it would have to penetrate through y, which would mean x and z would share some interior, contradicting EC.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. If the part of x that overlaps with y also overlaps with z, then x and z would partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But given that x has a part outside y and z is completely inside y, x can't be completely inside z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, given that x has a part outside y and z is completely inside y, x can't be completely inside z.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. z could be inside the part of x that overlaps with y and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. z could be fully inside the part of x that overlaps with y, not touching x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. This doesn't seem possible. We know z is fully inside y, but x has a part outside y, so they can't be identical.

Now, let me double-check each of these:

For DC(x,z):
- We have PO(x,y), so x overlaps with y.
- We have NTPPi(y,z), meaning z is deep inside y.
- The question is: Can x overlap with y but not overlap with z?
- Yes, this is possible. Since z doesn't fill all of y (because z is non-tangential to y), x can overlap with a part of y that doesn't contain z.

For EC(x,z):
- For x to touch z, it would need to reach z inside y.
- But if x reaches z, it would share some interior with z, which contradicts EC.
- So, EC(x,z) isn't a valid option.

For PO(x,z):
- This means x and z share some interior, but neither is contained within the other.
- Since z is within y and x overlaps with y, it's possible for x to overlap with z.
- But we also require that neither x nor z is contained within the other. We know that z is not contained in x (because it's already established that z is properly within y). And x is not contained in z if it has a part outside y (which it does due to PO(x,y)).
- So, PO(x,z) is a valid option.

For TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):
- Both of these would mean x is contained within z.
- But since z is contained within y (from NTPPi(y,z)) and x has a part outside y (from PO(x,y)), x can't be contained within z.
- So, neither TPP(x,z) nor NTPP(x,z) are valid options.

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):
- These would mean z is contained within x.
- Given that z is within y and x overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be within the part of x that overlaps with y.
- TPPi(x,z) would mean z touches the boundary of x, while NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is deep inside x.
- Both of these scenarios are possible.

For EQ(x,z):
- This would mean x and z are identical.
- But we know z is fully within y, and x has a part outside y, so they can't be identical.
- So, EQ(x,z) isn't a valid option.

Ok, let's test a third time. 

For DC(x,z):
- If z is a non-tangential proper part of y, then z is surrounded by a "buffer" of y, which separates it from the boundary of y.
- Given that x partially overlaps with y, there's a part of x outside y.
- The question is: Can the part of x that overlaps with y be disjoint from z?
- Yes, this is possible. The part of x that overlaps with y might not overlap with z at all.

For EC(x,z):
- Given that z is surrounded by a buffer of y (since it's a non-tangential proper part of y), for x to touch z, it would have to penetrate this buffer.
- If x penetrates this buffer to touch z, it would share interior points with y (due to PO(x,y)).
- But since z is inside y, if x penetrates y to touch z, it would also share interior points with z, which contradicts EC.
- So, EC(x,z) isn't a valid option.

For PO(x,z):
- This means x and z share interior points, but neither is contained within the other.
- Specifically, some part of x is in z, some part of x is not in z, some part of z is in x, and some part of z is not in x.
- Given that z is inside y and x overlaps with y, it's possible for x to overlap with z.
- The part of x that is outside y ensures that x is not contained within z.
- But to ensure that z is not contained within x, there should be a part of z that's not in x. Given that z is inside y, this is possible.
- So, PO(x,z) is a valid option.

For TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):
- Both of these would mean x is contained within z.
- But since z is contained within y (from NTPPi(y,z)) and x has a part outside y (from PO(x,y)), x can't be contained within z.
- So, neither TPP(x,z) nor NTPP(x,z) are valid options.

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):
- These would mean z is contained within x.
- Given that z is within y and x overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be within the part of x that overlaps with y. 
- But is it possible for z to be fully contained in x? Let's think. Since part of x doesn't overlap with y, and z is fully contained in y, it's clear that z isn't in this part of x. But the part of x that overlaps with y could potentially fully contain z. So it's possible for both TPPi and NTPPi.
- Let's double check TPPi(x,z). This would mean z touches the boundary of x. Since z is deep inside y (non-tangentially), and x has a part outside y, if z touches the boundary of x, it would be at a point where x's boundary is inside y. This is possible.
- Now, let's check NTPPi(x,z). This would mean z is deep inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given the constraints, this is also possible.

For EQ(x,z):
- This would mean x and z are identical.
- But we know z is fully within y, and x has a part outside y, so they can't be identical.
- So, EQ(x,z) isn't a valid option.

In summary, from the RCC-8 calculus, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) are:

1. DC(x,z): Disconnected.
2. PO(x,z): Partially overlap.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
4. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Ok, let me make a sanity check. 

I have PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then want to determine possible relationships between x and z.

I've determined that the valid relationships would be DC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPPi(x, z), and NTPPi(x, z).

Here's a visual explanation of each possibility:

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): Imagine y as a large circle. Inside y, not touching its boundary, is a smaller circle, z. Now, imagine x as a circle that overlaps with y (part inside, part outside) but doesn't overlap with z. This is a valid DC(x,z) scenario.

2. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlap): Same as before, but now x is positioned such that it overlaps with both y and z. Part of x is outside y, part of it overlaps with y but not z, and part of it overlaps with z. This is a valid PO(x,z) scenario.

3. TPPi(x,z) (z is a Tangential Proper Part of x): Imagine y as before. Inside y, not touching its boundary, is z. Now, imagine x as a circle that overlaps with y, where the part of x that's inside y completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x. This is a valid TPPi(x,z) scenario.

4. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of x): Same as before, but now z is completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x. This is a valid NTPPi(x,z) scenario.

5. EC(x,z) (Externally Connected): This isn't valid. Since z is inside y, not touching its boundary, and x overlaps with y, if x touches z, it would have to overlap with it.

6. TPP(x,z) (x is a Tangential Proper Part of z): This isn't valid. Since z is inside y and x has a part outside y, x can't be contained within z.

7. NTPP(x,z) (x is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of z): This isn't valid for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z) (Equal): This isn't valid. Since z is inside y and x has a part outside y, they can't be equal.

So, our answer is the set of four possibilities: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Actually let's be more precise about TPPi(x, z). We're saying that z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must touch the boundary of x. 

Let's re-examine the problem. We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y overlap partially.
- NTPPi(y,z), which is the same as NTPP(z,y): z is fully inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Let's consider the possibilities for the boundary of x with respect to y and z:
- Since PO(x,y), the boundary of x intersects the boundary of y.
- Given that z is fully inside y (not touching y's boundary), and if we want z to be tangential to x, then the boundary of x must extend inside y to touch z.

This is indeed possible. The boundary of x can cut through y, and a part of this boundary inside y can touch z.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Actually let's just draw a concrete case and consider it to check each possibility:

For PO(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z), or equivalently, PO(x, y) and NTPP(z, y):

1. DC(x,z): Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles, and z is a small circle completely contained inside y but away from x. In this case, x and z are disconnected.

2. PO(x,z): Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles, and z is a small circle inside y but positioned such that it partially overlaps with x. In this case, x and z are in a partial overlap relationship.

3. TPPi(x,z): Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles, and z is a small circle inside y but completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y. If z touches the boundary of x, then z is a tangential proper part of x.

4. NTPPi(x,z): Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles, and z is a small circle inside y but completely inside the part of x that overlaps with y. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just verify TPPi(x, z) mathematically. 

TPPi(x, z) means:
- z is a proper part of x: z is inside x.
- z touches the boundary of x: There's at least one point where the boundaries of z and x intersect.

Given:
- PO(x, y): x and y share a part, but neither is inside the other.
- NTPPi(y, z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z, y): z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since NTPPi(y, z), we know z is surrounded by a buffer of y. Given PO(x, y), the part of x that overlaps with y could come close to z within this buffer. It's possible for the boundary of x to touch the boundary of z inside y, thus establishing TPPi(x, z).

So, yes, TPPi(x, z) is a valid relationship given the constraints.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I messed up on TPPi(x, z). Let's review:

TPPi(x, z) means TPP(z, x), which means:
- z is a tangential proper part of x: z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

But NTPPi(y, z) means NTPP(z, y), which means:
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y: z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Is it possible for z to touch the boundary of x but not the boundary of y, given PO(x, y)? 

Let's think geometry, ignoring for a moment about RCC-8 formalism. 

We have two regions x and y, which overlap. z is a region strictly inside y, away from y's boundary. If x and y overlap, part of x is inside y. z can be inside this overlapping part, and if it is, there are several possibilities:
1. z is inside the part of x that's inside y, but doesn't touch the boundary of x.
2. z is inside the part of x that's inside y, and touches the boundary of x.
3. z is not inside x at all.
4. z overlaps with x but isn't completely inside x.

For TPPi(x, z), we need z to be completely inside x and touch the boundary of x. Is this possible while ensuring z doesn't touch the boundary of y? Yes. Even if z touches the boundary of x, it can be away from the boundary of y, because the boundary of x inside y can be separate from the boundary of y.

For TPPi(x, z), z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But not all of the boundary of x is also the boundary of y. Since PO(x, y), there's a part of the boundary of x inside y. z can touch this boundary, thus establishing TPPi(x, z), while still not touching the boundary of y (which maintains NTPPi(y, z)).

So to be clear, the boundary of x can potentially intersect with z inside y, without z reaching the boundary of y. We can create a spatial configuration where TPPi(x, z) is a valid relationship.

Let me try to draw a more concrete configuration to verify this. Imagine:
- y is a large circle.
- z is a small circle inside y, away from the boundary.
- x is an ellipse that overlaps with y. The boundary of x passes through y, and inside y, it just grazes the boundary of z.

In this configuration, we have:
- PO(x, y): x overlaps with y.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is inside y, away from its boundary.
- TPPi(x, z): z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

So, TPPi(x, z) is indeed a valid relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed: DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I should go through the process more carefully to be sure.

Given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), I want to determine the possible relationships between x and z from the RCC-8 calculus.

Let me remind myself of the definitions:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- NTPPi(y,z), which is the same as NTPP(z,y): z is strictly inside y, away from the boundary of y.

Let's go through each possible relationship between x and z and check if it's consistent with the given information:

1. DC(x,z) (x and z are disconnected):
   Given that z is strictly inside y, and x overlaps with y, x and z could be positioned such that they don't overlap. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y doesn't overlap with z.
   Example: Imagine y as a large circle, z as a small circle inside y far from the boundary of y, and x as another circle that overlaps with y but is positioned such that it doesn't overlap with z.
   Verdict: Possible.

2. EC(x,z) (x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap):
   Since z is strictly inside y, away from the boundary of y, for x to touch z, x would have to penetrate into y to reach z. But if x penetrates into y to reach z, then x and z would share interior parts, which is contrary to the definition of EC.
   Verdict: Not Possible.

3. PO(x,z) (x and z overlap but neither is part of the other):
   The part of x that overlaps with y can also overlap with z, but not completely contain z, and z doesn't completely contain x. This is a valid scenario.
   Example: Imagine y as a large circle, z as a small circle inside y away from the boundary of y, and x as another circle that overlaps with both y and z, but neither x nor z is contained within the other.
   Verdict: Possible.

4. TPP(x,z) (x is part of z and touches the boundary of z):
   For x to be entirely contained within z, z would need to be larger. However, since z is strictly inside y and x has a part outside y (due to PO(x,y)), x cannot be entirely contained within z.
   Verdict: Not Possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (x is strictly inside z):
   Similar to the reasoning for TPP, since z is inside y and x has a part outside y, x cannot be strictly inside z.
   Verdict: Not Possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (z is part of x and touches the boundary of x):
   This is possible. Given that z is inside y, the part of x that overlaps with y could potentially fully contain z. If z touches the boundary of x (which is inside y), then z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Example: Imagine y as a large circle, z as a small circle inside y away from the boundary of y, and x as a shape that overlaps with y such that z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x.
   Verdict: Possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is strictly inside x):
   Again, the part of x that overlaps with y could entirely contain z. If z is away from the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Example: Imagine y as a large circle, z as a small circle inside y away from the boundary of y, and x as a shape that overlaps with y such that z is completely inside x and away from the boundary of x.
   Verdict: Possible.

8. EQ(x,z) (x and z are identical):
   Since z is strictly inside y, and x has a part outside y (due to PO(x,y)), x and z cannot be identical.
   Verdict: Not Possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the answer is: DC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

Actually for the sake of completion, let me give a specific concrete example of a TPPi(x,z) valid configuration.

Imagine:
- y is a disk (a filled circle) with radius 10 centered at the origin (0, 0).
- z is a disk with radius 2 centered at the point (3, 3). Since the distance from (3, 3) to the origin is sqrt(3^2 + 3^2) ≈ 4.24, which is less than 10, z is inside y. Also, the boundary of z is at distance 2 from (3, 3), so the closest point of z to the boundary of y is at a distance of approximately 10 - (4.24 + 2) ≈ 3.76, confirming that z is indeed a non-tangential proper part of y.
- x is a disk with radius 4 centered at the point (5, 0). The distance from (5, 0) to the origin is 5, and x's radius is 4, so the distance from x's boundary to y's boundary at one point is 10 - (5 + 4) = 1. Thus, x partially overlaps with y.

Now, let's check the relationship between x and z:
- The distance between the centers of x and z is sqrt((5 - 3)^2 + (0 - 3)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13) ≈ 3.61.
- x's radius is 4, and z's radius is 2.
- Since 3.61 < 4, the center of z is inside x. But the distance 3.61 is close to 4, so z is almost at the boundary of x.
- Specifically, the distance from the center of z to the boundary of x is 4 - 3.61 = 0.39.
- Since z's radius is 2, which is greater than 0.39, z actually overlaps with the boundary of x, making z a tangential proper part of x.

So, in this concrete example, we have:
- PO(x, y)
- NTPPi(y, z)
- TPPi(x, z)

Which confirms that TPPi(x, z) is a valid possibility.

Alright, to summarize, given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So the answer is: DC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

ANSWER:

I'll analyze the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other)
- NTPPi(y,z): which means NTPP(z,y), so z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Let me check each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Since z is strictly inside y, and x only partially overlaps with y, x can overlap with parts of y that don't contain z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, for x to touch z without overlapping, x would have to reach z without sharing interior with it, which is impossible given the constraints.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y can partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. Since z is completely inside y and x has parts outside y (from PO(x,y)), x cannot be completely contained in z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y can completely contain z, with z touching the boundary of x inside y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. Similar to TPPi, but z doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since z is completely inside y and x has parts outside y, they cannot be equal.
