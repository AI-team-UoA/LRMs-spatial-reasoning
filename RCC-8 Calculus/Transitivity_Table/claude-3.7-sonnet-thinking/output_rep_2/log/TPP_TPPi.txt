PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what each of these relations means:

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is contained in y, and x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z inversely, which is the same as TPP(z,y). That is, z is contained in y, and z touches the boundary of y.

So we have:
1. x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine what the possible relationships between x and z could be.

Given that both x and z are contained within y and both touch the boundary of y, there are several possible configurations:

1. x and z could be disconnected (DC). This would happen if x and z are in different "parts" of y and don't overlap.

2. x and z could be externally connected (EC). This could happen if x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

3. x and z could partially overlap (PO). This would happen if x and z share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP). This would happen if x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP). This would happen if x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi). This would happen if z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary.

7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi). This would happen if z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. x and z could be equal (EQ). This would happen if x and z occupy the same space.

Let me analyze these possibilities based on the given constraints.

Since both x and z are proper parts of y, we know that they are both smaller than y. This means they could potentially be disconnected, externally connected, or partially overlapping.

They could also be in a containment relationship with each other. For instance, x could be fully contained within z, or z could be fully contained within x.

Finally, they could be equal to each other.

I think all these relationships are geometrically possible given the constraints that TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) (or equivalently, TPP(z,y)).

Let me list the possibilities:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)
6. TPPi(x,z)
7. NTPPi(x,z)
8. EQ(x,z)

Hmm, I'm not sure if all of these are possible. Let me check each one more carefully.

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z inversely, which is the same as TPP(z,y). So z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Actually, I made a mistake in my understanding of TPPi(y,z). TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which means TPP(z,y). So TPPi(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and y touches z's boundary.

So we have:
1. x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary (TPP(x,y)).
2. y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary (TPPi(y,z)).

This means y is "inside" z, and x is "inside" y. So we have a nesting: x is inside y, which is inside z. 

Given this nesting, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, we know that x is also inside z. This means x is either a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

If x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, then it's possible for x to also touch the boundary of z (in the point where y touches z). In this case, we would have TPP(x,z).

However, it's also possible for x to be completely contained within y such that it doesn't touch the boundary of z. In this case, we would have NTPP(x,z).

I don't think any of the other relationships are possible given the constraints.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. TPP(x,z)
2. NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check this by visualizing a couple of examples.

TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary (equivalent to TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary).

Wait, I'm confused again. Let me re-read the definitions.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.
TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), so it means z is a tangential proper part of y.

OK so z is a tangential proper part of y, and x is a tangential proper part of y.

Given this, x and z are both within y. The possible relationships between x and z include:
1. DC(x,z): They don't share any points.
2. EC(x,z): They touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): They partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): They are the same.

I think all of these are geometrically possible, but I'm not confident. Let me double-check my understanding of TPPi.

OK so TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y).

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

So we have:
1. x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Given this, I think all the relationships I listed are possible:
1. DC(x,z): They don't share any points.
2. EC(x,z): They touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): They partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): They are the same.

However, I think I'm still missing something. Let me think about it differently.

TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x touches the boundary of y.
TPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z, and y touches the boundary of z.

So, x is inside y, which is inside z.

Since x is inside y and y is inside z, we know that x is inside z. This means x is a proper part of z. But does x touch the boundary of z?

If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x would also touch the boundary of z. This would make x a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

If x doesn't touch the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x would not touch the boundary of z. This would make x a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

I don't see how any of the other relationships could be possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. TPP(x,z)
2. NTPP(x,z)

Actually, wait. I've been overly restrictive in my thinking. Let me double-check by considering a concrete example.

Imagine three concentric circles: a small one (x), a medium one (y), and a large one (z). The small circle (x) touches the boundary of the medium circle (y), and the medium circle (y) touches the boundary of the large circle (z). But the small circle (x) doesn't touch the boundary of the large circle (z). In this case, TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), but NTPP(x,z).

Now, let's modify this and make the small circle (x) touch the boundary of the large circle (z) at the same point where the medium circle (y) touches it. In this case, TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

So we have two possibilities: TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

But what about the other relationships?

For DC(x,z), x and z would have to be disconnected. But since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is also inside z. They can't be disconnected.

For EC(x,z), x and z would have to touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. But since x is inside z, they share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z), x and z would have to partially overlap. But since x is a proper part of z, x is fully contained within z. They don't partially overlap.

For TPPi(x,z), z would have to be a proper part of x. But since x is a proper part of z, z cannot be a proper part of x (unless they're equal, but then it's EQ(x,z), not TPPi(x,z)).

For NTPPi(x,z), z would have to be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. Again, since x is a proper part of z, z cannot be a proper part of x.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would have to be the same. But since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, x is strictly smaller than z. They can't be equal.

So I now believe the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are:
1. TPP(x,z)
2. NTPP(x,z)

OK actually wait, let me re-read the problem statement to make sure I understand the relation TPPi correctly.

OK so TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). That is, z is a tangential proper part of y. So:

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

So both x and z are tangential proper parts of y.

In this case, the possible relationships between x and z include:
1. DC(x,z): They don't share any points.
2. EC(x,z): They touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): They partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): They are the same.

Let me try to visualize each of these.

DC(x,z): x and z are both inside y, but they don't overlap. This is geometrically possible.
EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is geometrically possible.
PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is geometrically possible.
TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This is geometrically possible.
NTPP(x,z): x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is geometrically possible.
TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is geometrically possible.
NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is geometrically possible.
EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. This is geometrically possible.

I'm confident now that all of these relationships are geometrically possible, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually, I will re-read the problem statement once more to be super careful, because I've been confused about TPPi before.

OK, looking back at the problem statement: 

"TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary."

"TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x)."

Given this, TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, we have:
TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

I'm now confident in my understanding. Both x and z are proper parts of y and both touch y's boundary.

Given that both x and z are inside y and both touch y's boundary, many different configurations are possible:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are separate within y, not touching each other.
2. EC(x,z): x and z just touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same.

All of these are geometrically possible, given the constraints that TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Actually, one small clarification: when x is part of y, it means that x is contained in y, not just that they share points.

Hmm, wait I'm realizing I've been reading the problem incorrectly. Let's be precise.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is fully contained in y, and x touches y's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z). TPP(y,z) would mean y is a tangential proper part of z. So TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So we have:
TPP(x,y): x is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z): z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary.

Both x and z are fully contained in y and both touch y's boundary.

Given these constraints, I'm confident that all eight relationships between x and z are geometrically possible:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)
6. TPPi(x,z)
7. NTPPi(x,z)
8. EQ(x,z)

You know what, let me draw these out on a piece of "paper" to confirm.

For DC(x,z): Imagine y as a square. x is a small circle in the top-left corner of the square, touching its boundary. z is a small circle in the bottom-right corner, touching its boundary. Here, x and z are disconnected.

For EC(x,z): Imagine y as a square. x is a small circle in the left half of the square, touching its left boundary. z is a small circle in the right half of the square, touching its right boundary. The circles are positioned so they just touch each other in the middle of the square. Here, x and z are externally connected.

For PO(x,z): Imagine y as a square. x is a circle in the left half of the square, touching its left boundary. z is a circle in the right half of the square, touching its right boundary. The circles are positioned so they overlap in the middle of the square. Here, x and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z): Imagine y as a square. z is a large circle inside the square, touching its boundary. x is a smaller circle inside z, touching both z's boundary and y's boundary at the same point. Here, x is a tangential proper part of z.

For NTPP(x,z): Imagine y as a square. z is a large circle inside the square, touching its boundary. x is a smaller circle inside z, touching y's boundary at a point where z does not touch y. Here, x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Wait, that doesn't work, because x would have to be outside of z to touch y's boundary. Let me rethink.

For NTPP(x,z): Imagine y as a square. z is a large circle inside the square, touching its boundary. x is a smaller circle inside z, not touching z's boundary but touching y's boundary. Wait, this still doesn't work, because if x touches y's boundary, it must be at a point where z also touches y's boundary (since x is inside z). So x would also touch z's boundary.

Hmm, I think I've been making a mistake. If x is inside z (as in NTPP(x,z)), and z touches y's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, then x must touch y's boundary at the same point where z touches y's boundary. This means x would also touch z's boundary, making it TPP(x,z), not NTPP(x,z).

I think NTPP(x,z) is not possible. Let's recheck the others.

For TPPi(x,z): Imagine y as a square. x is a large circle inside the square, touching its boundary. z is a smaller circle inside x, touching both x's boundary and y's boundary at the same point. Here, z is a tangential proper part of x.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similar to NTPP(x,z), I think this is not possible for the same reason.

For EQ(x,z): Imagine y as a square. Both x and z are the same circle inside the square, touching its boundary. Here, x and z are equal.

I'm now not sure about NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me think more carefully.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be inside z and not touch z's boundary. But we also know that x touches y's boundary. Since z is inside y, z's boundary is either inside y or it touches y's boundary. If z's boundary touches y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then x must touch y's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch y's boundary. If x is inside z, the only way for x to touch y's boundary is if z also touches y's boundary at that point (because x can't "reach" y's boundary without passing through z). But if x and z both touch y's boundary at the same point, and x is inside z, then x must also touch z's boundary. This contradicts the definition of NTPP. 

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z would be inside x and not touch x's boundary. We know z touches y's boundary. If z touches y's boundary, and z is inside x, then z must touch y's boundary at a point where x also touches y's boundary. But if x and z both touch y's boundary at the same point, and z is inside x, then z must also touch x's boundary. This contradicts the definition of NTPPi.

So I think NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

Let's check the others once more:

For DC(x,z): Imagine y as a square. x is a small circle in the top-left corner of the square, touching its boundary. z is a small circle in the bottom-right corner, touching its boundary. Here, x and z are disconnected. This works.

For EC(x,z): Imagine y as a square. x is a small circle in the left half of the square, touching its left boundary. z is a small circle in the right half of the square, touching its right boundary. The circles are positioned so they just touch each other in the middle of the square. Here, x and z are externally connected. This works.

For PO(x,z): Imagine y as a square. x is a circle in the left half of the square, touching its left boundary. z is a circle in the right half of the square, touching its right boundary. The circles are positioned so they overlap in the middle of the square. Here, x and z partially overlap. This works.

For TPP(x,z): Imagine y as a square. z is a large circle inside the square, touching its boundary. x is a smaller circle inside z, positioned so that it touches both z's boundary and y's boundary at the same point where z touches y's boundary. Here, x is a tangential proper part of z. This works.

For TPPi(x,z): Imagine y as a square. x is a large circle inside the square, touching its boundary. z is a smaller circle inside x, positioned so that it touches both x's boundary and y's boundary at the same point where x touches y's boundary. Here, z is a tangential proper part of x. This works.

For EQ(x,z): Imagine y as a square. Both x and z are the same circle inside the square, touching its boundary. Here, x and z are equal. This works.

Hmm, I'm considering that maybe NTPP and NTPPi are possible, but I need to visualize them differently.

For NTPP(x,z): Imagine y as a circle. z is an ellipse inside y, touching y's boundary at the left and right edges. x is a small circle inside z, touching y's boundary at the top edge (where z does not touch y). This way, x is inside z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Actually, that doesn't work either. If x is inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then that point where x touches y's boundary must also be on z's boundary. This is because z is a barrier between x and the outside of z.

I think NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are indeed not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

Actually, I just had a realization. I may have been too restrictive in my visualizations by using simple shapes. Let's consider more complex shapes.

For NTPP(x,z): Imagine y as a square. z is a C-shaped region inside y, touching y's boundary at several points. x is a small circle inside the open part of the C, touching y's boundary at a point where z also touches y's boundary, but not touching z's boundary. Here, x is inside z (because the C encloses it), touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary.

Hmm, I think I'm confusing myself. If x is inside z, any boundary point of x must either be inside z or on z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary, that point must be on z's boundary too (since z is between x and y). So I still think NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's do a rigorous proof using the definitions:

1. TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's say NTPP(x,z) is true. This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

From TPP(x,y), we know x touches y's boundary. Let's call this point of contact p.
Since x is inside z, and x touches y's boundary at p, z must also touch y's boundary at p (because z is between x and y).
But if x and z both touch y's boundary at p, then x must also touch z's boundary at p. This contradicts NTPP(x,z), which says x doesn't touch z's boundary.

So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), we can show it's not possible.

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

Actually, let's think outside the box one more time.

For NTPP(x,z): Imagine y as a cube. z is a sphere inside the cube, touching the cube's boundary at a single point p. x is a smaller sphere inside z, touching the cube's boundary at a point q different from p. In this 3D scenario, x can be inside z, touch y's boundary, but not touch z's boundary.

But wait, I'm forgetting x is inside z. If x is inside z, then x can only touch y's boundary at a point where z also touches y's boundary. And if x and z both touch y's boundary at the same point, then x must also touch z's boundary at that point, contradicting NTPP(x,z). So my 3D example doesn't work either.

But my reasoning might still be off. Let me try to visualize this more clearly.

Maybe it's possible in a non-standard topology. But in the context of RCC-8, we are dealing with regions in a topological space, and the constraints I described earlier should hold.

OK, I believe it's not possible to have NTPP(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

Just to be super-sure, let me reverify my understanding.

In RCC-8, here's what I understand:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is fully contained in y and is not equal to y), and x touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper part of z (i.e., y is fully contained in z and is not equal to z), and y touches z's boundary.

But wait, I've been assuming a different definition for TPPi(y,z). Let me go back to the problem statement.

TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).

So TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So the conditions are:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z) = TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

OK, so both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. They're both inside y and touch y's boundary. Given this, I think all the relationships I listed are possible:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

And I'm now doubtful about my arguments against NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me recheck.

For NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary, is it possible for x to be inside z, touch y's boundary, but not touch z's boundary?

I think I've been making a mistake in my reasoning. If x is inside z, and both x and z touch y's boundary, it doesn't necessarily mean they touch y's boundary at the same point. They could touch y's boundary at different points.

For instance, imagine y as a square. z is a donut-shaped region inside the square, touching the top of the square. x is a small circle inside the hole of the donut, touching the bottom of the square. Here, x is inside z (because the donut shape surrounds it), both x and z touch y's boundary, but at different points, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

That's not quite right. If x is inside the hole of a donut, it's not inside the donut itself. The hole is not part of the donut.

Actually, I'm going back to my earlier reasoning. If x is inside z, any point of x is either inside z or on z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary at a point p, then p is both a point of x and a point of y's boundary. Since p is a point of x, it's either inside z or on z's boundary. If p is inside z, then it's not on y's boundary (since z is inside y). So p must be on z's boundary. But then x touches z's boundary at p, which contradicts NTPP(x,z).

So I still believe NTPP(x,z) is not possible. I have to make a choice between NTPP(x, z) and TPP(x, y): if x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, it can't possibly touch y's boundary. But TPP(x, y) requires that x touch y's boundary, so that's a contradiction.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary, is it possible for z to be inside x, touch y's boundary, but not touch x's boundary?

Using similar reasoning as before, if z is inside x, any point of z is either inside x or on x's boundary. If z touches y's boundary at a point p, then p is both a point of z and a point of y's boundary. Since p is a point of z, it's either inside x or on x's boundary. If p is inside x, then it's not on y's boundary (since x is inside y). So p must be on x's boundary. But then z touches x's boundary at p, which contradicts NTPPi(x,z).

So I believe NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

I'm now confident that the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (they touch but don't overlap).
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

So the answer is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ.

Let's triple check by switching notation. If a is a tangential proper part of b, we write TPP(a, b).

We're given that TPP(x, y) and TPPi(y, z). The thing is TPPi(y, z) = TPP(z, y). So we know TPP(x, y) and TPP(z, y).

We want to know the relationship between x and z. 

TPP(x, y): x is a proper part of y, and x touches y's boundary.
TPP(z, y): z is a proper part of y, and z touches y's boundary.

Since both x and z are proper parts of y, the whole of x is contained in y, and the whole of z is contained in y. 

1. DC(x,z): x and z don't share any points. This is possible if x and z are in different parts of y.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if z is large enough to contain x, and x touches z's boundary.
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if x is large enough to contain z, and z touches x's boundary.
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is possible if x and z occupy the same space.

The cases I'm still unsure about are NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)), and z is a proper part of y, is it possible for x to be inside z, touch y's boundary, but not touch z's boundary?

As I argued earlier, if x is inside z, and x touches y's boundary at a point p, then z must also touch y's boundary at p. If x and z both touch y's boundary at p, then x must also touch z's boundary at p. This contradicts NTPP(x,z), which says x doesn't touch z's boundary.

So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that z touches y's boundary (from TPP(z,y)), and x is a proper part of y, is it possible for z to be inside x, touch y's boundary, but not touch x's boundary?

Using similar reasoning, if z is inside x, and z touches y's boundary at a point p, then x must also touch y's boundary at p. If x and z both touch y's boundary at p, then z must also touch x's boundary at p. This contradicts NTPPi(x,z), which says z doesn't touch x's boundary.

So NTPPi(x,z) is also not possible.

So my best answer is that the possible relationships between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), are:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (they touch but don't overlap).
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

So the answer is x can be related to z by: DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ.

ANSWER:

Alright, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between regions x and z, given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and touches y's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z): which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y

So both x and z are tangential proper parts of y - they're both contained in y and both touch y's boundary.

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x and z can be completely disconnected within y
2. EC(x,z): Possible - x and z can touch at their boundaries without overlapping
3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - if x is inside z without touching z's boundary, then x couldn't touch y's boundary (which TPP(x,y) requires)
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - if z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then z couldn't touch y's boundary (which TPP(z,y) requires)
8. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be identical regions
