PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this carefully:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): This means y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial parts, but neither is contained in the other.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's go through the RCC-8 relations systematically:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   No, this is not possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, at least a part of z must overlap with x through y.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are externally connected (touching at their boundaries)?
   No, this is not possible either. Since y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary) and y overlaps with z, their point of contact would be inside x, not at x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   Yes, this is possible. z could overlap with y (which is inside x) and also extend outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, this is possible. x could be contained in z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, this is possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   Yes, this is possible. z could be contained in x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   Yes, this is possible. z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   Yes, this is possible. x and z could be coincident.

Let me double-check each of these by drawing some example diagrams in my mind:

3. PO(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle strictly inside x, and z as a circle that partially overlaps with y and extends outside of x. This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): Imagine x as a medium circle, y as a smaller circle strictly inside x, and z as a large circle that contains both x and y, with x touching z's boundary. This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Imagine x as a medium circle, y as a smaller circle strictly inside x, and z as a very large circle that completely contains x, with x not touching z's boundary. This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, y as a small circle strictly inside x, and z as a medium circle that contains y but is properly contained in x, touching x's boundary. This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, y as a small circle strictly inside x, and z as a medium circle that contains y but is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary). This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Imagine x and z as coincident circles, and y as a smaller circle strictly inside both. This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and EQ(x,z).

Wait, I need to reconsider some of these. Let me think more carefully.

For PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap, meaning they share some parts but neither is contained in the other. If y is strictly inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), then the part of z that overlaps with y must also be inside x. However, since neither y nor z is contained in the other, z must extend beyond y.

Let me reconsider each case:

3. PO(x,z): If z extends outside of x, then x and z would indeed partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be fully contained in z and touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) if z is large enough to contain x and has some parts that overlap with y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to above, if z is large enough to fully contain x without x touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be fully contained in x and touch x's boundary. But if y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary) and z overlaps with y but neither contains the other, then z must extend beyond y towards x's boundary. This is still consistent, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be fully contained in x without touching x's boundary. This is possible if z is contained within the space between y and x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be equal, they must coincide exactly. If y is strictly inside x, and z coincides with x, then y would be strictly inside z as well. But then PO(y,z) wouldn't hold (it would be NTPP(y,z) instead). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I need to reconsider my analysis for some of these cases. 

Let's try to approach this differently. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is completely contained inside x without touching its boundary. PO(y,z) means that y and z share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Given these constraints, z must:
1. Share some parts with y (due to PO(y,z)).
2. Have some parts that are not in y (due to PO(y,z)).
3. These parts of z could be inside x, outside x, or both.

Let's re-analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since z shares parts with y, and y is inside x, z must also share parts with x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. But since z shares parts with y, and y is strictly inside x, z and x must share interior points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is possible if z extends outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be true, z must fully contain x and touch its boundary. This is consistent with our constraints if z is large enough to fully contain x and has parts that overlap with y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to above, if z is large enough to fully contain x without touching its boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, x must fully contain z, and z must touch x's boundary. Given PO(y,z), z must extend beyond y (since neither contains the other), possibly all the way to x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For this to be true, z must be fully contained in x without touching its boundary. This is possible if z is contained within the space between y and x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. If x equals z, then given y is non-tangentially proper part of x, y will also be a non-tangentially proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me draw some simple diagrams in my mind to check these:

For PO(x,z):
- x: A large circle.
- y: A smaller circle inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z: A circle that partially overlaps with y and extends outside of x.
This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and results in PO(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
- x: A medium circle.
- y: A smaller circle inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z: A large circle that fully contains x (with x touching z's boundary) and partially overlaps with y.
This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and results in TPP(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z):
- x: A medium circle.
- y: A smaller circle inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z: A very large circle that completely contains x (with x not touching z's boundary) and partially overlaps with y.
This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and results in NTPP(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z):
- x: A large circle.
- y: A small circle inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z: A medium circle that partially overlaps with y and is contained in x, touching x's boundary.
This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and results in TPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z):
- x: A large circle.
- y: A small circle inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z: A medium circle that partially overlaps with y and is contained in x, not touching x's boundary.
This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and results in NTPPi(x,z).

For EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same, I was right that there's a contradiction because we'd have both NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) = PO(y,x). Let me check if this is actually a contradiction.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is strictly inside x, which is the opposite of y containing all of x, and also the opposite of y and x not sharing any space. PO(y,x) would mean y and x share some parts, but neither contains the other. But NTPPi(x,y) specifically means x contains all of y, so we'd have both "x contains all of y" and "neither x nor y contains the other", which is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

My final determination of the possible relationships between x and z is:
PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Let me check if I made any errors.

Wait, I'm not sure I analyzed PO(y,z) correctly. PO(y,z) means that y and z share some space, but neither is completely contained in the other. If y is strictly inside x, and z overlaps with y, then part of z must be inside x. Another part of z must be outside y (due to PO's definition), but this part could still be inside x.

Let me reconsider the EQ(x,z) case. If x equals z, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then y would also be a non-tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me also double-check the TPP(x,z) case. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained in z, touching z's boundary. Could this be consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z)? Yes, if y is strictly inside x, and z contains all of x, then y is also inside z. But for PO(y,z) to hold, y and z must share some space, but neither can be contained in the other. So, y cannot be fully contained in z. But if x is fully contained in z, and y is fully contained in x, then y is fully contained in z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained in z, not touching z's boundary. This would imply that y is also completely contained in z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For the remaining cases, PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z), let's validate by drawing:

For PO(x,z):
- x: A large circle.
- y: A smaller circle inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z: A circle that overlaps with part of y, extends beyond y, but not fully containing y, and also extends outside of x.
This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and results in PO(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z):
- x: A large circle.
- y: A small circle inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z: A medium circle that overlaps with part of y, extends beyond y, but not fully containing y, and is contained in x, touching x's boundary.
This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and results in TPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z):
- x: A large circle.
- y: A small circle inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- z: A medium circle that overlaps with part of y, extends beyond y, but not fully containing y, and is contained in x, not touching x's boundary.
This satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and results in NTPPi(x,z).

I think there's some subtlety here. Let me think more carefully.

If NTPPi(x,y), then y is strictly inside x, away from its boundary. If PO(y,z), then z overlaps with y, but neither is fully contained in the other.

For PO(x,z):
If z extends outside of x, and also overlaps with y inside x, then x and z would partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, z must fully contain x. But if y is inside x, and z overlaps with y but doesn't fully contain y, there's a contradiction. z can't both fully contain x (and hence y) and not fully contain y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
Similar to above, if z must fully contain x, there's a contradiction with PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be fully contained in x, touching x's boundary. Given PO(y,z), z overlaps with y but neither fully contains the other. This is consistent: z can be fully inside x, touching its boundary, and partially overlap with y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be fully contained in x, away from its boundary. Again, this is consistent with PO(y,z) if z partially overlaps with y. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z):
For x and z to be equal, they must coincide. If y is strictly inside x, and z equals x, then y would be strictly inside z as well, which contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

For DC(x,z) and EC(x,z):
As determined earlier, these are not possible because z overlaps with y, which is inside x, so z and x must also overlap.

So, my revised determination is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

In fact, let me try drawing once more to make sure I'm not contradicting the constraints:

For PO(x,z):
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x, not touching the boundary of x
- z is a circle that:
  1. Partially overlaps with y (due to PO(y,z))
  2. Is not fully contained in y (due to PO(y,z))
  3. Does not fully contain y (due to PO(y,z))
  4. Extends outside of x
This configuration satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and gives us PO(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z):
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x, not touching the boundary of x
- z is a circle that:
  1. Partially overlaps with y (due to PO(y,z))
  2. Is not fully contained in y (due to PO(y,z))
  3. Does not fully contain y (due to PO(y,z))
  4. Is fully contained in x, touching x's boundary
This configuration satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and gives us TPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z):
- x is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x, not touching the boundary of x
- z is a circle that:
  1. Partially overlaps with y (due to PO(y,z))
  2. Is not fully contained in y (due to PO(y,z))
  3. Does not fully contain y (due to PO(y,z))
  4. Is fully contained in x, not touching x's boundary
This configuration satisfies NTPPi(x,y), PO(y,z), and gives us NTPPi(x,z).

These seem consistent. I need to check a bit more carefully for the other cases:

For TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), I wanted to double-check: No z should fully contain x, because if it did, it would then fully contain y, as y is fully inside x. But then z would fully contain y, which contradicts PO(y,z). So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

For DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), as determined earlier, these are not possible because z must overlap with x (through y). Moreover, the overlapping regions are interior points, so they can't just touch at the boundary.

For EQ(x,z), as I determined earlier, if x and z are the same, then y would be fully inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationships between x and z are:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Actually let me go once more time from the beginning to make sure I get this right. 

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial parts, but neither is contained in the other.

The possibilities for the relationship between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected, share no spatial parts.
   Wait, this is not possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, at least the part of z that overlaps with y must be inside x. So, x and z must share at least one spatial part and cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts.
   This is not possible either. Since y is inside x and away from x's boundary, and y overlaps with z, the intersection of y and z would be in the interior of x. So, x and z would share interior parts and cannot be just touching at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. They share some spatial parts, but neither is contained in the other.
   This is possible. z can overlap with y inside x and also extend outside of x. The part of z that overlaps with y is inside x, but z also has parts outside of x, so neither x nor z is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.
   If x is fully contained in z, then y would also be fully contained in z (since y is inside x). But this contradicts PO(y,z), which states that neither y nor z is fully contained in the other. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x is fully contained in z and does not touch z's boundary.
   Similar to the above, if x is fully contained in z, then y would also be fully contained in z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary.
   This is possible. z can be fully inside x, touching x's boundary, and partially overlap with y (which is also inside x). This doesn't contradict any of the given conditions.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is fully contained in x and does not touch x's boundary.
   This is also possible. z can be fully inside x, not touching x's boundary, and partially overlap with y. There's no contradiction here.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same.
   If x equals z, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then y would also be a non-tangential proper part of z. This contradicts PO(y,z), which states that neither y nor z is fully contained in the other. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, based on the given conditions, the possible relationships between x and z are:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Let me check once more for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), because those are the trickiest ones.

If TPP(x,z), then x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. Given NTPPi(x,y), y is fully inside x, away from x's boundary. So, y is also fully inside z, away from z's boundary. This means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(y,z). But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says neither y nor z is fully contained in the other. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, if NTPP(x,z), y would be a non-tangential proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

OK, so my final anwer is that the possible relationships are:
PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the constraints given by NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), then determine which of the eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some parts, but neither contains the other)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside x and overlaps with z, x and z must share at least the overlapping region.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is strictly inside x (away from boundary) and overlaps with z, the overlap between y and z occurs in x's interior, not just at x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. z can overlap with y inside x while also extending outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were completely inside z, then y would also be completely inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPP - would force y to be completely inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary while partially overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary while partially overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
