PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know:
1. EC(x,y) - x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
2. NTPP(y,z) - y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary

We need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's think about what EC(x,y) means geometrically: x touches y at the boundary, but they don't overlap.

And NTPP(y,z) means: y is completely contained within z, not touching z's boundary anywhere.

So, combining these: 
- y touches x at the boundary of y
- y is completely contained within z, away from z's boundary

Now, what are the possibilities for the relation between x and z?

1. Could x be disconnected from z (DC)? 
   If x only touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely within z (not touching z's boundary), then x could potentially be completely outside z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. Could x touch z's boundary (EC)?
   Since y is completely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, x could touch z's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. Could x partially overlap with z (PO)?
   Yes, if x extends into z (beyond just touching y) but also has a part outside z, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)?
   Yes, if x is completely within z but touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)?
   If x is completely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)?
   No, since y is completely inside z and x only touches y at the boundary, z cannot be completely contained within x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)?
   No, for the same reason as above, z cannot be completely contained within x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. Could x be equal to z (EQ)?
   No, since y is completely inside z and x only touches y at the boundary, x cannot be equal to z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I need to be a bit more careful here. Let me reconsider:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- NTPP(y,z): y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary

Let's analyze what this means:
- x touches y only at y's boundary
- y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary

Now, considering the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
This is possible if x touches y at y's boundary but doesn't enter z at all. Since y is away from z's boundary, x touching y's boundary doesn't guarantee that x touches z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected:
This is possible if x touches z only at z's boundary. Since y is not at z's boundary, x touching y doesn't mean x touches z's boundary. But x could touch z elsewhere along z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping:
This is possible if x extends into z's interior (beyond just touching y) but also has a part outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part:
This is possible if x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary. This could happen even if x touches y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-Tangential Proper Part:
This is possible if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This could happen if x is small and only touches y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a Tangential Proper Part of x:
Given that y is completely inside z and away from z's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, it's not possible for z to be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of x:
For the same reason as above, z cannot be completely contained within x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
Given that y is completely inside z and away from z's boundary, and x only touches y at y's boundary, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x must be disconnected from z. But since y is completely inside z (NTPP), and x touches y at the boundary (EC), we need to check if this is geometrically possible.

Actually it's not possible for x to be disconnected from z. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is fully inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x must intersect with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

OK actually I need to be more careful again. Let's draw a picture to help us visualize:

Suppose z is a circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a region outside of y that touches y only at y's boundary.

Now, considering the various RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
If x is a small region that only touches y's boundary and doesn't extend beyond it, and if y is away from z's boundary, then x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This contradicts DC.

Wait, that's not right. If x is completely inside z, it's not disconnected from z. Let me think more clearly.

For DC(x,z), x and z would need to be completely separate, with no common points. But since x touches y (EC(x,y)) and y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), x and z must share at least the point where x touches y. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me rethink this. If EC(x,y), then x and y share only boundary points, no interior points. And if NTPP(y,z), then y is strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Now, when trying to determine if DC(x,z) is possible, we need to see if x and z can be completely separate. If y is completely inside z, and x touches y, then x and z share at least the point where x touches y. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

OK, let's be more precise. DC(x,z) means there is no point that is part of both x and z. If x touches y at its boundary, then there exists a point p such that p is on the boundary of x and on the boundary of y. If y is strictly inside z, then this point p is inside z, which means p is part of both x and z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Oops, actually that reasoning wasn't quite right. If p is on the boundary of x, it's not necessarily "part of" x in the sense of being in the interior of x. Let me think more carefully.

Let's redo this whole analysis:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- NTPP(y,z): y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary

The key insight is that NTPP(y,z) means that y is completely contained within the interior of z.

Since y is part of the interior of z and x touches y at its boundary, x must interact with the interior of z. This means:

1. DC(x,z) is not possible since x must interact with the interior of z.

2. EC(x,z) is not possible because x would have to touch z only at its boundary, but we've established that x interacts with the interior of z.

3. PO(x,z) is possible if x partially overlaps with the interior of z and also extends outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) is possible if x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) is possible if x is completely inside z without touching its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) is not possible since y is contained within z, and x only touches y at its boundary, so z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) is not possible for the same reason.

8. EQ(x,z) is not possible since y is a proper part of z and x is not a proper part of y, so x cannot be equal to z.

Actually, on second thought, I think I'm overlooking some possibilities. Let me reconsider EC(x,z).

If y is a proper part of the interior of z (NTPP), and x touches y at its boundary, can x touch z at its boundary?

Yes, it's possible. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a small circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a long, bent shape that touches y at one end and extends to touch z's boundary at the other end. In this scenario, x would have a part inside the interior of z (the part that touches y), but would also touch z's boundary, making EC(x,z) valid.

But wait, that's not right. If x has a part inside the interior of z, it's not just touching z at its boundary. It's overlapping with the interior of z, which contradicts EC(x,z). So, actually, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, I should be more careful here. The definition of EC(x,y) specifies that x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. But for RCC-8, regions are typically considered to be regular and closed sets. This means that the boundary of a region is considered part of the region.

So, if EC(x,y) is true, it means x and y share some boundary points, but no interior points.

Now, if NTPP(y,z) is true, then y is completely inside the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

If x touches y at y's boundary but doesn't overlap with y's interior, and if y is completely within the interior of z, what does that imply for the relationship between x and z?

Since y is completely within the interior of z, the boundary of y is also within the interior of z. If x touches y at y's boundary, it means x has a part that is within the interior of z. This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

For the relationship to be PO(x,z), x would have to have a part inside z and a part outside z. This is definitely possible. For example, if x is a shape that touches y at y's boundary and extends outside z.

For TPP(x,z), x would have to be completely inside z but touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is a shape that touches y but is also large enough to reach z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z), x would have to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is small and only touches y.

For TPPi(x,z), z would have to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. This is not possible because y is completely inside z and x only touches y, so z cannot be inside x.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's make sure this is correct.

For PO(x,z), x would have to partially overlap with z. This is possible if x touches y at y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and extends beyond z.

For TPP(x,z), x would have to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y at y's boundary (EC(x,y)), x could be a shape that touches y and extends to z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) valid.

For NTPP(x,z), x would have to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is small and only touches y, and doesn't reach z's boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually I realize that I made a mistake. TPP(x,z) is not possible. 

If NTPP(y,z), then y is completely inside the interior of z, away from z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x touches y only at y's boundary. Given these, can x be completely inside z and touch z's boundary (TPP(x,z))?

Let's see. If x touches y only at y's boundary and is completely inside z, then x would have to be shaped in a way that it reaches from y's boundary to z's boundary. But if y is completely within the interior of z, there's a gap between y and z's boundary. For x to bridge this gap, it would have to have a part that's not touching y. In other words, x would have to extend beyond the point where it touches y. 

But this doesn't contradict our assumptions. For EC(x,y), we're saying x and y share only boundary points, not that x is only present at the boundary of y. So, x can extend beyond its point of contact with y, reaching z's boundary while being completely inside z. Thus, TPP(x,z) is possible.

Let me reconsider more carefully whether TPP(x,z) is possible. If NTPP(y,z), then y is completely inside the interior of z, away from z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x touches y only at y's boundary. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.

Imagine z as a big circle, y as a small circle inside z (away from z's boundary), and x as a shape that extends from y's boundary to z's boundary, but doesn't go outside z. In this scenario, x is completely inside z (making it a proper part of z), touches z's boundary, and also touches y at y's boundary (without overlapping with y's interior). This would make TPP(x,z) valid.

I think I'm going back and forth a bit on this. Let me try to be definitive.

TPP(x,z) requires that x is a non-empty proper part of z and x shares a point with the boundary of z.

I think the confusion stems from how we interpret "x touches y at y's boundary" in EC(x,y). It's saying that x and y share boundary points but not interior points.

In the scenario I described above, x is a shape that touches y at y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and extends to touch z's boundary. Can x be completely inside z in this case? if x is just at the boundary of y and also touches or extends to the boundary of z, then x has some points outside of y. But doesn't mean it's outside of z. z is larger and contains y in its interior. So it's possible for x to bridge from y's boundary to z's boundary all while being completely within z.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible. In other words, x could be a tangential proper part of z.

OK, I'm getting a bit confused, but I think the issue is that I'm overlooking that "EC" means "externally connected", which implies that the regions do not overlap, but only touch at their boundaries.

So, let's revisit this problem with a clearer understanding.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch only at their boundaries and do not share any interior points.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) (Disconnected): This is not possible. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside z, then x must have at least one point inside z (the point where it touches y).

2. EC(x,z) (Externally Connected): The definition of EC is that the two regions touch only at their boundaries. However, if x touches y, and y is inside the interior of z, then x and z share a point that's not on the boundary of z. this can't be EC(x,z).

Actually let's think more carefully about this. For EC(x,z), x would have to touch z at z's boundary, and not share any interior points with z. But if x touches y at y's boundary, and y is completely inside the interior of z, then the point where x touches y is in the interior of z. This means z shares an interior point with x, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So actually EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) (Partially Overlapping): For PO, x and z would have to overlap, but neither should be fully contained in the other. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x and z share at least one point (the point where x touches y). If x also extends outside z, then x and z would partially overlap. 

So actually PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) (Tangential Proper Part): For this, x would have to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z, then part of x is inside z. If the rest of x is also inside z, and it touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) would be valid.

So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) (Non-Tangential Proper Part): For this, x would have to be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. If x touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside z, then part of x is inside z. If the rest of x is also inside z, and it doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) would be valid.

So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a Tangential Proper Part of x): This would require z to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But since y is completely inside z, and x only touches y at y's boundary, z cannot be completely inside x.

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a Non-Tangential Proper Part of x): This would require z to be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. But for the same reason as above, this is not possible.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) (Equal): This would require x and z to be the same region. But since y is completely inside z, and x only touches y at y's boundary, x and z cannot be the same.

So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on the above reasoning, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

OK, let me make sure this is correct.

1. EC(x,y) means x and y touch only at their boundaries. This means x and y share boundary points, but not interior points.

2. NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

If x touches y at its boundary (EC(x,y)) and y is completely inside the interior of z (NTPP(y,z)), then x touches a point in the interior of z. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

If x also has a part outside z, then PO(x,z) is possible.

If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is valid.

If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is valid.

Given the constraints, z cannot be inside x or equal to x, ruling out TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually I realize that I'm being a bit sloppy in my reasoning. Let's be more precise. We are gven:

- EC(x,y): This means that x and y touch only at their boundaries. Formally, (x ∩ y) ⊆ (∂x ∩ ∂y), where ∂ represents the boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): This means that y is completely inside the interior of z, away from z's boundary. Formally, y ⊆ int(z), where int refers to the interior.

Let's consider NTPP(y,z). Since y is a proper part of the interior of z, the boundary of y, ∂y, is also contained within the interior of z, int(z). That is, ∂y ⊆ int(z).

Now, given EC(x,y), the intersection of x and y is a subset of the intersection of their boundaries. This means x and y share some boundary points. Let's say they share a point p, where p ∈ (∂x ∩ ∂y).

Given that p ∈ ∂y and ∂y ⊆ int(z), it follows that p ∈ int(z). Since p ∈ ∂x, we have a point in the boundary of x that's inside the interior of z, making x enter the interior of z.

This clarifies that x must enter the interior of z but isn't necessarily completely inside z. Thus:

- DC(x,z) is not possible, since x and z share at least one interior point (as shown above).
- EC(x,z) is not possible because x enters the interior of z, not just touching its boundary.
- PO(x,z) is possible if x has a part outside z and a part inside z.
- TPP(x,z) is possible if x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z) is possible if x is completely inside z without touching its boundary.
- TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible given the above reasoning.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I think it makes most sense to say that the possible relations between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, I think I'm being a bit sloppy in my reasoning. I've correctly reasoned that DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible. But I should be more careful about reasoning if PO, TPP, and NTPP are possible.

Let me trace through a concrete example for each to make sure.

For PO(x,z):
- Imagine z as a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside z, away from z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)).
- x is a shape that touches y at y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and extends outside z.
- In this case, x shares a part with z (the part that includes the point where it touches y), but also has a part outside z.
- This makes PO(x,z) valid.

For TPP(x,z):
- Imagine z as a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside z, away from z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)).
- x is a shape that touches y at y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and extends to touch z's boundary, but doesn't go outside z.
- In this case, x is completely inside z (making it a proper part of z) and touches z's boundary.
- This makes TPP(x,z) valid.

For NTPP(x,z):
- Imagine z as a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside z, away from z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)).
- x is a shape that touches y at y's boundary (EC(x,y)) but doesn't extend to z's boundary.
- In this case, x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- This makes NTPP(x,z) valid.

These examples reinforce my conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

So the answer is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step by step:

We know:
1. EC(x,y) - x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
2. NTPP(y,z) - y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

To determine the possible relationships between x and z:

First, since y is completely inside the interior of z (NTPP), the boundary of y (where x touches y) is also in the interior of z. This means that x must intersect with the interior of z at the point(s) where x touches y.

This immediately rules out:
- DC(x,z) - not possible since x must share at least one point with z's interior
- EC(x,z) - not possible since x intersects z's interior, not just its boundary
- TPPi(x,z) - not possible since z cannot be contained in x
- NTPPi(x,z) - not possible for the same reason
- EQ(x,z) - not possible since x and z cannot be identical

The remaining possibilities:

1. PO(x,z) - possible if x has part inside z (where it touches y) and part outside z
2. TPP(x,z) - possible if x is completely inside z and also touches z's boundary
3. NTPP(x,z) - possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
