PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, I need to determine what spatial relationship exists between x and z, given these conditions:
- TPPi(x,y) 
- EQ(y,z)

First, let's understand what these relations mean:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. That is, y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space.

Given that y and z are coincident (EQ), we can substitute z for y in the first relation.

So if TPPi(x,y) and y = z (because EQ(y,z)), then TPPi(x,z) must also hold.

This means that z is a tangential proper part of x - z is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

So the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by reasoning step by step:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (or equivalently, x is a tangential proper part inverse of y).

2. EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same spatial region.

3. If y and z are the same spatial region, then any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

4. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) must hold, meaning z is a tangential proper part of x.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Wait, I should reconsider this. TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. Then EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident. So z is also a tangential proper part of x, which means TPP(z,x), or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

So the answer is:
TPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relation holds between x and z based on the given relations:
- TPPi(x,y): This means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): This means y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since y and z are coincident (EQ), they are essentially the same spatial region. Therefore, any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that TPPi(x,y) holds, and y is identical to z, then TPPi(x,z) must also hold.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
