PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

In this problem, we are given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), and we need to determine all possible relationships between x and z.

Let's recall what PO means: PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

So PO(x,y) means:
1. x and y have a non-empty intersection (they share some spatial part).
2. x is not entirely contained within y (there's a part of x that's outside y).
3. y is not entirely contained within x (there's a part of y that's outside x).

Similarly, PO(y,z) means:
1. y and z have a non-empty intersection (they share some spatial part).
2. y is not entirely contained within z (there's a part of y that's outside z).
3. z is not entirely contained within y (there's a part of z that's outside y).

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z using the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is possible if the parts of y that overlap with x and the parts of y that overlap with z are disjoint. For instance, imagine y as a large area, with x overlapping with the left part of y and z overlapping with the right part of y, but x and z themselves don't overlap.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible if the parts of y that overlap with x and the parts of y that overlap with z touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if the parts of y that overlap with x and the parts of y that overlap with z have some overlap, but not entirely.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This seems possible, especially if y has a smaller overlap with x than with z, and the boundary of x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if y's overlap with x is completely contained within z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Similar to TPP, but with the roles of x and z reversed.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to NTPP, but with the roles of x and z reversed.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are spatially equivalent. This is possible if both x and z overlap with y in the same way.

I realize I'm not being sufficiently precise. Let's try a more formal approach, considering various concrete scenarios:

1. DC(x,z): Consider a scenario where y is a large circular region, x is a smaller circle that overlaps with the left part of y, and z is a smaller circle that overlaps with the right part of y. Assuming the left and right parts are far enough apart, x and z could be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Similarly, if y is a large circular region, and x and z are positioned such that they both overlap with y but just touch each other at their boundaries, then EC(x,z) holds.

3. PO(x,z): If y, x, and z are all circles of similar size, and they're arranged in a row with partial overlaps, then PO(x,z) can hold.

4. TPP(x,z) & NTPP(x,z): I'm trying to visualize a scenario where PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) holds, but x is a proper part of z. It seems challenging because if x is a proper part of z, and y overlaps with both, then y would have to be partly inside z and partly outside, which is consistent with PO(y,z). But then, how does x relate to the part of y that's outside z? If x is properly inside z, then it might not overlap with the part of y that's outside z, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, I'm unsure if TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) can hold in this scenario.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), the same reasoning applies with the roles of x and z reversed.

5. EQ(x,z): If y is a circle, and both x and z are identical circles that overlap with y in the same way, then EQ(x,z) can hold.

Let's reconsider.

Intuitively, partial overlaps chained together allow for any kind of relationship depending on how the overlaps are structured.

Actually, let me try a different approach using specific examples to see which relations are possible:

1. DC(x,z): 
   x = {1, 2, 3, 4}
   y = {3, 4, 5, 6}
   z = {5, 6, 7, 8}
   Here, x and y share {3, 4}, y and z share {5, 6}, but x and z are disjoint.

2. EC(x,z): 
   I'm not sure if we can represent "touching at a boundary" in this discrete set setting. In a continuous space, we could have regions that touch only at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): 
   x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   y = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
   z = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
   Here, x and y share {3, 4, 5}, y and z share {5, 6, 7}, and x and z share {5}.

4. TPP(x,z): 
   I'm not sure how to represent the "tangential" aspect in this context. It refers to touching at boundaries, which is more visual.

Let me try to reason about this using continuous 2D regions, which might be more intuitive for spatial relationships:

1. DC(x,z): 
   Imagine y as a wide horizontal oval. x is a circle that overlaps with the left half of y, and z is a circle that overlaps with the right half of y. If the left and right halves are far enough apart, x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): 
   Similar to the above, but the left and right halves of y are close enough such that x and z just touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): 
   x is a circle centered at the bottom-left of y, z is a circle centered at the bottom-right of y, and both circles extend below y and also into y, overlapping slightly with each other.

4. TPP(x,z): 
   z is a large circle. y is a smaller circle that overlaps partially with z, with a part of y outside z. x is an even smaller circle that is inside the intersection of y and z, but touching the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): 
   Similar to the above, but x is small enough that it's completely within z, not touching its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): 
   x is a large circle. y is a smaller circle that overlaps partially with x, with a part of y outside x. z is an even smaller circle that is inside the intersection of y and x, but touching the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): 
   Similar to the above, but z is small enough that it's completely within x, not touching its boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): 
   y is a circle that overlaps partially with both x and z, which are identical circles.

From these examples, it seems like all of the RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let's double-check this more carefully for the TPP and NTPP cases and their inverses.

For TPP(x,z):
We need x to be a proper part of z with x touching the boundary of z. We also need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

For PO(x,y), we need x and y to have a non-empty intersection, with neither being a part of the other. Since x is a part of z, the portion of y that lies outside z must overlap with x. But this contradicts the requirement that x is a part of z.

Hmm, actually, this is confusing me. Let me revisit.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z, touching its boundary. For PO(x,y), we need x to not be completely inside y, and y to not be completely inside x. For PO(y,z), we need y to not be completely inside z, and z to not be completely inside y.

I don't think there's an inherent contradiction here. For instance, x can be inside z, y can partially overlap with both x and z, extending outside of z. This would be consistent with both PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me try a concrete visualization again:

z is a large circle.
y is a circle that partially overlaps with z, with a part of y extending outside z.
x is a smaller circle inside z that touches the boundary of z. 
x overlaps with the part of y that's inside z, but since y extends outside z, and x is inside z, we still have PO(x,y) (they share a part, but neither is inside the other).

So, it seems like TPP(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, we can construct examples for NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z). And we've already established that DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are possible.

Therefore, all eight RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me double check using a graphical approach to be on the safe side.

Let's start from scratch. 
We have PO(x,y), i.e., x and y both have parts not shared between them and they also have a non-empty intersection.
We have PO(y,z), i.e., y and z both have parts not shared between them and they also have a non-empty intersection.

Let me now consider each of the 8 RCC-8 relations between x and z and see if it's consistent with the above.

1. DC(x,z):
In this case, x and z are disconnected. This means they don't share any parts. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)? 
Yes, it's possible for y to overlap with both x and z, but for x and z to not overlap each other. For example, y can be a long rectangle, with x overlapping with the left part of y and z overlapping with the right part of y, but x and z themselves don't overlap.

2. EC(x,z):
In this case, x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. The question is: Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)?
Yes, it's possible. Similar to the DC case, but now x and z touch at a boundary. For example, y is a long rectangle, and x and z are shapes that overlap with y and touch each other at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z):
In this case, x and z overlap, with both having parts not in the overlap. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)?
Yes, it's definitely possible. We can have three circles that all overlap partially with each other.

4. TPP(x,z):
In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z. The question is: Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)?
For PO(x,y), we need x and y to overlap partially. Since x is inside z, for y to overlap with both x and z, y would have to also overlap with z. However, since x touches the boundary of z, it's possible for y to overlap with x and also extend outside of z, which would satisfy PO(y,z).
So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)?
Similar to the TPP case, y can partially overlap with both x and z, and since x is wholly inside z, y would have to extend outside of z for PO(y,z) to hold.
So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
This is the inverse of TPP, so z is a tangential proper part of x. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)?
For PO(y,z), we need y and z to overlap partially. Since z is inside x, for y to overlap with both x and z, y would also have to overlap with x. Since z touches the boundary of x, it's possible for y to overlap with z and also extend outside of x, which would satisfy PO(x,y).
So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
This is the inverse of NTPP, so z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)?
Similar to the TPPi case, y can partially overlap with both x and z, and since z is wholly inside x, y would have to extend outside of x for PO(x,y) to hold.
So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
In this case, x and z are identical. Is this consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z)?
If x and z are identical, then PO(x,y) is the same as PO(z,y), which is the same as PO(y,z) (using the symmetry of PO). So, this is consistent. Let's verify. If we have a y such that PO(y,x) and x = z, then PO(y,z) holds as well. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is consistent with the given conditions.

So, it appears all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let's double-check the TPP, NTPP, and their inverses by drawing pictures to make sure.

For TPP(x,z):
Let's say z is a circular region and x is a smaller circular region inside z, touching z's boundary at one point. For PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we could have y as a region that overlaps with both x and z, and also extends outside z.
For example, if z is centered at the origin, and x is inside z touching its left boundary, then y can be a region centered somewhere to the left, overlapping partially with x and z, and also extending outside of z to the left. This would satisfy both PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

For NTPP(x,z):
Similar to the above, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):
These are the inverses of TPP and NTPP, so the reasoning is similar with the roles of x and z swapped.

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are identical, then the conditions PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are basically the same, so there's no inconsistency.

Given the reasoning above, I reaffirm that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relationship between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let's be a bit more rigorous and use the formal properties of the RCC-8 relations to double-check.

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y have a non-empty intersection: I(x, y) != ∅
- Neither is a part of the other: ¬P(x, y) ∧ ¬P(y, x)

PO(y,z) means:
- y and z have a non-empty intersection: I(y, z) != ∅
- Neither is a part of the other: ¬P(y, z) ∧ ¬P(z, y)

Now, let's consider each of the RCC-8 relations between x and z and see if they're consistent with the above:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z have an empty intersection. This can be consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) if y overlaps with both x and z, but x and z themselves don't overlap. A simple example would be three disks in a row, with the middle one (y) overlapping with the other two, but the other two don't overlap with each other. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but have no interior overlap. Using the analogy of disks, if we move the disks from the DC example slightly closer so that x and z touch at a boundary point, then we have EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z have a non-empty intersection, but neither is a part of the other. This is easy to visualize: three disks arranged such that each overlaps with the other two partially. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches its boundary). For this to be consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), we need to ensure that y partially overlaps with both x and z.
   Let's visualize: z is a large disk, x is a smaller disk inside z and touching its boundary at one point. Now, we need to place y such that it partially overlaps with both x and z, without being fully inside or outside of either. One way to do this is to place y such that it encompasses a part of x, a part of z, and also a part of the outside.
   So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is similar to the TPP case, but x is now strictly inside z and doesn't touch its boundary. The same y from the TPP case would work here as well. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of TPP, so z is inside x and touches its boundary. We can use a similar reasoning as in the TPP case, with the roles of x and z swapped. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so z is strictly inside x. Again, we can reason similarly to the NTPP case with the roles of x and z swapped. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. If x = z, then PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) refer to the same relationship. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, all eight RCC-8 relations are consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), which means they are all possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, let's double check my last analysis and make sure I didn't miss anything. 

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y have a non-empty intersection: I(x, y) != ∅
- Neither is a part of the other: ¬P(x, y) ∧ ¬P(y, x)

PO(y,z) means:
- y and z have a non-empty intersection: I(y, z) != ∅
- Neither is a part of the other: ¬P(y, z) ∧ ¬P(z, y)

I'll avoid the disk analogy and be more precise, maybe considering more specific regions.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z have no common points. We need y to overlap with both x and z, without causing an overlap between x and z.
   Let's define a specific example:
   y = {(a, b) | 1 ≤ a ≤ 4, 1 ≤ b ≤ 2}
   x = {(a, b) | 0 ≤ a ≤ 2, 0 ≤ b ≤ 3}
   z = {(a, b) | 3 ≤ a ≤ 5, 0 ≤ b ≤ 3}
   Here, x and y overlap in the region {(a, b) | 1 ≤ a ≤ 2, 1 ≤ b ≤ 2}. y and z overlap in the region {(a, b) | 3 ≤ a ≤ 4, 1 ≤ b ≤ 2}. But x and z don't overlap.
   So, DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z have common points only on their boundaries, not in their interiors.
   Let's define an example:
   y = {(a, b) | 1 ≤ a ≤ 4, 1 ≤ b ≤ 2}
   x = {(a, b) | 0 ≤ a ≤ 2.5, 0 ≤ b ≤ 3}
   z = {(a, b) | 2.5 ≤ a ≤ 5, 0 ≤ b ≤ 3}
   Here, x and y overlap, y and z overlap, and x and z share only the boundary line a = 2.5.
   So, EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is a part of the other.
   Let's define an example:
   y = {(a, b) | 1 ≤ a ≤ 4, 1 ≤ b ≤ 4}
   x = {(a, b) | 0 ≤ a ≤ 3, 0 ≤ b ≤ 3}
   z = {(a, b) | 2 ≤ a ≤ 5, 2 ≤ b ≤ 5}
   Here, x and y overlap, y and z overlap, and x and z also overlap in the region {(a, b) | 2 ≤ a ≤ 3, 2 ≤ b ≤ 3}. Neither x is a part of z nor z is a part of x.
   So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z, but touches its boundary.
   Let's define an example:
   z = {(a, b) | 0 ≤ a ≤ 5, 0 ≤ b ≤ 5}
   x = {(a, b) | 1 ≤ a ≤ 4, 1 ≤ b ≤ 5}
   y = {(a, b) | 2 ≤ a ≤ 6, 2 ≤ b ≤ 4}
   Here, x is inside z and touches its boundary at the line b = 5. y overlaps with both x and z, and extends outside of z. So we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).
   So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z, and doesn't touch its boundary.
   Let's modify the example slightly:
   z = {(a, b) | 0 ≤ a ≤ 5, 0 ≤ b ≤ 5}
   x = {(a, b) | 1 ≤ a ≤ 4, 1 ≤ b ≤ 4}
   y = {(a, b) | 2 ≤ a ≤ 6, 2 ≤ b ≤ 4}
   Here, x is inside z and doesn't touch its boundary. y overlaps with both x and z, and extends outside of z. So we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).
   So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x, but touches its boundary.
   Let's define an example:
   x = {(a, b) | 0 ≤ a ≤ 5, 0 ≤ b ≤ 5}
   z = {(a, b) | 1 ≤ a ≤ 4, 1 ≤ b ≤ 5}
   y = {(a, b) | 2 ≤ a ≤ 6, 2 ≤ b ≤ 4}
   Here, z is inside x and touches its boundary at the line b = 5. y overlaps with both x and z, and extends outside of x. So we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).
   So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x, and doesn't touch its boundary.
   x = {(a, b) | 0 ≤ a ≤ 5, 0 ≤ b ≤ 5}
   z = {(a, b) | 1 ≤ a ≤ 4, 1 ≤ b ≤ 4}
   y = {(a, b) | 2 ≤ a ≤ 6, 2 ≤ b ≤ 4}
   Here, z is inside x and doesn't touch its boundary. y overlaps with both x and z, and extends outside of x. So we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).
   So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical.
   Let's define an example:
   x = z = {(a, b) | 0 ≤ a ≤ 5, 0 ≤ b ≤ 5}
   y = {(a, b) | 3 ≤ a ≤ 7, 3 ≤ b ≤ 7}
   Here, x and z are identical. y overlaps with both, but neither is a part of the other. So we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).
   So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

Given the above, all eight RCC-8 relations are consistent with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). This means they are all possible relationships between x and z.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)
6. TPPi(x,z)
7. NTPPi(x,z)
8. EQ(x,z)

So, all of the RCC-8 relations are possible.

ANSWER:

I'll analyze the possible relationships between regions x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Remember that PO(x,y) means x and y share some spatial part, but neither is entirely contained within the other. Similarly for PO(y,z).

Let me check each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Imagine y as a long rectangle with x overlapping the left portion and z overlapping the right, with no overlap between x and z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. Similar to above, but x and z touch at a single boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. All three regions can partially overlap each other.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z touching its boundary, while y overlaps with both and extends outside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. Similar to TPP but x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x touching its boundary, while y overlaps with both and extends outside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. Similar to TPPi but z doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. x and z can be identical, with y partially overlapping both.
