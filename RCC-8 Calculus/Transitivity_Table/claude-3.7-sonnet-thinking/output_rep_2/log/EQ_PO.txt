PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We know that:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).
- PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other).

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same region in space. Therefore, x's relationship with any other region z would be the same as y's relationship with z.

Since we're told that PO(y,z), and x is equivalent to y, then x must also partially overlap with z.

So, the relationship between x and z would be PO(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. The definition of PO(y,z) is that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same spatial region. Therefore, x must also share the same spatial part with z that y does, and neither x nor z is part of the other. 

So, I confirm that the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me be more careful. 

EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region.
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. That is, they share some spatial part, but neither is a proper part of the other.

Given that x and y are coincident, any relationship y has with another region will be the same as the relationship x has with that region.

So, since y partially overlaps with z, and x is coincident with y, x must also partially overlap with z.

Therefore, the possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Let's double-check by thinking more broadly about the RCC-8 relations:

- DC(x,z) would mean x and z are disconnected. But since EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), this would imply y and z are disconnected, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

- EC(x,z) would mean x and z only touch at their boundaries. Again, this would imply y and z only touch at their boundaries, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

- PO(x,z) would mean x and z partially overlap. This is consistent with our derivation.

- TPP(x,z) would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This would imply y is a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, this would contradict PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

- TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This would imply z is a proper part of y, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this would contradict PO(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are coincident. But if x is coincident with y, and y partially overlaps with z, then x cannot be coincident with z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this exhaustive check, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this more carefully, because I'm thinking the relations between y and z, and between x and z, should be the same given that x and y are coincident.

From EQ(x,y), we know that x and y are coincident.
From PO(y,z), we know that y and z partially overlap.

Given that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space), any relationship y has with another region (in this case, z) will be identical to the relationship x has with that region.

So, since y partially overlaps with z, and x is coincident with y, x must also partially overlap with z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Let me double-check this once more using the property of substitution. If x and y are equivalent (EQ(x,y)), then I should be able to substitute x for y in any relationship.

Given:
- EQ(x,y)
- PO(y,z)

Using the property of substitution, I can replace y with x in the second relation:
- PO(x,z)

So, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me triple-check this. Here's what we know:

1. EQ(x,y): This means x and y are coincident, occupying exactly the same spatial region.
2. PO(y,z): This means y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is a proper part of the other.

If x and y are identical in their spatial extent (EQ(x,y)), then any spatial relationship y has with z should be the same as the relationship x has with z. This is because from the perspective of z, both x and y are the exact same spatial region.

So, if y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), then x should also partially overlap with z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

I think my initial answer is correct. The relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, let's be completely sure this time. Let's think more carefully.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy the exact same spatial region.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, meaning they share some part, but neither is fully contained within the other.

Since x and y are coincident, they are essentially the same region in space. This means that x's relationships with other regions will be identical to y's relationships with those regions.

So, if y has a relationship of partial overlap (PO) with z, then x will also have a relationship of partial overlap with z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, let's double-check this by analyzing the definitions more carefully, and using a bit more logic.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

From RCC-8, we know that these relations are mutually exclusive, meaning a pair of regions can only have one of these relationships. We also know they are exhaustive, meaning a pair of regions must have one of these relationships.

If x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), then they are essentially the same region from the perspective of any other region. So, if y has a certain relationship with z, then x should have the same relationship with z.

Since we're told that PO(y,z), and given the property of EQ(x,y), we can infer that PO(x,z) is the relationship between x and z.

To be absolutely sure, let's verify this with a bit more logical reasoning:

1. If x = y (which is what EQ(x,y) effectively means in terms of spatial regions), then for any relation R and any region z, R(y,z) ‚ü∫ R(x,z).
2. Since PO(y,z) is given, and based on point 1, we can infer PO(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let's be super careful to make sure we're defining the RCC-8 relations correctly. Here's a review:

- DC(a,b): a and b are disconnected (they don't share any part).
- EC(a,b): a and b are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts).
- PO(a,b): a and b partially overlap (they share some part, but neither is a proper part of the other).
- TPP(a,b): a is a tangential proper part of b (a is a proper part of b and touches b's boundary).
- NTPP(a,b): a is a non-tangential proper part of b (a is a proper part of b and doesn't touch b's boundary).
- TPPi(a,b): b is a tangential proper part of a (equivalent to TPP(b,a)).
- NTPPi(a,b): b is a non-tangential proper part of a (equivalent to NTPP(b,a)).
- EQ(a,b): a and b are equal (they are the same region).

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

If x and y are the same region, then any relationship y has with another region (like z) will be the same as the relationship x has with that region. So, since y partially overlaps with z, x must also partially overlap with z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

But to triple check ourselves, let's once again go through all of the 8 possible RCC-8 relations to make sure PO(x,z) is the only logically possible one:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. But since EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), we know y and z share a common part. Since x and y are the same region, x must also share this common part with z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. But for y and z, we know they don't just touch at their boundaries; they overlap. Since x and y are the same region, x must also overlap with z and not just touch at the boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is consistent with our reasoning based on EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z).

- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary. But since x and y are the same region, and y is not fully contained within z (from PO(y,z)), TPP(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to the above, this is not possible because y (which is the same as x) is not fully contained within z.

- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is fully contained within x and touches x's boundary. But since y (which is the same as x) does not fully contain z (from PO(y,z)), TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the above, this is not possible because y (which is the same as x) does not fully contain z.

- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. But since y (which is the same as x) partially overlaps with z and doesn't coincide with it (from PO(y,z)), EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this exhaustive check, the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

In summary, if EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), then the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

OK, just once more, let me make absolutely sure that PO(y,z) means that neither is a proper part of the other (that is, a proper part plus something else).

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. This means there's a region common to both y and z, but there are also parts of y that are not in z, and parts of z that are not in y. In other words, neither y nor z is a proper part of the other. There's an overlap, but also parts unique to each.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

Since x and y are the same region, x's relationship with any other region must be the same as y's relationship with that region. Since y partially overlaps with z, x must also partially overlap with z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

I'm confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible spatial relationship between x and z, given EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial part, but neither is contained within the other)

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are identical spatial regions. This means any spatial relationship that y has with another region will be identical to the relationship x has with that region.

Given that y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), and x is identical to y, then x must also partially overlap with z.

Let me verify this is the only possible relationship by checking all options:
- DC, EC: Not possible since x must share parts with z (as y does)
- TPP, NTPP: Not possible since x cannot be contained in z (as y isn't)
- TPPi, NTPPi: Not possible since z cannot be contained in x (as z isn't in y)
- EQ: Not possible since y and z aren't coincident

### Answer: PO(x,z)
