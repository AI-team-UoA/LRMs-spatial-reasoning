PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step. I need to determine what the possible relationships between x and z can be, given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

First, let me recall the meaning of each relation:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts

Given that EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries but do not overlap in their interiors.
Given that DC(y,z), we know that y and z are completely disconnected.

Now I need to determine what relations can hold between x and z. Since y and z are disconnected, and x only touches y at the boundary, it's possible that:

1. x and z are also disconnected, so DC(x,z) is possible.
2. x and z could touch at their boundaries without sharing interior parts, so EC(x,z) is possible.
3. x and z could partially overlap, so PO(x,z) is possible.
4. x could be a tangential proper part of z, so TPP(x,z) is possible.
5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z) is possible.
6. z could be a tangential proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.
7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.
8. x and z could be equal, so EQ(x,z) is possible.

Wait, let me think more carefully about this. Given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), there are some constraints on the possible relations between x and z.

If y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), and x touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), then x and z could be:

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. x could be entirely on the side of y that's away from z.
2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x could touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part.
3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x could overlap with z while still touching y at the boundary.
4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x could be a proper part of z that touches z's boundary, while still touching y at the boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): This might be problematic. If x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, how can it touch y, which is disconnected from z? But on second thought, it's possible if x touches y at the boundary and is completely contained within z, not touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary, while x also touches y at its boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, while x touches y at its boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): This is problematic. If x and z are identical, and x touches y, then z must also touch y, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Let me double-check my reasoning for each of these:

1. DC(x,z): Definitely possible.
2. EC(x,z): Definitely possible.
3. PO(x,z): Definitely possible.

For the remaining cases, I need to be more careful:

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. But since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This seems to create a contradiction: if x is inside z and touches y, then y and z must also touch, contradicting DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is entirely contained in z and does not touch z's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. But since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This creates the same contradiction as in the TPP case. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This is possible if z touches x's boundary at a different location than where x touches y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is entirely contained in x and does not touch x's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is completely inside x, away from x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. But since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This creates a contradiction: if x and z are the same, and x touches y, then z must also touch y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me revise my conclusions:

Possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z):
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Not possible:
1. TPP(x,z)
2. NTPP(x,z)
3. EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me double check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, and EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary and is entirely contained within z, touching z's boundary. Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. 

Wait, there is no contradiction here. x can be a tangential proper part of z and touch y at a part of its boundary that is also part of z's boundary. In other words, x can touch both y and z at the same boundary point. This doesn't violate DC(y,z) because y and z themselves don't share any parts; they are merely both touched by x at the boundary.

No, I'm making an error here. If x touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)) and x is part of z (TPP(x,z)), then some part of x's boundary is part of z's boundary. If x touches y at a point on this shared boundary, then y must also touch z at this point, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Actually, let me think about this differently. Here's a simple example: Imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle entirely contained within z, and y as a circle outside of z but touching x at a point. In this case, we have TPP(x,z) and EC(x,y). But since x is inside z and touches y, and y is outside z, y must also touch z, contradicting DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary. Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary. But since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected.

This creates a contradiction: if x is inside z, not touching z's boundary, and x touches y, then y must penetrate z to touch x, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

Let me revise my conclusions:

Possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z):
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I'm still not being careful enough. Let me think through TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) one more time.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- EC(x,y): x touches y at the boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y at the boundary, then there are two possibilities:
1. x touches y at a point on its boundary that is not on z's boundary. But this would mean y penetrates z to touch x, which contradicts DC(y,z).
2. x touches y at a point on its boundary that is also on z's boundary. But this would mean y and z touch at this point, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- EC(x,y): x touches y at the boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

If x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, and x touches y at the boundary, then y must penetrate z to touch x, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So, NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

Let me revise my conclusions once more:

Possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z):
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Not possible:
1. TPP(x,z)
2. NTPP(x,z)
3. EQ(x,z)

Let me examine the possible ones even more carefully to make sure:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x touches y at the boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

This is possible. x can touch y at the boundary, and both x and y can be disconnected from z.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
- EC(x,y): x touches y at the boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

This is possible. x can touch both y and z at different parts of its boundary, while y and z remain disconnected.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- EC(x,y): x touches y at the boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

This is possible. x can overlap with z while also touching y at a part of its boundary that does not overlap with z. And y and z can remain disconnected.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EC(x,y): x touches y at the boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

This is possible. z can be inside x, touching x's boundary at one part, while x touches y at a different part of its boundary. And y and z can remain disconnected.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EC(x,y): x touches y at the boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected.

This is possible. z can be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, while x touches y at its boundary. And y and z can remain disconnected.

It appears that my revised conclusions are correct. Given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

And the not possible ones are:
1. TPP(x,z)
2. NTPP(x,z)
3. EQ(x,z)

Let me formulate the final answer in the required format:

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z given the constraints:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (share no spatial parts)

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at the boundary while being completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch y at one part of its boundary and touch z at another part, with y and z remaining disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z while still touching y at a boundary point that doesn't overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y, then y would have to either penetrate z or touch z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, it can't simultaneously touch y without y penetrating z, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be contained in x and touch x's boundary at one location, while x touches y at a different boundary location.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely contained within x (not touching x's boundary), while x touches y at its boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are identical, and x touches y, then z must also touch y, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
