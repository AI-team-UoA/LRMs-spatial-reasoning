PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We have that DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts. NTPP(y,z) means that y is part of z, but does not touch z's boundary.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's think through the constraints systematically.

DC(x,y) tells us that x and y do not share any points. They are completely disconnected.

NTPP(y,z) tells us that y is a strict subset of z (a proper part), and y is completely in the interior of z. That is, y does not touch z's boundary.

So what could be the relationship between x and z? Let's go through each of the possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x does not intersect at all with z. Since y is strictly inside z, and x is disconnected from y, it's possible for x to be outside of z entirely. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): EC means that x touches z at the boundary but does not overlap with z's interior. Since y is properly inside z (i.e., y doesn't touch z's boundary), and x is disconnected from y, it's possible for x to touch z at the boundary without intersecting y. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): PO means that x partially overlaps with z; they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. It's possible for x to overlap with a part of z that doesn't contain y. Since y is properly inside z, there's room for x to overlap with z without touching y. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): TPP means that x is a tangential proper part of z; x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. It's possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z without intersecting y, since y doesn't touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): NTPP means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z; x is contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary. It's possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z without intersecting y, since y doesn't fill all of z's interior. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): TPPi means that z is a tangential proper part of x; z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible, because y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), which means y is contained in z's interior. But we know that DC(x,y), so x and y don't share any points. This means x cannot contain z, because if it did, it would also contain y, contradicting DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): NTPPi means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x; z is contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. By the same reasoning as for TPPi, this is not possible. If z were contained in x, then y would also be contained in x (since y is contained in z), contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): EQ means that x and z are the same region. This is not possible, because if x and z were the same, then since y is inside z, y would also be inside x. But we're given that DC(x,y), so y cannot be inside x. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me double-check. We are given that:
DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.
NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z; y is contained in z's interior and doesn't touch z's boundary.

We have that the possible relations between x and z are:
DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
EC(x,z): x touches z at the boundary but does not overlap with z's interior.
PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's analyze these possibilities again to make sure they're consistent with the given relations.

DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then x and y are also disconnected because y is inside z. This is consistent with DC(x,y).

EC(x,z): If x touches z at the boundary, then x doesn't overlap with z's interior. Since y is inside z's interior, x doesn't overlap with y. This is consistent with DC(x,y).

PO(x,z): If x partially overlaps with z, then x contains some points in z and some points outside z. The points of x inside z must not overlap with y, since DC(x,y). This is possible because y is a proper part of z, so z has other points besides those in y. So x can overlap with z in the areas that don't contain y.

TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. For this to be consistent with DC(x,y), x and y must not overlap, even though they're both inside z. This is possible because y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so there's room in z for x to be a tangential proper part without overlapping with y.

NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is contained in z's interior. For this to be consistent with DC(x,y), x and y must not overlap, even though they're both inside z's interior. This is possible because y doesn't fill all of z's interior, so there's room for x to be inside z without overlapping with y.

So the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP. Let me check once more to make sure.

Another way to think about it: we know that NTPP(y,z), so y is contained in z's interior. We also know that DC(x,y), so x doesn't intersect with y at all. This means that x cannot contain any part of y. So x must either be outside z (DC), touch z's boundary without intersecting its interior (EC), overlap partially with z but not with y (PO), be contained in z and touch z's boundary but not overlap with y (TPP), or be contained in z's interior but not overlap with y (NTPP). So all of those are possible.

On the other hand, x cannot contain z (so TPPi and NTPPi are ruled out), because if it did, it would also contain y (which is part of z), contradicting DC(x,y). And x cannot be the same as z (so EQ is ruled out), because if it were, it would contain y, again contradicting DC(x,y).

So the answer is that the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Hmm, let me check one more time. In particular, I want to double-check if TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are truly possible.

TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is properly contained in z and touches z's boundary. We know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is properly contained in z's interior. We also know that x and y are disconnected, so they have no common points. The question is whether x can be inside z without overlapping with y. 

I think this is possible as long as z is large enough. For instance, imagine z as a large disk, y as a small disk in the center of z, and x as a small disk near the boundary of z. Then x is a tangential proper part of z, y is a non-tangential proper part of z, and x and y are disconnected.

Similar reasoning applies to NTPP(x,z). Imagine z as a large disk, y as a small disk in the center of z, and x as a small disk inside z but not touching z's boundary and not overlapping with y. Then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, y is a non-tangential proper part of z, and x and y are disconnected.

So I confirm that the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me check this with a different approach to make sure.

We are given that:
DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.
NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z; y is contained in z's interior and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's go through each of the eight possible relations and check if it's consistent with the given information.

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. If x and z are disconnected, then x and y are also disconnected, since y is inside z. This is consistent with DC(x,y). So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

EC(x,z): x touches z at the boundary without overlapping z's interior. If x touches z at the boundary without overlapping z's interior, then x and y are disconnected, since y is inside z's interior. This is consistent with DC(x,y). So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

PO(x,z): x partly overlaps with z. If x partly overlaps with z, then x could overlap with parts of z that don't include y. This is consistent with DC(x,y), since y is a proper part of z, so z contains points that are not in y. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is contained in z and touches z's boundary, and y is contained in z's interior, then x and y can be disconnected as long as z is large enough. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is contained in z's interior, and y is also contained in z's interior, then x and y can be disconnected as long as z's interior is large enough. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is contained in x and touches x's boundary, then y is also contained in x (since y is inside z). But this contradicts DC(x,y), which states that x and y are disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is contained in x's interior, then y is also contained in x's interior (since y is inside z). But this contradicts DC(x,y), which states that x and y are disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relation.

EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then y is inside x (since y is inside z). But this contradicts DC(x,y), which states that x and y are disconnected. So EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

So in summary, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touch at the boundary)
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

These five relations are all consistent with the given information, and the other three relations (TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ) are ruled out because they would require x to contain y, which contradicts DC(x,y).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given DC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and is fully in z's interior (not touching z's boundary).

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be completely outside z while y is inside z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z's boundary without intersecting y (which is in z's interior).

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap with z in regions that don't contain y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z, touching z's boundary, without overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z without overlapping with y (z just needs to be large enough).

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were a proper part of x, then y would also be part of x (since y is part of z), contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be part of x, contradicting DC(x,y).
