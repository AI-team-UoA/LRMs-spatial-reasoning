PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

This question is asking for the possible RCC-8 spatial relations between regions x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's think about what these constraints mean:

1. TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is completely contained in y, and x touches the boundary of y.

2. PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some common region, but neither is contained in the other.

Now, to determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to consider all possible configurations that satisfy the given constraints.

Since TPP(x,y), we know that x is entirely within y and touches y's boundary.
Since PO(y,z), we know that y and z share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) (disconnected): Is it possible that x and z don't share any points? Since x is within y and touches y's boundary, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) (externally connected): Is it possible that x and z touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points? Since x is contained in y and touches y's boundary, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that x touches the boundary of z exactly at a point where y's boundary also touches z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) (partially overlapping): Is it possible that x and z share some common region, but neither is contained in the other? Since x is fully within y, and y and z partially overlap, it's possible that part of x overlaps with the part of z that also overlaps with y. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part): Is it possible that x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary? Given the constraints, this is possible if the region where x touches y's boundary is also on z's boundary (and of course, z overlaps with y in a way that includes x). So, TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part): Is it possible that x is fully contained in z without touching z's boundary? Given the constraints, this is possible if z overlaps with y in a way that includes x entirely, and the part of z's boundary that would be close to x is beyond the region of y that contains x, so x can't touch z's boundary while still being TPP to y. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x): This implies that z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. But this conflicts with TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), because if z is inside x, and x is inside y, then z is inside y, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x): Similar to TPPi, this implies that z is fully contained within x without touching x's boundary. But again, this conflicts with TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) for the same reasons as TPPi. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) (x and z are equal): This implies that x and z occupy the same region. But if TPP(x,y) and x = z, then TPP(z,y), which contradicts PO(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me double-check by considering some concrete examples:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine y as a large circle, x as a small circle touching the inside of y's boundary, and z as another circle that overlaps with y but doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): Imagine y as a large circle, x as a small circle touching the inside of y's boundary at a point, and z as another circle that overlaps with y and just touches x at that same boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): Imagine y as a large circle, x as a small circle touching the inside of y's boundary, and z as another circle that overlaps with both y and x (overlapping part of x but not all of it).

4. TPP(x,z): Imagine y as a large circle, x as a small circle touching the inside of y's boundary at a point, and z as another circle that contains x, overlaps with y, and shares the same boundary point where x touches y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Imagine y as a large circle, x as a small circle touching the inside of y's boundary, and z as a large circle that completely contains x, overlaps with y, but extends beyond y in a way that x doesn't touch z's boundary.

Wait, I need to be careful in thinking about this. Let me re-examine the constraints.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y.
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap.

Let's go through each of the 8 basic RCC-8 relations again:

1. DC(x,z) (disconnected): For x and z to be disconnected, they must not share any points. If TPP(x,y), then x is fully inside y (touching y's boundary). If PO(y,z), then y and z share some region. It's possible that this shared region doesn't include any part of x, so DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z) (externally connected): For x and z to be externally connected, they must touch at a boundary but not share any interior points. Given TPP(x,y), x touches the boundary of y. If PO(y,z), the boundary of z could intersect with y at a point where x is also touching the boundary of y. In this case, x and z would touch at that point without sharing interior points. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z) (partially overlapping): For x and z to partially overlap, they must share some interior points, but neither should be fully contained in the other. Given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), it's possible that z overlaps with the part of y where x is, causing x and z to share some regions, but not in a way that one is fully contained in the other. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) (tangential proper part): For TPP(x,z), x must be fully contained in z and must touch the boundary of z. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with z includes the entire x, and the boundary of z aligns with the boundary of y where x is touching it. So, TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) (non-tangential proper part): For NTPP(x,z), x must be fully contained in z without touching the boundary of z. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with z includes the entire x, but the boundary of z doesn't align with the boundary of y where x is touching it. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Now, for the inverses and equality:

6. TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x): For TPPi(x,z), z must be fully contained in x and touch the boundary of x. However, given TPP(x,y), x is fully within y. If TPPi(x,z), then z is fully within x, which means z is fully within y. This conflicts with PO(y,z), which says that y and z only partially overlap. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x): Similar to TPPi, for NTPPi(x,z), z must be fully contained within x without touching the boundary of x. But this again conflicts with PO(y,z) for the same reasons. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) (x and z are equal): For EQ(x,z), x and z must occupy the same region. Given TPP(x,y), x is strictly smaller than y. If EQ(x,z), then z is also strictly smaller than y, which conflicts with PO(y,z) (as PO implies neither is fully contained in the other). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

After re-analysis, I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z (given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z)) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, let me check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z). If TPPi(x,z), then z is fully contained in x and touches the boundary of x. If TPP(x,y), then x is fully within y and touches the boundary of y.

Wait, being contained in the proper part doesn't necessarily means being fully contained in the whole. Let me re-examine this case.

If TPPi(x,z), then z is fully contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Given TPP(x,y), we know that x is fully contained in y and touches the boundary of y.

Now, let's check if TPPi(x,z) is consistent with PO(y,z):
If TPPi(x,z), then z is inside x. If TPP(x,y), then x is inside y, which means z is also inside y. But this conflicts with PO(y,z), as PO implies that neither is fully contained in the other.

So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

Similarly for NTPPi(x,z):
If NTPPi(x,z), then z is inside x without touching x's boundary. Given TPP(x,y), x is inside y, which means z is also inside y. Again, this conflicts with PO(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

And for EQ(x,z):
If EQ(x,z), then x and z occupy the same region. Given TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. If x = z, then z is also inside y and touches y's boundary. But this means TPP(z,y), which conflicts with PO(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z (given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z)) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Reasoning once more through the five possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of y, and y and z partially overlap. It's possible that the part of y where x resides does not overlap with z, making x and z disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x touches the boundary of y, and y and z partially overlap. It's possible that x and z share a point on the boundary of y and z, but don't otherwise overlap, making them externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): z overlaps with y in a way that causes z to overlap with part, but not all, of x.

4. TPP(x,z): z overlaps with y in a way that includes all of x, and x touches the boundary of z exactly where it touches the boundary of y.

5. NTPP(x,z): z overlaps with y in a way that includes all of x, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z (the boundary of z lies outside the part of y where x touches the boundary of y).

These five relationships are all possible, and they are all distinct. So the answer is:

DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's try to visualize these scenarios to check our reasoning once more:

1. DC(x,z): Picture y as a large circle. Within y, there's a smaller circle x that touches the boundary of y at a point. Now, imagine z as another circle that overlaps with y, but doesn't include any part of x. Here, x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Similar to the above, but now z is positioned such that it just touches x at a point, which is also on the boundary of y. Here, x and z are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): Same setup as above, but z is positioned such that it partially overlaps with x. Some part of x is in z, and some part of x is not in z. Here, x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): y is a large circle, x is a smaller circle touching the boundary of y at a point. Now, z is a circle that contains x, overlaps with y (but doesn't contain all of y), and the boundary of z passes through the point where x touches the boundary of y. Here, x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to the above, but z is positioned such that x doesn't touch the boundary of z. Here, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

All of these scenarios maintain TPP(x,y) (x is a tangential proper part of y) and PO(y,z) (y and z partially overlap). So it seems like our reasoning holds.

To conclude, the possible relationships between x and z (given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z)) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine all possible RCC-8 spatial relations between regions x and z, given that:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and touches y's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some area but neither contains the other)

I'll analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible: x can be in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z at all.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible: x can touch z's boundary at a single point (where x also touches y's boundary) without sharing interior points.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible: x and z can share some interior points while neither completely contains the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible: x can be completely inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible: x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible: If z were contained in x, then z would be completely contained in y (since x is in y), contradicting PO(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible: Same reasoning as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible: If x equals z, then z would be a tangential proper part of y, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
