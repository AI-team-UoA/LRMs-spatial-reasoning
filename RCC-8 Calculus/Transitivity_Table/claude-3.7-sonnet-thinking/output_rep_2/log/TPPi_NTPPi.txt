PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this logically:

1. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

2. NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, y properly contains z, and z does not touch y's boundary.

Now, I need to determine what the relationship between x and z could be, given these two facts.

Since y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and z is a proper part of y (from NTPPi(y,z)), by transitivity, z must be a proper part of x.

Does z touch x's boundary? Since z does not touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)), and y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), z is "nested" within y, which is in turn within x but touching x's boundary. This means z is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

This corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I need to be careful here. The question is asking for the relation between x and z, not z and x.

So, if NTPP(z,x), then the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this:

- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So y is contained within x, touching x's boundary, and z is contained entirely within y, not touching y's boundary.

From x's perspective, what is its relation to z? 

x contains y, and y contains z, so x contains z (transitivity). 

Now, does z touch x's boundary? Since z doesn't even touch y's boundary, and y is inside x, z definitely doesn't touch x's boundary. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x).

But I'm asked for the relation between x and z, not z and x.

If NTPP(z,x), then the inverse relation is NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me triple-check this to be sure.

If TPPi(x,y), then TPP(y,x).
If NTPPi(y,z), then NTPP(z,y).

Now, we have:
- TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since y is a proper part of x and z is a proper part of y, by transitivity, z is a proper part of x.

Now, is z tangential or non-tangential to x?

Since z is non-tangential to y (from NTPP(z,y)), and y is tangential to x (from TPP(y,x)), z must be non-tangential to x. This is because z is "deeply nested" within y, which is already inside x. So z cannot touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relation between z and x is NTPP(z,x), and the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I just realized I made an error in my reasoning. Let's be more systematic.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, what's the relation between x and z?

Clearly, z is inside x (transitivity of containment). But does z touch x's boundary?

Let's think about this geometrically. z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. y is inside x and touches x's boundary. This means z is "deeply nested" inside x and cannot touch x's boundary.

So, z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which means NTPP(z,x). The inverse of this is NTPPi(x,z).

So the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be careful here. Let's think of it in terms of the inverse relations:

- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, the question is: given that y is a tangential proper part of x and z is a non-tangential proper part of y, what is the relation between x and z?

z is contained in y, which is in turn contained in x. So, z is definitely contained in x.

Does z touch the boundary of x? z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x. Since z is "deeply nested" inside y, it cannot reach the boundary of x.

So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x).

The inverse of NTPP(z,x) is NTPPi(x,z), which means x contains z as a non-tangential proper part.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm making this too complicated and potentially making a mistake. Let's simplify:

- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since y is contained in x and z is contained in y, z is contained in x (by transitivity).

Now, the key question is: does z touch the boundary of x? Let's think about this:

- y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).
- z does not touch the boundary of y (from NTPPi(y,z)).

Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, z is "deeply nested" inside x and cannot reach x's boundary.

So, the relation between z and x is NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The question, however, asks for the relation between x and z, not z and x. The inverse of NTPP(z,x) is NTPPi(x,z), which means x contains z as a non-tangential proper part.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I keep repeating the same thought and the same error, so let's just sort this out once and for all.

- TPPi(x, y): y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is the inverse of TPP, so it means TPP(y, x), where y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z, y), where z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, the givens are:
- TPP(y, x): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z, y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, I need to determine the relation between x and z.

Given:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, z is inside x (transitivity). But does z touch x's boundary?

Since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, z is "deeply nested" inside x and cannot touch x's boundary. So, the relation between z and x is NTPP(z, x).

The question asks for the relation between x and z, which is the inverse of the relation between z and x. The inverse of NTPP(z, x) is NTPPi(x, z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x, z). When we say NTPPi(x, z), we're saying that x is the container and z is the contained object, and z doesn't touch x's boundary.

Actually, I might have consistently made an error in my reasoning, so let's try a more direct approach:

- TPPi(x, y) means TPP(y, x), where y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y, z) means NTPP(z, y), where z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, we have:
- y is a tangential proper part of x.
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

This means:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

From this, we can infer:
- z is inside x (transitivity).
- z doesn't touch x's boundary (since it doesn't even touch y's boundary, which is already inside x).

So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z, x). The inverse of this relation is NTPPi(x, z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, I think I might still be confusing myself. Let's go back to basics and make sure I understand the relations correctly:

- TPP(a, b) means that a is a tangential proper part of b. In other words, a is inside b and touches b's boundary.
- NTPP(a, b) means that a is a non-tangential proper part of b. In other words, a is inside b and doesn't touch b's boundary.
- TPPi(a, b) is the inverse of TPP(a, b), so it means TPP(b, a). In other words, b is a tangential proper part of a.
- NTPPi(a, b) is the inverse of NTPP(a, b), so it means NTPP(b, a). In other words, b is a non-tangential proper part of a.

Now, the given information:
- TPPi(x, y) means TPP(y, x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y, z) means NTPP(z, y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

This means z is inside x (transitivity), and z doesn't touch x's boundary (since it's inside y, which is inside x).

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z, x). The inverse of this relation is NTPPi(x, z), which is the relation between x and z.

So, the answer is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, I finally realize, the question the answer could have multiple possible relations, not just one. So let's think more carefully.

Given:
- TPPi(x, y) means TPP(y, x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y, z) means NTPP(z, y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

What we can infer directly:
- z is inside x (transitivity of containment).
- y is tangential to x's boundary, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, z must be nested inside x. But does z necessarily not touch x's boundary?

Let's think geometrically:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary at some point(s).
- z is inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

For z to touch x's boundary, it would have to touch y's boundary first (since y is between z and x), which contradicts the given NTPPi(y, z). So, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z, x). The relation between x and z is the inverse, which is NTPPi(x, z).

So, the only possible relation between x and z given the conditions is NTPPi(x, z). No other relations are compatible with the given constraints.

Actually, let me double check the definitions to make sure I have them right:

TPP(a, b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. This means a is inside b and touches b's boundary.

TPPi(a, b) means b is a tangential proper part of a. This means b is inside a and touches a's boundary.

NTPP(a, b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b. This means a is inside b and doesn't touch b's boundary.

NTPPi(a, b) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a. This means b is inside a and doesn't touch a's boundary.

Now, let's again work through the given information:

TPPi(x, y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

NTPPi(y, z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, y is inside x and z is inside y. By transitivity, z is inside x.

Now, does z touch x's boundary? For z to touch x's boundary, it would have to extend to touch y's boundary first, and then y would need to touch x's boundary at that same point. But we're told that z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. So, z is entirely contained within y and doesn't reach y's boundary. Therefore, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Since z is inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary, the relation between z and x is NTPP(z, x). The relation between x and z, which is what the question asks for, is the inverse: NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, as a double-check (because I keep second-guessing myself), here's a simple way to think about it:

- y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, z is "deeply nested" inside x and cannot touch x's boundary, which means NTPP(z, x) or, from the perspective of the question, NTPPi(x, z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, I'm going to try to find a visualization to help sort this out:

Let's visualize this with circles:
- x is the largest circle.
- y is a circle inside x, touching x's boundary at some point.
- z is a circle inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Clearly, z is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

This also confirms that NTPPi(x, z) is the only possible relation given the constraints.

Actually, let me carefully visualize all the RCC-8 relations to make sure I don't miss any:

1. DC(a, b): a and b are disconnected; they don't overlap and don't touch.
2. EC(a, b): a and b externally connected; they touch at a boundary but don't overlap.
3. PO(a, b): a and b partially overlap; they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(a, b): a is a tangential proper part of b; a is inside b and touches b's boundary.
5. NTPP(a, b): a is a non-tangential proper part of b; a is inside b and doesn't touch b's boundary.
6. TPPi(a, b): b is a tangential proper part of a; b is inside a and touches a's boundary.
7. NTPPi(a, b): b is a non-tangential proper part of a; b is inside a and doesn't touch a's boundary.
8. EQ(a, b): a and b are equal; they occupy the same space.

Given:
- TPPi(x, y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, let's go through each relation to see if it's possible between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This would mean x and z don't overlap and don't touch. But we know z is inside y, which is inside x, so z must be inside x. Therefore, DC(x, z) is not possible.

2. EC(x, z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. But for this to happen, z would have to touch x's boundary. However, z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Since y is between z and x in this sense, z can't touch x's boundary if it doesn't touch y's. Therefore, EC(x, z) is not possible.

3. PO(x, z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, but neither is contained within the other. But we know z is inside y, which is inside x, so z must be entirely inside x. Therefore, PO(x, z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x, z): This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But we know y is inside x, and z is inside y, so z is inside x, not the other way around. Therefore, TPP(x, z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x, z): This would mean x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, z is inside x, not the other way around. Therefore, NTPP(x, z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x, z): This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But for z to touch x's boundary, it would have to touch y's boundary first (since y is between z and x), which contradicts the given NTPPi(y, z). Therefore, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This would mean z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with our visualization: z is inside y, y is inside x, and z doesn't touch y's boundary, so z can't touch x's boundary. Therefore, NTPPi(x, z) is possible.

8. EQ(x, z): This would mean x and z occupy the same space. But we know z is inside y, which is inside x, so z is a proper part of x, not equal to it. Therefore, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

In summary, only NTPPi(x, z) is a possible relation between x and z given the constraints.

OK looks like the answer is: NTPPi(x, z)

Actually, just to be 100% sure, let's make sure I understand the given relations correctly:

- TPPi(x, y) means TPP(y, x), which means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y, z) means NTPP(z, y), which means z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let me visualize this one more time:
- x is a region.
- y is a region inside x, touching x's boundary at some point.
- z is a region inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z. Since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is inside x (transitivity). But does z touch x's boundary? For z to touch x's boundary, z would have to extend to the boundary of y, and then y would have to touch x's boundary at that point. But we're told z doesn't touch y's boundary, so z is "deeply nested" inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z, x). The relation from x to z, which is what the question asks for, is the inverse: NTPPi(x, z).

This is the only possible relation between x and z given the conditions, as we've verified by checking each of the eight RCC-8 relations.

So, the answer is: NTPPi(x, z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to understand what these relationships mean and then determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's analyze what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

1) Since y is inside x, and z is inside y, by transitivity, z must be inside x.

2) Does z touch the boundary of x? For z to touch x's boundary, it would have to touch y's boundary first (since y is between z and x). However, we know z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)). Therefore, z cannot touch x's boundary.

3) Since z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, the relationship must be NTPPi(x,z).

Let me verify by checking if any other RCC-8 relation is possible:
- DC, EC: Impossible as z is inside x
- PO: Impossible as z is completely inside x
- TPP, NTPP: Impossible as x contains z, not the other way around
- TPPi: Impossible as z doesn't touch x's boundary
- EQ: Impossible as z is a proper part of x

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
