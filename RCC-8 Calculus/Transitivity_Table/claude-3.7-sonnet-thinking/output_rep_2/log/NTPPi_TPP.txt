PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what we know:
1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This is the same as NTPP(y,x).
2. TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now we want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about this spatially. 
- y is a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary, so y is strictly in the interior of x.
- y is also a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. 

To work out the possible relationships between x and z, I'll consider the relative sizes and positions of these regions.

Since y is inside both x and z, there's definitely some overlap between x and z. So x and z cannot be DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected).

Let's consider all possible relationships:

1. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if part of z extends outside of x, and part of x extends outside of z.
2. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely within z and touches z's boundary.
3. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
4. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely within x and touches x's boundary.
5. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
6. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is possible if x and z occupy the same region.

So I need to check each of these possibilities.

First, I'll check PO(x,z). 
Given NTPPi(x,y), y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If there's partial overlap between x and z, then some part of z is outside x. But y is inside both x and z, and y touches z's boundary. So at least part of z's boundary must extend outside of x, which is consistent with PO(x,z). So PO(x,z) is possible.

Next, I'll check TPP(x,z).
If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then all of x (including y) would be inside z. Since y touches z's boundary, x would also have to touch z's boundary. Since NTPPi(x,y) means y is strictly inside x, this seems plausible.

Next, NTPP(x,z).
If x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then all of x (including y) would be inside z, and x would not touch z's boundary. But we know TPP(y,z), which means y touches z's boundary. If y touches z's boundary and y is inside x, then x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Next, TPPi(x,z).
If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, then all of z (including y) would be inside x, and z would touch x's boundary. But we know NTPPi(x,y), which means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is a problem, because we also know TPP(y,z), which means y touches z's boundary. If y touches z's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary, and z touches x's boundary, that suggests z extends beyond y in a way that reaches x's boundary. But this doesn't seem possible if all of z is inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me rethink this. Actually, maybe TPPi(x,z) is possible. If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, and y is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary, then y could still be contained well inside x, not touching x's boundary. Let me try to visualize this: imagine x is a large circle, z is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at one point, and y is an even smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point away from where z touches x. Then NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would both be true, and also TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me try once more, because I'm not convinced. TPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary. TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z that touches z's boundary. 

Let me imagine x is a circle, and y is a smaller circle inside it, not touching its boundary. For TPP(y,z), z is some region that contains y and y touches z's boundary. For TPPi(x,z), z must be inside x and touch x's boundary.

Actually, yes this is possible. Imagine x is a large circle, z is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at one point, and y is an even smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point away from where z touches x.

Next, NTPPi(x,z).
If z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then all of z (including y) would be inside x, and z would not touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y), which means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. And it's consistent with TPP(y,z), which means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. All three of these can be true at the same time. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Last, EQ(x,z).
If x and z are equal, then they occupy the same region. But we know NTPPi(x,y), which means y is strictly inside x, and we know TPP(y,z), which means y touches the boundary of z. These can't both be true if x and z are the same region, because then y would have to both touch and not touch the boundary of the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check each of these to make sure I haven't made a mistake.

PO(x,z): X and Z partially overlap. 
NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly inside x.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
For PO(x,z), some of x is outside z, and some of z is outside x. Given that y is inside both, this is possible.

TPP(x,z): X is a tangential proper part of Z.
NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly inside x.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
For TPP(x,z), all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside both and touches z's boundary, this is possible.

TPPi(x,z): Z is a tangential proper part of X.
NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly inside x.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
For TPPi(x,z), all of z is inside x, and z touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside z, so y is also inside x. y touches z's boundary, and z touches x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): Z is a non-tangential proper part of X.
NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly inside x.
TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
For NTPPi(x,z), all of z is inside x, and z does not touch x's boundary. Given that y is inside z, y is also inside x. y touches z's boundary, but z doesn't touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Wait, let me overthink the case of TPP(x,z). We have:
NTPPi(x,y), which means y is properly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPP(y,z), which means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z), x would be inside z and touch z's boundary. But then I'm not sure if the conditions with y are possible. y is inside x, which is inside z. y touches z's boundary, which means x must also touch z's boundary (which is consistent with TPP). But y doesn't touch x's boundary. 

Let me visualize: Imagine z is a large circle, x is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at one point, and y is an even smaller circle inside x that touches z's boundary at the same point where x touches z's boundary. But this doesn't work because then y would also touch x's boundary.

Actually, it doesn't make sense for y to touch z's boundary but not x's boundary if x is inside z. I think TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check this. Suppose TPP(x,z), i.e., x is a tangential proper part of z. Combining this with TPP(y,z), both x and y are tangential proper parts of z. And we're told that NTPPi(x,y), i.e., y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

If y is inside x without touching x's boundary, and x is inside z and touches z's boundary, then it's not possible for y to reach z's boundary, which TPP(y,z) requires. So TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

So, the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me try once more to check if I've missed anything or made a mistake.

Actually, I've been a bit sloppy in my reasoning, I think. Let's be more careful.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

NTPP(y,x) means:
1. y is a proper part of x.
2. y does not touch the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means:
1. y is a proper part of z.
2. y touches the boundary of z.

Let's consider each potential RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   If x and z are disconnected, then there can't be any region y that's part of both x and z. But we know y is part of both x and z. So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected (they touch at a boundary).
   If x and z only touch at a boundary, then there can't be a region y that's part of both x and z. But we know y is part of both. So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This means some part of x is inside z, some part of x is outside z, some part of z is inside x, and some part of z is outside x. We know y is inside both x and z, so there's at least some overlap. We need to check if it's possible for some part of x to be outside z, and some part of z to be outside x.
   
   y is properly inside x, so x extends beyond y. y touches the boundary of z, so if x has parts outside z, it's possible for y to both be properly inside x and touch the boundary of z. So it's possible for some part of x to be outside z.

   Similarly, y touches the boundary of z but doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means z's boundary is closer to y than x's boundary. This suggests that part of z could extend outside of x. So it's possible for some part of z to be outside x.

   So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z. We know y is inside x and therefore inside z. And y touches the boundary of z. But for x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would have to touch the boundary of z. Given that y is inside x and touches the boundary of z, that would mean y touches the boundary of x where x touches the boundary of z. But this contradicts the fact that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. So TPP(x,z) is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. We know y is inside x and therefore inside z. And y touches the boundary of z. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y, being inside x, can't touch the boundary of z either. This contradicts TPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means all of z is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x. We know y is inside z, which is consistent with y being inside x. y touches the boundary of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). z touches the boundary of x, which doesn't conflict with y not touching the boundary of x, as long as y doesn't extend all the way to where z touches x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This means all of z is inside x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. We know y is inside z, which is consistent with y being inside x. y touches the boundary of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). z doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is consistent with y not touching the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This means x and z are the same region. We know y is properly inside x, which means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But we also know y touches z's boundary. If x and z are the same, then y can't both not touch and touch the same boundary. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double check once more. We have:
- NTPPi(x,y), which means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z), which means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

1. PO(x,z): Some of x is inside z, some of x is outside z, some of z is inside x, and some of z is outside x. 
There is some overlap between x and z (at least y). y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. y is inside z and touches z's boundary. That z's boundary is "close" to y, inside x, but y still doesn't touch x's boundary. So there must be parts of z (including its boundary touching y) that extend fully inside x. And given that y is only a proper part of z, there could be parts of z outside of x. Also, x extends beyond y, but not necessarily beyond all of z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

2. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. y is inside z, so it's inside x, which is consistent. y touches z's boundary, which is consistent. z touches x's boundary, which doesn't contradict anything. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

3. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. y is inside z, so it's inside x, which is consistent. y touches z's boundary, which is consistent. z doesn't touch x's boundary, which is consistent. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I think this is the final answer.

Wait, let me see if I can also imagine these three possible scenarios to convince myself.

Scenario for PO(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle, and z is another circle that overlaps partially with x. y is a smaller circle that's entirely inside the overlap region of x and z, but doesn't touch the boundary of x, and does touch the boundary of z. Here, NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are both satisfied, and the relationship between x and z is PO.

Scenario for TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle, and z is a smaller circle entirely inside x that touches the boundary of x at one point. y is an even smaller circle entirely inside z, away from the point where z touches x, but touching the boundary of z somewhere. Here, NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are both satisfied, and the relationship between x and z is TPPi.

Scenario for NTPPi(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle, and z is a smaller circle entirely inside x, not touching the boundary of x. y is an even smaller circle entirely inside z, touching the boundary of z somewhere. Here, NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are both satisfied, and the relationship between x and z is NTPPi.

These scenarios confirm the three possible relationships:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me analyze each piece of information:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Now I'll analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - impossible because y is in both x and z, so they must overlap
2. EC(x,z) - impossible for the same reason
3. PO(x,z) - possible: x and z can partially overlap with y in the overlapping region
4. TPP(x,z) - impossible: if x were inside z touching z's boundary, then y couldn't simultaneously touch z's boundary while being non-tangential to x's boundary
5. NTPP(x,z) - impossible: if x were fully inside z not touching z's boundary, y couldn't touch z's boundary while being inside x
6. TPPi(x,z) - possible: z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, with y inside z
7. NTPPi(x,z) - possible: z can be fully inside x without touching x's boundary, with y inside z
8. EQ(x,z) - impossible: if x and z were identical, y couldn't simultaneously touch and not touch the same boundary

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
