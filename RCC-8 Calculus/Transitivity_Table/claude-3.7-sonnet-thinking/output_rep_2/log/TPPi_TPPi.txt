PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

We have TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's recall the definitions of these relations:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is a proper part of x and y touches x's boundary.

So TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning that y is a proper part of x and y touches x's boundary.
And TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning that z is a proper part of y and z touches y's boundary.

Let's figure out the relationship between x and z.

We know that:
- y is a proper part of x, and y touches x's boundary.
- z is a proper part of y, and z touches y's boundary.

Given that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, by transitivity we can infer that z is a proper part of x. So z is either a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)). 

But we need to determine whether z touches x's boundary. We know that z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary. But that doesn't necessarily mean that z touches x's boundary. It could be the case that z touches y's boundary at a part that is not touching x's boundary. In that case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

On the other hand, if z touches y's boundary at a point where y also touches x's boundary, then z would be touching x's boundary as well. In that case, z would be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by converting it to the standard RCC-8 relations. 

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(y,x), so we have TPP(y,x) and TPP(z,y).

Using TPP(y,x) and TPP(z,y):
- y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is a proper part of x and y touches x's boundary.
- z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is a proper part of y and z touches y's boundary.

Given that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, by transitivity we can infer that z is a proper part of x. 

Now, we need to determine whether z touches x's boundary. We know that z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary. But does z touch x's boundary?

It is indeed possible for z to touch x's boundary if z touches y's boundary at a point where y also touches x's boundary. In that case, z would be a tangential proper part of x, so TPP(z,x), or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).

But it's also possible for z to touch y's boundary at a point that is in the interior of x. In that case, z would not touch x's boundary, making z a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I missed a possibility. Let's think more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is a proper part of x and y touches x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is a proper part of y and z touches y's boundary.

Given that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, we know that z is a proper part of x.

For z to be a tangential proper part of x (i.e., TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z)), z needs to touch x's boundary. This can happen if z touches y's boundary at a point where y also touches x's boundary.

For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z)), z should not touch x's boundary. This can happen if z touches y's boundary only at points that are in the interior of x.

I'm not sure if there are other possibilities, so let me think a bit more.

Actually, I think that is all. The relation between x and z cannot be DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP or EQ given the constraints. So we are left with TPPi and NTPPi.

Actually, I should check whether there are composition tables already devised in the RCC-8 literature. Let me use those instead of reasoning from first principles, to make sure I'm correct.

According to the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of TPPi with TPPi gives us {TPPi, NTPPi}. That confirms my reasoning that the possible relations between x and z are either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's make sure I've used the correct form. I'll rephrase in the form of the composition operation we're computing, which is TPPi o TPPi (where 'o' denotes composition).

Computing TPPi o TPPi:
- TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y.
- From these, we want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Given that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, z must be a proper part of x. So, z is either a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)).

Deciding between these two possibilities requires us to determine whether z touches x's boundary:
- For TPPi(x,z): z must touch x's boundary. This can happen if z touches y's boundary at a point where y also touches x's boundary.
- For NTPPi(x,z): z must not touch x's boundary. This can happen if z touches y's boundary only at points that are in the interior of x.

Since both scenarios are possible based on the given conditions, the possible relations between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, to make sure I'm not confused now, let me double-check that my definition of TPPi is correct. 

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning that y is completely within x, but touches x's boundary.
So TPP is the inverse relation: TPP(y,x) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning that y is completely within x, but touches x's boundary.

So here's the situation:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and y touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and z touches y's boundary.

From this, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

We know that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z is a proper part of x. So it's either TPP(z,x) (which is the same as TPPi(x,z)) or NTPP(z,x) (which is the same as NTPPi(x,z)).

Now, we need to determine whether z touches x's boundary. We know that z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary. If z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary. In that case, the relationship between x and z would be TPPi(x,z) (or TPP(z,x)).

However, if z touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch x's boundary (i.e., at points that are in the interior of x), then z would not touch x's boundary. In that case, the relationship between x and z would be NTPPi(x,z) (or NTPP(z,x)).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

However, there's another scenario to consider. What if z is equal to x? Let's check if this is possible given the constraints:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y.

If z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, then z is a proper part of x. This means z cannot be equal to x.

So, indeed, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I think I'm forgetting to properly think about the constraints!

Let's carefully lay out what TPPi(x,y) means again:
- y is a proper part of x (i.e., y is fully contained within x, but is not equal to x).
- y touches x's boundary.

And TPPi(y,z) means:
- z is a proper part of y (i.e., z is fully contained within y, but is not equal to y).
- z touches y's boundary.

From these, we can deduce:
- Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, z is a proper part of x (by transitivity of the "proper part" relationship). This means z is fully contained within x and is not equal to x.
- Given that z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, there are two scenarios:
  1. z touches x's boundary. This would mean TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).
  2. z doesn't touch x's boundary. This would mean NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is still the same: the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check this by visualizing a couple of examples to make sure both of those configurations are possible:

Example 1: TPPi(x,z)
Imagine x as a large square, y as a slightly smaller square inside x, such that y touches the boundary of x (at one edge). And consider z as an even smaller square inside y, such that z touches the boundary of y at the same edge where y touches the boundary of x. In this configuration, z is a proper part of x (because z is fully contained within x and is not equal to x), and z touches the boundary of x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z).

Example 2: NTPPi(x,z)
Imagine x as a large square, y as a slightly smaller square inside x, such that y touches the boundary of x (at one edge). And now, consider z as an even smaller square inside y, but in a way that z touches the boundary of y at an edge that is completely within the interior of x. In this configuration, z is a proper part of x (because z is fully contained within x and is not equal to x), but z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me make sure I haven't flipped the relations. TPPi(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part inverse of y, which means that y is a tangential proper part of x.

So we have:
- TPPi(x,y): So y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z): So z is a tangential proper part of y.

Given that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, we know that z is a proper part of x.

If the boundary of z touches the boundary of x, then z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPP(z,x). But TPP(z,x) is equivalent to TPPi(x,z). So one possibility is TPPi(x,z).

If the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x). But NTPP(z,x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z). So the other possibility is NTPPi(x,z).

Both of these scenarios are possible, so the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

I apologize if I was previously unclear, but the answer remains consistent: the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, there may be a more straightforward way to verify this. Since TPPi is just the inverse of TPP, we can use the composition table for RCC-8 to find the result of composing TPPi with TPPi:

TPPi o TPPi = (TPP^-1) o (TPP^-1) = (TPP o TPP)^-1

Where (^-1) denotes the inverse operation.

According to the RCC-8 composition table, the result of composing TPP with TPP is {TPP, NTPP}. Taking the inverse of this, we get {TPPi, NTPPi}.

So, the result of composing TPPi with TPPi is {TPPi, NTPPi}, which confirms our previous reasoning: the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's make sure. To compute the inverse composition (TPP o TPP)^-1, I have to use the following rule: (R o S)^-1 = S^-1 o R^-1, where R and S are binary relations.

So, (TPP o TPP)^-1 = TPP^-1 o TPP^-1 = TPPi o TPPi, which is what we were computing in the first place.

Let's look up the RCC-8 composition table for TPP o TPP. According to the table, the result of composing TPP with TPP is {TPP, NTPP}.

Therefore, the result of composing TPPi with TPPi is {TPPi, NTPPi}.

This confirms our reasoning: the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

But actually the way I set up the problem, we don't need to use the composition table. I just need to think about the transitivity of the part-of relation.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): So y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z): So z is a tangential proper part of y.

Given that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, we know that z is a proper part of x. The question is whether z is a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x.

To be a tangential proper part, z must touch the boundary of x. We know that y touches the boundary of x (since y is a tangential proper part of x). If z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

To be a non-tangential proper part, z must not touch the boundary of x. If z touches y at a point that is in the interior of x (not on the boundary of x), then z doesn't touch the boundary of x. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Both of these scenarios are possible given the information. So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

In summary, given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what follows from the given relations:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

From these facts, I can determine:
1. Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, then z must be a proper part of x (by transitivity).
2. The question is whether z touches x's boundary or not.

Two scenarios are possible:

Scenario 1: If z touches y's boundary at a point where y also touches x's boundary, then z will touch x's boundary as well. This gives us TPPi(x,z).

Scenario 2: If z only touches y's boundary at points that are in the interior of x (not touching x's boundary), then z will not touch x's boundary. This gives us NTPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are consistent with the given information.
