PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the constraints. We're told:
- TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained in x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z), which means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

We need to determine all possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Let's consider the possibilities systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected
   Since y is part of x, and y touches z, it means that x and z must share at least a boundary point (because y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary). So x and z cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected
   This is possible. We could have a situation where z touches x exactly at the points where y touches x's boundary. So x and z share boundary points but no interior.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
   This is possible. Z could overlap with a part of x that is not y. Z and y are just touching, and y is inside x, so z could partially overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   This doesn't seem possible. Since y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is externally connected to z, it would mean that x extends beyond z (because y touches x's boundary), contradicting x being a part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is definitely not possible. If x is contained entirely within z, then y (which is part of x) would be contained entirely within z, contradicting EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   This is possible. Z could be inside x and touch the boundary of x, just like y is inside x and touches the boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is not possible. If z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary, then z and y (which touches the boundary of x) would be disjoint, contradicting EC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   This is not possible. If x and z are identical, then y would be a tangential proper part of z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

Let me double-check by thinking of concrete examples or counterexamples for each relation.

For EC(x,z), imagine a configuration where y is a proper part of x, touching the boundary of x, and z is outside x, touching x only at the points where y touches the boundary of x.

For PO(x,z), imagine a configuration where y is a small region inside x, touching the boundary of x, and z overlaps with a part of x, but also extends outside x, and touches y at the boundary of y.

For TPPi(x,z), imagine a configuration where z is inside x, touching the boundary of x, and y is also inside x, touching the boundary of x, and y and z touch each other at their boundaries.

Actually, let's be more careful about TPPi(x,z). Since y is a tangential proper part of x, and EC(y,z), it's not clear if z can be a proper part of x. Let me think about this again. If y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and z is also inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y and z touch each other, is this configuration possible?

Actually I think TPPi(x,z) is not possible, because TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) implies that z has to extend outside of x. By TPPi(x,y), we mean that y is a proper part of x. By EC(y,z) we mean that y and z touch but don't share interior points. Z has to be outside of x at least in part, and it touches y at the boundary. But if z were a proper part of x, then z would be inside x. But z needs to touch y at the boundary, and y is already a proper part of x touching the boundary of x. So I don't think z can be a proper part of x.

Let me try to construct a concrete example to see if TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Actually I think I was confused. TPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x. Let me imagine a situation. Imagine x is a disc, and y is a smaller disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. Now, z could be another small disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a different point q, and also touching y at a point r. In this case, we'd have TPPi(x,y), TPPi(x,z), and EC(y,z). So I think TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me re-evaluate all the options:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected
   Not possible, as explained above.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected
   This is possible. Imagine a situation where z is outside x and touches x at the same point where y touches the boundary of x.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
   This is possible. Z could overlap partially with x, sharing some interior points, and also extend outside of x. Where y and z touch would be on the boundary of y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   Upon further reflection, I think this is possible. Imagine x is a region, and y is a smaller region inside x, touching the boundary of x. Now, z could be a larger region containing x, where x touches the boundary of z exactly at the points where y touches the boundary of x.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is not possible. If x is strictly inside z without touching the boundary, then y (which is inside x) would be strictly inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   This is possible, as explained above.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is not possible. If z is strictly inside x without touching the boundary, then z and y (which touches the boundary of x) would not be externally connected, contradicting EC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   This is not possible. If x and z are identical, then y would be a tangential proper part of z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

Let me think again about TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is inside z and touches the boundary of z, and y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, would EC(y,z) be possible? 

I think we need to consider two cases:
1. If y touches the boundary of x at a point that's also on the boundary of z, then y would touch the boundary of z. But this doesn't mean y and z are externally connected; to be EC(y,z), y should be outside z except at the boundary.
2. If y touches the boundary of x at a point that's inside z, then y would be strictly inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, I now believe TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me re-evaluate all the options one more time:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected
   Not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected
   Possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
   Possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   Actually, I'm thinking this might be possible in certain configuations. If y touches the boundary of x at a point that's also on the boundary of z, and z extends beyond x at other points, then we could have TPP(x,z) and EC(y,z).

   Let me try to construct an example. Imagine x is a disc, and y is a smaller disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. Now, z could be a larger disc containing x, where x touches the boundary of z only at the point p. The rest of z extends beyond x. In this case, y would be externally connected to z at the point p, and x would be a tangential proper part of z.

   Yes, I think TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   Not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   Let me reconsider this. We have TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z). If z is also a tangential proper part of x, then both y and z are inside x, touching the boundary of x. And we also need EC(y,z). Is this possible?

   I think yes. Imagine x is a disc, y is a smaller disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. Now, z could be another small disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a different point q, and also touching y at a point r. In this case, we'd have TPPi(x,y), TPPi(x,z), and EC(y,z).

   So TPPi(x,z) seems possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Not possible, as explained above.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   Not possible, as explained above.

Let me double-check all these possibilities by considering concrete examples and checking consistency.

For EC(x,z):
Imagine a situation where z is outside x and touches x at the same point where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, y is inside x, touching the boundary of x, and z is outside x, touching y at the boundary. This seems consistent with TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

For PO(x,z):
Imagine a situation where z overlaps with a part of x, but also extends outside x, and touches y at the boundary of y. This seems consistent with TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine x is a disc, and y is a smaller disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. Now, z could be a larger disc containing x, where x touches the boundary of z only at the point p. The rest of z extends beyond x. In this case, y would be externally connected to z at the point p, and x would be a tangential proper part of z. This configuration seems consistent with TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x is a disc, y is a smaller disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. Now, z could be another small disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a different point q, and also touching y at a point r. This configuration seems consistent with TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Hmm, actually I see a problem with my TPPi(x,z) example. If y and z are both inside x, touching the boundary of x at different points, how can they be externally connected, EC(y,z)? They would need to touch each other, which might be hard to arrange geometrically.

Let me think of a different example. Imagine x is a U-shaped region, with y and z being two small discs inside the two branches of the U. Both y and z touch the boundary of x, but they're separated from each other by the "opening" of the U. However, this configuration doesn't satisfy EC(y,z); y and z would be disconnected in this case.

Let's try again. Imagine x is a disc with a hole in the middle, y is a smaller disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. Now, z could be a disc inside the hole, touching the inner boundary of x and also touching y at a point. However, this would make y and z part of the same connected component, which contradicts EC(y,z).

I'm finding it hard to construct an example where TPPi(x,z) holds along with TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z). I'll reconsider this case.

Actually I think TPPi(x,z) is not possible. If y and z are both tangential proper parts of x, and we also need EC(y,z), y and z must touch at their boundaries. But for y to be externally connected to z, they must not share any interior points. Given that both y and z are inside x, it's hard to see how they could touch at their boundaries without sharing interior points or being disconnected. The spatial arrangement seems to prevent TPPi(x,z) from holding concurrently with TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's do a final re-evaluation:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected
   Not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected
   Possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
   Possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   Possible. Here's an example: Imagine x is a disc, y is a small disc inside x, touching x at a point p on its boundary. z is a larger disc that contains x, and x touches the boundary of z precisely at the point p.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   Not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   After reconsideration, I now believe this is not possible. If z is a tangential proper part of x, it would be inside x, touching the boundary of x. And for EC(y,z) to hold, y and z must touch at their boundaries. Given that y is also a tangential proper part of x, it seems impossible to arrange y and z in a way that they're both inside x, both touch the boundary of x, and also touch each other at their boundaries without overlapping.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   Not possible.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- EC(x,z) - externally connected
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z

Actually, let me re-examine TPPi(x,z) once more. Could there be a configuration where both y and z are inside x, both touch the boundary of x, and also touch each other at their boundaries?

Let's think of x as a large disc. y can be a smaller disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. z can be another disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point q. Now, the question is: can we arrange y and z such that they also touch each other at their boundaries?

Actually, yes, I think we can. Imagine placing y and z in a way that they're internally tangent to each other, while both also being internally tangent to the larger disc x. This would make both y and z tangential proper parts of x, and also make them externally connected to each other.

So, upon further reflection, I believe TPPi(x,z) is possible after all.

Therefore, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- EC(x,z) - externally connected
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x

But wait let me double-check TPP(x,z) again because I'm a bit confused. We assumed TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a proper part of x. and EC(y,z), which means that y and z touch at their boundaries. If x is a proper part of z, then every part of x is also a part of z, which means y is a part of z. But then y and z would not be externally connected. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait a moment. Let me be more careful. TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x. There's a part of x that's not part of y. TPP(x,z) means x is inside z (touching z's boundary). EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is inside x and touches x's boundary, there are two cases:
1. If y touches the boundary of x at a point that's also on the boundary of z, then y would touch the boundary of z. In this case, y is inside z (because it's inside x, which is inside z) and touches the boundary of z. This doesn't satisfy EC(y,z); in fact, it would be TPP(y,z).
2. If y touches the boundary of x at a point that's inside z, then y would be strictly inside z without touching the boundary of z. This doesn't satisfy EC(y,z) either; it would be NTPP(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) doesn't seem to be a valid possibility. Let's revise our answer.

I've been having trouble figuring out TPP(x,z). Let me create a very clear example. 

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x, touching the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Let's say we have a square as x, and a smaller square inside it as y, where y touches the boundary of x. Now, for z:

If TPP(x,z), then x is inside z, touching the boundary of z. So, our square x is inside a larger square z, and they touch at the boundary. But then, since y is inside x, y is also inside z. Since y touches the boundary of x, and x touches the boundary of z, if they touch at the same point, then y would also touch the boundary of z.

OK so the case of TPP(x,z) hinges on the question: if TPPi(x,y) and TPP(x,z), and y touches the boundary of x, and x touches the boundary of z, does it necessarily mean that y touches the boundary of z? I think the answer is "not necessarily".

Imagine x is a disc, and y is a smaller disc inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. Now, z could be a larger disc containing x, where x touches the boundary of z at a different point q. In this case, y would be completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

BUT if TPP(x,z) and x touches the boundary of z at the same point where y touches the boundary of x, then y would also touch the boundary of z. In this case, y would be inside z and touch the boundary of z, which is TPP(y,z), not EC(y,z).

OK, so TPP(x,z) is not possible. Let me revise my answer.

The possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- EC(x,z) - externally connected
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x

Let's quickly make sure that TPPi(x,z) is indeed feasible:
- TPPi(x,z) means z is inside x, touching the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.
- TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x, touching the boundary of x.

Is it possible to have both y and z inside x, both touching the boundary of x, and also touching each other at their boundaries without overlapping?

I think it is. Both y and z could be inside x, like two circles inside a larger circle. Both circles could touch the boundary of the larger circle, and they could also touch each other. This would make y and z externally connected, and both would be tangential proper parts of x. So TPPi(x,z) seems feasible.

OK, so the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- EC(x,z) - externally connected
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I'm rethinking PO(x,z) as well. If z partially overlaps with x, then z has parts inside x and parts outside x. For y to be externally connected to z, they would need to touch at their boundaries. y is inside x, touching the boundary of x. If the parts of z that are inside x do not overlap with y, then y and z would be disconnected (DC). If the parts of z that are inside x do overlap with y, then y and z would partially overlap (PO), not externally connected (EC). It's also possible for y to touch the parts of z that cross the boundary of x, which would make y and z externally connected.

Actually, I think PO(x,z) is possible. Imagine x is a square, y is a smaller square inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. Now, z could be another square that overlaps partially with x, crossing the boundary of x at point p. In this case, y would be externally connected to z at the point p, and x and z would partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

But, let me be more general. We have TPPi(x,y), which means y is inside x, touching the boundary of x. We have EC(y,z), which means y and z touch at their boundaries.

for z to not be a part of x, there has to be a part of z outside x. for y and z to touch at their boundaries, they must touch at a point. Since y is inside x, touching the boundary of x, the point where y and z touch has to be on the boundary of x. This means z must extend outside of x, crossing the boundary of x at the point where y touches the boundary of x. There are two cases:
1. If z is partially inside x and partially outside x, then x and z partially overlap (PO).
2. If z is entirely outside x except at the point where y touches the boundary of x, then x and z are externally connected (EC).
3. if z is inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point, and also touching y at a point, then z is a tangential proper part of x (TPPi).

Alright, so the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check each:

For EC(x,z): Consider x as a square, y as a smaller square inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. z can be a square outside x, touching x only at the point p. In this case, y and z also touch at the point p, so EC(y,z) holds, and z and x are externally connected, so EC(x,z) holds. ✓

For PO(x,z): Consider x as a square, y as a smaller square inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. z can be a square that partially overlaps with x, crossing the boundary of x at the point p. In this case, y and z touch at the point p, so EC(y,z) holds, and z and x partially overlap, so PO(x,z) holds. ✓

For TPPi(x,z): Consider x as a square, y as a smaller square inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. z can be another smaller square inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point q, and also touching y at a point r. In this case, y and z touch at the point r, so EC(y,z) holds, and z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z) holds. ✓

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

OK but let me do one further check on the feasibility of TPPi(x,z). If y and z are both tangential proper parts of x, and they touch at their boundaries, do they necessarily overlap?

Let's imagine a square x. Inside x, we have two smaller squares, y and z, both touching the boundary of x. Can y and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping?

OK so here's an example. Imagine a square x, and inside it, two smaller rectangles y and z. y is in the left side of x, and z is in the right side of x. Both rectangles touch the top boundary of x, and in particular, touch each other at their upper right (for y) and upper left (for z) corners. In this case, y and z are disjoint except at this corner point. So TPPi(x,y), TPPi(x,z), and EC(y,z) all hold.

Let me just do one more check of all our relations:

EC(x,z): ✓
PO(x,z): ✓
TPPi(x,z): ✓

So, the final answer is: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just check one more time for all possible relations.

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected
   Not possible. For y to be externally connected to z, y and z must touch at their boundaries. Since y is a tangential proper part of x, if y touches z, then x must also touch z. So x and z cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected
   Possible. As shown above.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
   Possible. As shown above.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
   Not possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then every part of x is also a part of z. Since y is a tangential proper part of x, y is also a part of z. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which states that y and z touch only at their boundaries.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   Not possible. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then every part of x is also a part of z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. Since y is a tangential proper part of x, y is also a part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which states that y and z touch at their boundaries.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
   Possible. As shown above.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Not possible. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x. For EC(y,z) to hold, y and z must touch at their boundaries. Since y is a tangential proper part of x, y touches the boundary of x. If z does not touch the boundary of x, then it's hard to see how y and z could touch at their boundaries without z also touching the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
   Not possible. If x and z are identical, then since y is a tangential proper part of x, y is also a tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which states that y and z touch only at their boundaries.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

OK actually I think I'm wrong about NTPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is strictly inside x without touching the boundary of x. For EC(y,z) to hold, y and z must touch at their boundaries, but not overlap.

I previously though that if y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is inside x, then y and z might not be able to touch. But that's wrong. y could be a tangential proper part of x, touching the boundary of x at a point, and z could be inside x (not touching the boundary of x), but still touching y at a point. In this case, y and z would be externally connected, and z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me picture this:
x is a square. y is a smaller square inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. z is another square, strictly inside x, not touching the boundary of x, but touching y at a point q. In this case, TPPi(x,y), NTPPi(x,z), and EC(y,z) all hold.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait let me really check each relation carefully:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are disconnected, then since y is a part of x, y and z would also be disconnected. This contradicts EC(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can be externally connected if they touch at the same point where y and z touch.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with z crossing the boundary of x at the point where y and z touch.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then y, being a part of x, would also be a part of z. This contradicts EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as above.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x, touching the boundary of x, and also touching y at a different point.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be strictly inside x, not touching the boundary of x, but still touching y at a point. This is the conclusion I came to in my previous analysis.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are identical, then y, being a part of x, would also be a part of z. This contradicts EC(y,z).

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double check the case of NTPPi(x,z).
For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z needs to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z has to be strictly inside x, not touching the boundary of x. For EC(y,z) to be true, y and z need to be disjoint, with only boundary touching. If y is a tangential proper part of x, then y touches the boundary of x.

To visualize this, I need y to be touching the boundary of x (tangential), z to be not touching the boundary of x (non-tangential), and y and z to be touching at the boundary but not overlapping (externally connected).

I think this still works. Imagine a circle x, a smaller circle y inside x, touching the boundary of x at a point p. Then, another small circle z entirely inside x, not touching the boundary of x, but touching y at the boundary.  In this case, y and z would be externally connected, and z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Now let me sanity-check my concrete example of TPPi(x,z). For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z needs to be a tangential proper part of x. This means z has to be inside x, touching the boundary of x. For EC(y,z) to be true, y and z need to be disjoint, with only boundary touching.

So, z is inside x, touching the boundary of x. y is also inside x, touching the boundary of x. And, y and z need to touch at the boundary, without overlapping. This is like two circles inside a larger circle, both touching the larger circle, and also touching each other.

This works as well. So, I maintain that the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

So, the final answer is:
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step-by-step.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z), which means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Let's check each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible. If y touches z and y is part of x, then x must have some connection to z.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible. This occurs when z touches x exactly at the same boundary point where y touches the boundary of x.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. Z can partially overlap with x, crossing x's boundary at the point where y and z touch.

4. TPP(x,z) - Not possible. If x were a proper part of z, then y would be a proper part of z too (since y is part of x), contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible. Similar reasoning to TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. Z can be inside x, touching x's boundary at some point, while also touching y at a different point.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible. Z can be completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), while still touching y at y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be a proper part of z, contradicting EC(y,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
