PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem systematically.

We know that:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

We want to determine the possible RCC-8 relation(s) between x and z.

Given these relations, let's consider what we know about the spatial relationships:
- x is completely contained within y (NTPP)
- y is completely contained within z (TPP)

From these two facts, we can determine that x must be completely contained within z as well. The question is whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

Let's think about this in terms of boundaries:
- x does not touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(x,y))
- y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z))

Since x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and y might only touch z's boundary at some points but not necessarily all around, x cannot reach z's boundary. This means x must be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. Could it be possible that x touches the boundary of z even though it doesn't touch the boundary of y?

If x doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y is contained within z, then x must be contained within z as well. The only way x could touch the boundary of z is if y touches the boundary of z at exactly the same location where x is positioned within y. But since x doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(x,y)), and y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)), x must be strictly inside z without touching its boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me reconsider this carefully. 

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Does this mean x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary? Let's visualize this:

Imagine y as a circle that touches the boundary of z. Now, x is a smaller circle completely inside y, not touching y's boundary. 

Can x touch the boundary of z? Given that y touches the boundary of z, and x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), x cannot reach the boundary of z through y's touch point. So, x must be strictly inside z without touching its boundary, which is NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check again to make sure I'm not overlooking any possibilities. 

NTPP(x,y): x is strictly inside y.
TPP(y,z): y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's think about this from a different angle. If y touches the boundary of z at some point, and x is strictly inside y, then x is separated from the boundary of z by at least the distance from x to the boundary of y. So, x cannot touch the boundary of z. This means x is strictly inside z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

I'm convinced that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, actually wait. I think I was too hasty in my reasoning. Let's think about this more carefully.

If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches the boundary of z. Since y touches the boundary of z, it means that part of y's boundary coincides with part of z's boundary.

Now, if NTPP(x,y), then x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. This means that x is separated from the boundary of y by some distance.

Given these two facts, could x possibly touch the boundary of z?

If part of y's boundary coincides with part of z's boundary, and x doesn't touch y's boundary, then x also doesn't touch z's boundary (at least not at the coinciding parts).

Could x touch z's boundary at some other point? No, because x is completely contained within y, and y is contained within z. So, x must be strictly inside z as well.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I think I've been overthinking this. The answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, to be absolutely certain, let's check if there's a formal composition table for RCC-8 relations that we can refer to.

The composition table for RCC-8 gives the possible relations that can hold between two regions x and z, given the relations between x and y, and between y and z.

From the composition table for RCC-8, when NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relation(s) between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check by constructing a formal argument. Let me use the traditional logic of RCC-8.

Let's think about this step by step.

1. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means every point in x is also in y, and x doesn't touch y's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means every point in y is also in z, and y touches z's boundary.

Given the transitivity of "part of" relation, if x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z.

Now, can x touch the boundary of z? Let's consider the possibilities:
- If x were to touch the boundary of z, it would mean that there's a point in x that is on the boundary of z.
- But for this to happen, given that x is fully inside y, y would have to touch the boundary of z at exactly the same location where x is positioned within y.
- However, since x doesn't touch the boundary of y (from NTPP(x,y)), it's not possible for x to touch the boundary of z through the touch point of y and z.

Actually, let me reconsider the spatial relationships more carefully.

In the RCC-8 calculus, the relation between x and z is determined by the composition of the relations NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z). The composition NTPP o TPP gives the possible relation(s) between x and z.

From the composition table for RCC-8, NTPP o TPP = NTPP. This means that when NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let's be sure that NTPP o TPP = NTPP is correct. Let's reason through this.

From NTPP(x,y), x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
From TPP(y,z), y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

Let's visualize: Imagine z as the outer region, y inside z but touching its boundary, and x inside y without touching y's boundary.

Given that x is strictly inside y and y is inside z, x must also be inside z. Now, can x touch the boundary of z?

For x to touch the boundary of z, it would have to extend to at least one point on z's boundary. But since x doesn't touch y's boundary and y touches z's boundary, there's a separation between x and z's boundary. Therefore, x cannot touch the boundary of z.

This reasoning confirms that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation.

Actually, I think I should just look things up. If I recall correctly, there is indeed a composition table for the RCC-8 calculus, and the composition of NTPP and TPP is NTPP.

Let me think about it in another way to double-check. 

If NTPP(x,y), then x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches the boundary of z.

Since x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, there's a certain distance between x and the boundary of y. Now, y touches the boundary of z at some point, but x, being strictly inside y, is separated from this touch point by at least the distance to y's boundary. Therefore, x cannot touch the boundary of z, making the relation between x and z NTPP(x,z).

I believe NTPP(x,z) is the correct answer. Let me just double-check with one more visualization:

- z is the outermost region.
- y is inside z and touches z's boundary at at least one point.
- x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary at any point.

From this visualization, it's clear that x is strictly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let's be doubly sure. Let me revisit the RCC-8 calculus and the composition of NTPP and TPP.

In the RCC-8 calculus, the composition table lists the possible relations that can hold between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

From the composition table, NTPP o TPP = NTPP. This confirms that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation.

Summarizing, based on logical reasoning and the formal composition rules of the RCC-8 calculus, the relationship between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

I think there might be confusion when computing the composition directly, since spatial reasoning is complex. So I'll try to be yet more careful in this analysis. Let me proceed by focusing on the definitions of the RCC-8 relations and derive the result step by step.

First, let's revisit the definitions of the RCC-8 relations:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that every point in x is also in y, and x is not connected to the boundary of y.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means that every point in y is also in z, and y is connected to the boundary of z.

Now, given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), let's derive the relation between x and z:

1. From NTPP(x,y), we know that every point in x is also in y, and x is not connected to the boundary of y.
2. From TPP(y,z), we know that every point in y is also in z, and y is connected to the boundary of z.

Combining these, we can say:
- Every point in x is also in y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- Every point in y is also in z (from TPP(y,z)).
- Therefore, every point in x is also in z (transitivity of the "part of" relation).

This means that x is definitely a proper part of z. The question is whether x is a tangential (TPP) or non-tangential (NTPP) proper part of z.

For x to be a tangential proper part of z, it would need to be connected to the boundary of z.

Can x be connected to the boundary of z?
From NTPP(x,y), x is not connected to the boundary of y.
From TPP(y,z), y is connected to the boundary of z.

Since x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), and y touches the boundary of z, x is separated from the boundary of z by at least the distance to y's boundary. Therefore, x cannot be connected to the boundary of z.

This means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

I am confident that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relation.

Actually, I just realized I need to be careful here in my reasoning. I've been implicitly assuming a standard Euclidean geometry with standard notions of boundaries and interiors. But RCC-8 is more general and applies to arbitrary topological spaces where "boundary" and "interior" are well-defined.

Let's get back to the basic definitions of RCC-8. In RCC-8, "connection" is the primitive relation, and other relations are defined in terms of it. Two regions are connected if they share a point.

With this in mind, let's reconsider the question.

NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is a proper part of y, and x is not connected to the complement of y.
TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means that y is a proper part of z, and y is connected to the complement of z.

From these, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

If x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z. The question is whether x is tangential or non-tangential to z.

For x to be tangential to z, it would need to be connected to the complement of z. But x is not connected to the complement of y (from NTPP(x,y)), and the complement of z is a subset of the complement of y (since y is a proper part of z). Therefore, x cannot be connected to the complement of z, which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

Actually, in the RCC-8 literature, I'm pretty sure the composition table for NTPP and TPP is correct: NTPP o TPP = NTPP, which means that given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z). But I want to double-check this with a topological argument.

In topological terms, NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper subset of the interior of y. 
TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper subset of z, and y intersects the boundary of z.

From NTPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper subset of the interior of y. This means that every point in x is also in the interior of y.

From TPP(y,z), we know that y is a proper subset of z. This means that every point in y is also in z. Additionally, some points of y are on the boundary of z.

Combining these, we can say that every point in x is also in the interior of y. Since y is a proper subset of z, every point in the interior of y is also in the interior of z. Therefore, every point in x is in the interior of z.

This means that x is a proper subset of the interior of z, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, hold on a second. I'm not sure if it's true that "every point in the interior of y is also in the interior of z" when TPP(y,z). Let me revisit this.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper subset of z, and y intersects the boundary of z. This doesn't guarantee that every point in the interior of y is also in the interior of z. In fact, it's possible for some points in the interior of y to be on the boundary of z.

Let's reconsider the question with a more direct approach.

In the RCC-8 calculus, the relation between x and z is determined by the composition of the relations NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Checking the RCC-8 composition table, NTPP o TPP = NTPP. This means that given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

OK, there's probably confusion on my part because I'm trying to introduce spatial intuition here, but the standard intuition might not directly apply to the general topological spaces.

Let's revisit using purely the logic of RCC-8. Two key points:
1. In RCC-8, region "parts" are true subsets, and the relation part_of is transitive.
2. NTPP means that a region is a proper part and not connected to the complement of its container.

Given that:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

We know:
- x is a proper part of y (from NTPP(x,y)).
- y is a proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)).

By transitivity:
- x is a proper part of z.

For the relation between x and z to be TPP(x,z), x would need to be connected to the complement of z. But x is not connected to the complement of y (from NTPP(x,y)), and the complement of z is a subset of the complement of y (since y is a proper part of z). This means x is not connected to the complement of z, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

I believe NTPP(x,z) is the correct answer.

In sum, the possible relationship between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship x has with z, given that NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's analyze what we know:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Since x is completely inside y (and doesn't touch y's boundary), and y is completely inside z, it follows that x must be completely inside z as well.

Can x touch the boundary of z? For this to happen, x would need to reach the boundary of z through y. However, since x doesn't touch y's boundary at all (from NTPP(x,y)), and the only way y connects to z's boundary is at their touch points (from TPP(y,z)), x cannot possibly reach z's boundary.

Therefore, x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
