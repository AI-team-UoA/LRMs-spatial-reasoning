PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this. We're given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that EQ(x,y), x and y are spatially identical. This means x has the same spatial relationship with z as y does with z.

Since y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), and x is coincident with y, it follows that x must also be disconnected from z.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning:

EQ(x,y) means x and y are spatially identical.
DC(y,z) means y and z share no spatial parts.
So x, being identical to y, cannot share any spatial parts with z either.
Thus, DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Yes, I'm confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relationships EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) constrain the possible relationship between x and z.

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space and have identical boundaries.

DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected - they share no parts and don't even touch at their boundaries.

Since x and y are spatially identical (EQ), and y is disconnected from z (DC), it follows that x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
