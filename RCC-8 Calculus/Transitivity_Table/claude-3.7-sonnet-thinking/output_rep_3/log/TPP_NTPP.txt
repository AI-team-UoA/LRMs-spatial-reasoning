PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that x is part of y, and y is part of z, we know that x is also part of z (transitivity of the "part of" relation). 

Now, we need to determine whether x touches the boundary of z.

Since y does not touch the boundary of z (NTPP(y,z)), and x is inside y, there are two possibilities:
1. x could be strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary. In this case, x would be strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z).
2. x could touch y's boundary (which is the case here, since TPP(x,y)). However, y's boundary is completely inside z (since NTPP(y,z)). Therefore, x touching y's boundary doesn't imply that x touches z's boundary. In fact, x would still be strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary. This means NTPP(x,z).

I realize both cases lead to the same result: NTPP(x,z). Let me double-check my reasoning...

Actually, I think I made a mistake. Let me reconsider.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Since y is part of z, and x is part of y, it follows that x is part of z.

Now, does x touch the boundary of z?
- y does not touch the boundary of z.
- x touches the boundary of y.

Given that y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, x is still within the interior of z and does not touch z's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(x,z).

I'm going to double-check once more to make sure I'm not missing anything.

I have TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

From TPP(x,y), I have:
- x is a proper part of y.
- x touches the boundary of y.

From NTPP(y,z), I have:
- y is a proper part of z.
- y does not touch the boundary of z.

Given that y is strictly inside z, and x is inside y, it's clear that x is also strictly inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means NTPP(x,z).

I'm confident in this conclusion. The answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me think about this more carefully. I want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything.

When we say TPP(x,y), it means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. x is a proper part of y.
2. x touches the boundary of y.

When we say NTPP(y,z), it means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means:
1. y is a proper part of z.
2. y does not touch the boundary of z.

Now, considering the relationship between x and z:
1. Since x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, it follows that x is a proper part of z (transitivity).
2. Does x touch the boundary of z? 
   - x touches the boundary of y.
   - y is completely inside z, not touching its boundary.
   
   Given these, x, being inside y and possibly touching y's boundary, will still be completely inside z and will not touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to be more precise. Suppose we have a 2D space. 

x is a tangential proper part of y, so x is inside y and touches the boundary of y. For example, imagine a small circle x inside a larger circle y, such that the boundary of x touches the boundary of y at a single point.

y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is completely inside z without touching the boundary of z. Imagine the circle y inside a larger circle z, with some space between the boundaries of y and z.

Now, if we consider x in relation to z, x is inside y, which is inside z. Since the boundary of y is completely inside z, and x touches the boundary of y but doesn't go beyond it, x is completely inside z without touching the boundary of z.

This means NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to double-check that this is the only possible relationship, since the question is asking for all possible relationships. Let me think about this more carefully.

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we have:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

The only way for x to touch the boundary of z would be if x somehow extended beyond the boundary of y, which contradicts the definition of TPP(x,y). Since x is inside y and y is strictly inside z, x must be strictly inside z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, there's also a theoretical possibility:

Imagine a case where z is an annular ring (a donut shape), y is a smaller ring inside z but not touching z, and x is a small disc inside y such that it touches the inner boundary of y. In this case, x is strictly inside z but doesn't touch the outer boundary of z. 

Actually, wait, this doesn't change the conclusion. In this case, x is still strictly inside z without touching the outer boundary of z. The relationship is still NTPP(x,z).

I am confident that the only possible relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, hang on. Let me revisit a point I made above: the definition of TPP(x,y) does not imply x can go beyond the boundary of y. If it did, it would not be a "proper part." TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Since y is strictly inside z, and x is inside y, x is strictly inside z.

The relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let's double-check by reasoning again:

TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary. However, x is still entirely contained within y.
NTPP(y,z): y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary. This means y is entirely within the interior of z.

Given these conditions, x is inside y, which is inside the interior of z. There's a "buffer" between the boundary of y and the boundary of z. Since x can only touch the boundary of y (not extend beyond it), x is also within the interior of z and cannot touch the boundary of z. This confirms that the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

To be thorough, let me quickly review the other RCC-8 relations and confirm they are not possible:

DC(x,z) - disconnected: This is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x and z are connected.
EC(x,z) - externally connected: This is not possible because, as I've argued, x cannot touch the boundary of z.
PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is not possible because x is entirely inside z, so there's no part of x outside of z.
TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This is not possible because, as I've argued, x cannot touch the boundary of z.
NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: This is the relationship I've concluded is the only possible one.
TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is not possible because x is inside z, not the other way around.
NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is not possible for the same reason as above.
EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x is strictly inside z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me use a simple visual example to verify. Consider three nested circles: x inside y inside z. TPP(x,y) means the boundary of x touches the boundary of y. NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z. Given this arrangement, x is also completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z, so NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I would like to verify this by considering the set of inference rules of the RCC-8 calculus, to be sure.

Let me think about this problem from a more formal perspective. Given the RCC-8 relations, we can infer the possible relations between x and z based on the known relations TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) using the composition table of RCC-8.

The composition of two relations, R1(x,y) and R2(y,z), denoted as R1 ∘ R2, gives the possible relations between x and z. In our case, we want to find TPP ∘ NTPP.

I don't have a reference for the RCC-8 composition table handy, but I recall that the composition TPP ∘ NTPP results in NTPP. This is because if x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

I'm quite confident that the only possible relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Let me think about this from yet another angle.

In terms of set theory, if I denote the interiors of the regions as int(x), int(y), and int(z), and the boundaries as ∂x, ∂y, and ∂z, then:

TPP(x,y) means:
- int(x) ∪ ∂x ⊂ int(y) ∪ ∂y
- (int(x) ∪ ∂x) ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅ (x touches the boundary of y)

NTPP(y,z) means:
- int(y) ∪ ∂y ⊂ int(z)
- (int(y) ∪ ∂y) ∩ ∂z = ∅ (y doesn't touch the boundary of z)

From these, we can deduce that:
- int(x) ∪ ∂x ⊂ int(y) ∪ ∂y ⊂ int(z)
- (int(x) ∪ ∂x) ∩ ∂z = ∅ (x doesn't touch the boundary of z)

This gives us NTPP(x,z).

With all these different ways of looking at the problem, I am now absolutely confident that the only possible relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'd like to double-check using the precise definition of these relations, to be even more confident.

For regions x and y in a topological space, the RCC-8 relations can be defined as:

- DC(x,y): x ∩ y = ∅
- EC(x,y): int(x) ∩ int(y) = ∅ and x ∩ y ≠ ∅
- PO(x,y): int(x) ∩ int(y) ≠ ∅, x ⊈ y, and y ⊈ x
- TPP(x,y): x ⊂ y, x ≠ y, and x ∩ comp(y) ≠ ∅ (where comp(y) is the complement of y)
- NTPP(x,y): x ⊂ int(y)
- TPPi(x,y): TPP(y,x)
- NTPPi(x,y): NTPP(y,x)
- EQ(x,y): x = y

Actually, I think I've made an error in the definition of TPP. Let me correct it:

- TPP(x,y): x ⊂ y, x ≠ y, and x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅ (where ∂y is the boundary of y)

Now, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we have:
- x ⊂ y, x ≠ y, and x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅
- y ⊂ int(z)

From these, it follows that:
- x ⊂ y ⊂ int(z)
- Therefore, x ⊂ int(z), which is the definition of NTPP(x,z).

I'm now completely confident that the only possible relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me revise this further to be absolutely sure.

In RCC-8, the definitions of TPP and NTPP are:

- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x is connected to the complement of y. This means x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x is not connected to the complement of y. This means x doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we have:
- x is a proper part of y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- y is a proper part of z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

From these, it follows that:
- x is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of z, so x is a proper part of z.
- y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x is inside y, so x also doesn't touch the boundary of z.

These two conditions match the definition of NTPP(x,z).

I'm completely confident in my answer now. The only possible relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, I just realized that I used the correct definition of TPP after all, but I expressed it differently.

To clarify, in the topological interpretation of RCC-8:

- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x touches the boundary of y. Mathematically, x ⊂ y, x ≠ y, and x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x doesn't touch the boundary of y. Mathematically, x ⊂ int(y).

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we have:
- x ⊂ y, x ≠ y, and x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅.
- y ⊂ int(z).

From these, it follows that:
- x ⊂ y ⊂ int(z), so x ⊂ int(z), which is the definition of NTPP(x,z).

This reaffirms my conclusion that the only possible relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Oh, the constraints of TPP and NTPP may be a bit subtle, so let's make sure I have the correct definition.

In the RCC-8 calculus:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y (i.e., x ⊂ y and x ≠ y), and x touches the boundary of y (i.e., x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅).
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y (i.e., x ⊂ y and x ≠ y), and x does not touch the boundary of y (i.e., x ∩ ∂y = ∅). This is equivalent to saying x is a subset of the interior of y, i.e., x ⊂ int(y).

Given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we have:
- x ⊂ y, x ≠ y, and x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅.
- y ⊂ int(z), which means y ∩ ∂z = ∅.

From these, it follows that:
- x ⊂ y ⊂ int(z), so x ⊂ int(z), which means NTPP(x,z).

I've verified from several angles, and I'm now absolutely confident that the only possible relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think once more, to make sure I have the correct definition of the TPP relation. In TPP(x,y), x is a tangential proper part of y, which means:
1. x is a proper part of y (x ⊂ y and x ≠ y).
2. x touches the boundary of y (x ∩ ∂y ≠ ∅).

I need to be clear about what "touches the boundary" means. In the context of RCC-8, it means that there is at least one point of x that is also a point of the boundary of y. It does not mean that x extends beyond the boundary of y.

With this clarification, the rest of my reasoning stands: given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, to sum up:

If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm second-guessing myself. Let me think a bit more about the case where x could be a very complex shape.

Suppose x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x touches the boundary of y. And y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is strictly inside z without touching its boundary.

Could x possibly touch the boundary of z? The only way this could happen is if x somehow extends beyond the boundary of y, but this would contradict the fact that x is a proper part of y. So, x cannot touch the boundary of z.

This confirms again that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

I've thought about this from multiple angles, and I am now completely confident that the only possible relationship between x and z, given TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me verify with a simple example to be sure. Consider three nested circles:
- z is the outermost circle.
- y is a circle inside z, not touching the boundary of z.
- x is a circle inside y, touching the boundary of y at a point.

In this scenario, x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, confirming NTPP(x,z).

I've exhausted all the perspectives I can think of, and I'm now completely confident that the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Let me now format my answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the relationship between x and z based on the given relationships:

1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning:
   - x is completely contained within y
   - x touches y's boundary

2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning:
   - y is completely contained within z
   - y does not touch z's boundary (y is in z's interior)

Since x is contained within y, and y is contained within z's interior, it follows that x must be contained within z's interior.

Since y doesn't touch z's boundary and x is inside y, x cannot reach or touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
