PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

First, let's understand what we know:
- PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which is equivalent to TPP(z,y). This means that z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's think about what the possible relationships between x and z could be:

Since z is contained within y (because TPP(z,y)), and x partially overlaps with y (because PO(x,y)), there are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. x and z might be disconnected (DC): This can happen if the part of y that contains z doesn't overlap with the part of y that overlaps with x.

2. x and z might be externally connected (EC): This can occur if x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

3. x and z might partially overlap (PO): This can happen if x and z share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. z might be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)): This can happen if z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary.

5. z might be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)): This can happen if z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

6. x might be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)): This can happen if x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

7. x might be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)): This can happen if x is fully contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

8. x and z might be equal (EQ(x,z)): This can happen if x and z coincide exactly.

Let's analyze each of these possibilities to see which ones are consistent with the given conditions:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. If z is contained in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x, then x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. If z touches the boundary of y at a point where x also touches y, then x and z can be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. If z overlaps with the part of y that also overlaps with x, then x and z can partially overlap.

4. TPP(z,x): This is possible. If z is fully contained in the part of y that overlaps with x, and z touches the boundary of this overlap, then z can be a tangential proper part of x.

5. NTPP(z,x): This is possible. If z is fully contained in the part of y that overlaps with x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of this overlap, then z can be a non-tangential proper part of x.

6. TPP(x,z): Wait, this doesn't seem possible. Since z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), z is fully contained in y. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would also be fully contained in y. But we know that PO(x,y), which means that x is not fully contained in y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPP(x,z): Similar to the reasoning above, this doesn't seem possible. If x were a non-tangential proper part of z, then x would be fully contained in z, which is fully contained in y. This would mean x is fully contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): This also doesn't seem possible. If x and z were equal, then since z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), x would also be a tangential proper part of y. But we know that PO(x,y), which means that x is not a proper part of y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me check this reasoning once more to be sure, focusing on the cases I thought weren't possible.

6. TPP(x,z): I said this wasn't possible because if x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would be fully contained in y (since z is fully contained in y), contradicting PO(x,y). But actually, I need to be more careful here. PO(x,y) means that x and y share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other. So x is not fully contained in y, and some part of x is outside of y.

If TPP(x,z), then x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. So if x is fully contained in z, then x is also fully contained in y. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which means that x is not fully contained in y. So TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

7. NTPP(x,z): Similar to the reasoning above, if NTPP(x,z), then x is fully contained in z, which is fully contained in y. This would mean x is fully contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z were equal, then since TPP(z,y), we would also have TPP(x,y). But this contradicts PO(x,y), which means that x is not a proper part of y. So EQ(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Actually, I'm a bit confused about my logic. Let me reconsider the definition of PO.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. 

So if PO(x,y), then:
1. x and y overlap (they share a part).
2. x is not a part of y.
3. y is not a part of x.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if the part of y that contains z doesn't overlap with the part of y that overlaps with x.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z touches the boundary of the part of y that overlaps with x.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if z overlaps with the part of y that also overlaps with x, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(z,x): This is possible if z is fully contained in the part of y that overlaps with x, and z touches the boundary of x.

5. NTPP(z,x): This is possible if z is fully contained in the part of y that overlaps with x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

6. TPP(x,z): If TPP(x,z), then x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. So if x is fully contained in z, then x is also fully contained in y. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which means that x is not fully contained in y. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPP(x,z): Similar to the reasoning above, if NTPP(x,z), then x is fully contained in z, which is fully contained in y. This would mean x is fully contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z were equal, then since TPP(z,y), we would also have TPP(x,y). But this contradicts PO(x,y), which means that x is not a proper part of y. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me actually draw out pictures to verify.

We know that PO(x,y), so x and y share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other. Let's represent x and y as overlapping circles.

We also know that TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y). So z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. Let's represent z as a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary.

Now, let's consider the different possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if z is contained in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

y
+---------------+
|               |
|       z       |
|     +---+     |
|     |   |     |      x
|     +---+     |  +-------+
|               |  |       |
+---------------+  |       |
                   +-------+

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches the boundary of the part of y that overlaps with x.

y
+---------------+
|               |
|   z           |    x
|  +--+         | +-----+
|  |  |         | |     |
|  +--+         | |     |
|               | |     |
+---------------+ +-----+
                     
                     
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z overlaps with the part of y that also overlaps with x, but neither is fully contained in the other.

y
+---------------+
|               |
|    z          |    x
|  +----+       | +------+
|  |    |       | |      |
|  |  +-----------+      |
|  |    |       | |      |
|  +----+       | +------+
|               |
+---------------+
                     
4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is fully contained in the part of y that overlaps with x, and z touches the boundary of x.

y
+---------------+
|               |       x
|               |  +----------+
|        +---------|----+     |
|        |      |  |    |     |
|        |  z   |  |    |     |
|        +---------|----+     |
|               |  |          |
+---------------+  +----------+
                     
5. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is fully contained in the part of y that overlaps with x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

y
+---------------+
|               |       x
|               |  +----------+
|          +----|--|---+      |
|          |    |  |   |      |
|          |  z |  |   |      |
|          +----|--|---+      |
|               |  |          |
+---------------+  +----------+
                     

These pictures confirm that the following relationships between x and z are possible: DC, EC, PO, TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Let's see if any of the other relationships are possible:

6. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. Let's try to draw this:

y
+---------------+
|               |
|       z       |
|    +-----+    |
|    |     |    |
|    | x   |    |
|    |     |    |
|    +-----+    |
|               |
+---------------+

But in this picture, x is fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to the above, this would mean x is fully contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This would mean x is a tangential proper part of y, contradicting PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, wait, I made an error again. Let me try to draw the pictures more accurately. I keep making errors when I'm drawing the pictures, by placing z fully within y even though the relationship is TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y).

Let's define the relationships again:

- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y,z) means that TPP(z,y), which means that z is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.

So y is not a part of z, but z is a part of y and touches its boundary.

Given these relationships, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z don't share any parts. For example, if x overlaps with a part of y that doesn't include z.

    y
  +-----+
  |     |        x
  |  z  |     +-----+
  | +-+ |     |     |
  | | | |     |     |
  | +-+ |     |     |
  |     |     |     |
  +-----+     +-----+

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

    y
  +-----+
  |     |        x
  |  z  |     +-----+
  | +-+ |     |     |
  | | | +-----+     |
  | +-+ |     |     |
  |     |     |     |
  +-----+     +-----+

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.

    y
  +-----+
  |     |        x
  |  z  |     +-----+
  | +---+-----+     |
  | |   |     |     |
  | +---+-----+     |
  |     |     |     |
  +-----+     +-----+

4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean that z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. But since z is also fully contained in y and touches y's boundary, this would mean that x and y share at least all of z, and possibly more. But if x and y share all of z, and z touches y's boundary, then either y is a part of x (which contradicts PO(x,y)), or y touches x's boundary at the same point where z touches y's boundary.

Hmm, actually I'm making this too complicated. Let's draw the pictures differently, thinking of the TPPi relationship in a different way.

Since TPPi(y,z), we know that TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary.

And since PO(x,y), x and y share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Actually, let me just try to enumerate all possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if the part of y that contains z doesn't overlap with the part of y that overlaps with x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches the boundary of the part of y that overlaps with x.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z overlaps with the part of y that also overlaps with x, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is fully contained in the part of y that overlaps with x, and z touches the boundary of x.

5. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is fully contained in the part of y that overlaps with x, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

6. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. But since z is fully contained in y, x would also be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to the reasoning above, this would mean x is fully contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This would mean x is a tangential proper part of y, contradicting PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Now, let me think about TPP(z,x) again to be completely sure. This means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is also fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. 

Is this consistent with PO(x,y)? PO(x,y) means that x and y share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other. If z is fully contained in both x and y, then x and y do share a part (specifically, they share at least z). The question is whether this implies that either x is fully contained in y or y is fully contained in x.

If z is a tangential proper part of x, then x is larger than z. And if z is a tangential proper part of y, then y is larger than z. So neither x nor y is fully contained in the other based just on the fact that they both contain z. So TPP(z,x) is consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(z,y).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I'm now pretty confident that these are all the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

Let me double-check TPPi(z,x), which is equivalent to TPP(x,z). This would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z, so x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. So if x is fully contained in z, then x is also fully contained in y. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which means that x is not fully contained in y. So TPP(x,z) (or equivalently, TPPi(z,x)) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPP(x,z), would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would imply that x is fully contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) (or equivalently, NTPPi(z,x)) is not possible.

And finally, EQ(x,z) would mean that x and z are equal. Since TPP(z,y), this would mean that x is a tangential proper part of y, contradicting PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The final list of possible relations between x and z is: DC, EC, PO, TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x).

Wait, let me check whether TPP(z,x) is really possible. If TPP(z,x), then z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is also fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. 

Is this consistent with PO(x,y)? PO(x,y) means that x and y share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other. If z is fully contained in both x and y, then x and y do share a part (they share at least z). And since z touches both x's boundary and y's boundary, it's quite possible that x extends beyond y in some areas and y extends beyond x in others, which is consistent with neither being fully contained in the other.

So TPP(z,x) is indeed consistent with the given constraints.

Similarly, NTPP(z,x) would mean that z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is also fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. This is also consistent with PO(x,y) for similar reasons as above.

So, to conclude, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

But actually, wait, I just realized there's a confusion in my reasoning. I keep stating that TPP(z,y) means z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. That's correct. But I then repeatedly draw pictures showing z as a small region fully inside y, not on the boundary of y. If z is a tangential proper part of y, then z should touch the boundary of y.

Alright let me try the drawings again and be clearer about the topological relationships.

Since TPPi(y,z), which is equivalent to TPP(z,y), we know that z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. And since PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Let's consider the different possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if the part of y that contains z doesn't overlap with the part of y that overlaps with x.

      y
  +-------------+
  |             |
  |   z         |          x
  |  +--+       |      +-------+
  |  |  |       |      |       |
  |  +--+       |      |       |
  |             |      |       |
  +-------------+      +-------+

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z touches the boundary of the part of y that overlaps with x.

      y
  +-------------+
  |             |
  |   z         |          x
  |  +--+       |      +-------+
  |  |  |       +------+       |
  |  +--+       |      |       |
  |             |      |       |
  +-------------+      +-------+

But actually, this example is inconsistent with TPP(z,y), because z should touch the boundary of y, but it doesn't in my picture. Here's a corrected version:

      y
  +-------------+
  |             |
  |   z         |          x
  |  +--+       |      +-------+
  |  |  |       +------+       |
  |  +--+       |      |       |
  |    |        |      |       |
  +----+--------+      +-------+

And actually, in this corrected version, z and x aren't externally connected, they're disconnected. Let me try again:

      y
  +-------------+
  |             |
  |             |          x
  |     z       |      +-------+
  |    +--+     +------+       |
  |    |  |     |      |       |
  |    +--+     |      |       |
  |      |      |      |       |
  +------+------+      +-------+

No, this still shows z and x as disconnected. One more try:

      y
  +-------------+
  |             |
  |             |          x
  |     z       |      +-------+
  |    +--+     +------+       |
  |    |  +-----+      |       |
  |    +--+     |      |       |
  |             |      |       |
  +-------------+      +-------+

Wait, this doesn't look right for EC(x,z) either. In this picture, z and x overlap, which would be PO(x,z), not EC(x,z).

OK I think I'm making things too complicated by trying to draw pictures. Let me just reason about this logically:

- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary at at least one point.
- PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Now, let's consider the different possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if the part of y that contains z doesn't overlap with the part of y that overlaps with x. For example, if z is in one part of y, and the overlap between x and y is in a different part of y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if z and x touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This can happen if z touches the boundary of y at a point where x also touches y, but x and y don't overlap at that point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z overlaps with the part of y that also overlaps with x, but neither z nor x is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary, and x extends beyond y in some areas.

5. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and x extends beyond y in some areas.

6. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary. But since z is fully contained in y, x would also be fully contained in y, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to the reasoning above, this would mean x is fully contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This would mean x is a tangential proper part of y, contradicting PO(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me think about EC(x,z) again. EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Now, since TPP(z,y), z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. And since PO(x,y), x and y share some interior part. 

Is it possible for x and z to be externally connected? If z touches the boundary of y at a point, and x also touches y at the same point, then x and z would be externally connected. But this would mean that x and y only touch at a boundary, and don't share any interior part, which contradicts PO(x,y). 

Actually, wait. It could be that z touches the boundary of y at one point, and x touches the boundary of y at a different point, and x and z also touch each other at a third point. In this case, x and y would still share an interior part, and z would still be fully contained in y and touch y's boundary, and x and z would be externally connected. So EC(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me double-check PO(x,z) too. PO(x,z) means that x and z share some interior part, but neither is fully contained in the other. Since TPP(z,y), z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. And since PO(x,y), x and y share some interior part. 

Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap? If the part of y that overlaps with x also contains part of z, then x and z would share an interior part. And if x extends beyond y in some areas, and z extends to the boundary of y in other areas, then neither x nor z would be fully contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me double-check TPP(z,x) as well. TPP(z,x) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is also fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. 

Is this consistent with PO(x,y)? PO(x,y) means that x and y share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other. If z is fully contained in both x and y, then x and y do share a part (they share at least z). And if x extends beyond y in some areas, and y extends beyond x in others, then neither would be fully contained in the other. So TPP(z,x) is indeed consistent with the given constraints.

Finally, let me double-check NTPP(z,x). NTPP(z,x) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is fully contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since TPP(z,y), z is fully contained in y and touches y's boundary. 

Is this consistent with PO(x,y)? If z touches y's boundary but doesn't touch x's boundary, then x's boundary must be entirely outside of y at the point where z touches y's boundary. This is consistent with x extending beyond y in some areas, and y extending beyond x in others, which is what PO(x,y) implies. So NTPP(z,x) is also consistent with the given constraints.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So to summarize, the possible spatial relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some part, but neither is contained in the other
- TPPi(y,z): equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained in y and touches y's boundary)

I'll examine each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible: x and z can be disconnected if z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible: x and z can touch at their boundaries without sharing interior parts.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible: x and z can partially overlap if z intersects with the part of y that overlaps with x.

4. TPP(z,x) - Possible: z can be a tangential proper part of x if it's fully contained in x and touches x's boundary.

5. NTPP(z,x) - Possible: z can be a non-tangential proper part of x if it's fully contained in x without touching x's boundary.

6. TPPi(z,x) or TPP(x,z) - Not possible: This would mean x is contained in z, which is contained in y, making x contained in y, contradicting PO(x,y).

7. NTPPi(z,x) or NTPP(x,z) - Not possible: For the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible: If x equals z, then x would be a tangential proper part of y, contradicting PO(x,y).
