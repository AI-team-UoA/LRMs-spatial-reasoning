PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let's recall what NTPP means:
NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.

So we have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary

Since x is completely inside y, and y is completely inside z, this means that x must also be completely inside z. So x is definitely a proper part of z.

The question is whether x touches z's boundary or not. Since x doesn't even touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, it's clear that x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning.

We have:
- x is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary)
- y is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary)

This implies that x is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary), which is the definition of NTPP(x,z).

So the answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's carefully consider each of the eight RCC-8 relations to confirm that NTPP is the only possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This is not possible because x is inside y and y is inside z, so x must be inside z, meaning they are connected.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This is not possible because x would need to touch z's boundary, but x doesn't even touch y's boundary, and y is strictly inside z.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is not possible because x is completely inside z, not just partially.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: This is not possible because x would need to touch z's boundary, but as we established, x cannot touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: This is possible and actually the only possible relation, as we've established.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, which is impossible since x is inside y and y is inside z.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: This is not possible because x is strictly contained in y, and y is strictly contained in z, so x and z cannot be equal.

So the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I realize that I should be more careful about proving this. Let me make sure that NTPP(x,z) is indeed the only possible relation.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

This means:
- x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary
- y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary

For x to touch z's boundary, x would need to extend to at least the boundary of y, but NTPP(x,y) tells us that x doesn't even touch y's boundary. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), and x is strictly inside y, x cannot touch z's boundary.

So x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which is exactly the definition of NTPP(x,z).

So the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more careful about this. Let's consider more precisely what NTPP means in terms of point sets.

If we represent regions as sets of points:

NTPP(x,y) means:
1. x is a proper subset of y (x ⊂ y)
2. The closure of x is a proper subset of the interior of y (closure(x) ⊂ interior(y))

Similarly, NTPP(y,z) means:
1. y is a proper subset of z (y ⊂ z)
2. The closure of y is a proper subset of the interior of z (closure(y) ⊂ interior(z))

From these, we can derive:
1. x is a proper subset of y (x ⊂ y) and y is a proper subset of z (y ⊂ z), so x is a proper subset of z (x ⊂ z) by the transitivity of the subset relation.
2. The closure of x is a proper subset of the interior of y (closure(x) ⊂ interior(y)), and the interior of y is a subset of y, which is a proper subset of the interior of z (y ⊂ interior(z)). Therefore, the closure of x is a proper subset of the interior of z (closure(x) ⊂ interior(z)).

These two conditions exactly define NTPP(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

In conclusion, given NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what happens when we have a chain of NTPP relations.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary)

To identify the possible relationship between x and z, I'll analyze what this means spatially:
- x is completely contained within y
- y is completely contained within z
- x doesn't touch y's boundary
- y doesn't touch z's boundary

Since x is strictly inside y, and y is strictly inside z, then x must be strictly inside z. Furthermore, x cannot possibly touch z's boundary because:
1. x doesn't even touch y's boundary
2. y itself doesn't touch z's boundary

Therefore, x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which is exactly the definition of NTPP(x,z).
