PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this carefully. 

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary. So x is entirely contained in y, but some part of x touches the boundary of y.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is entirely contained in the other.

Now, we need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Let's go through the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected. Is it possible that x and z share no spatial parts? Well, x is entirely contained in y, and y shares some part with z. But that doesn't necessarily mean that x shares a part with z. x could be in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected. This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. Since x is entirely within y and touches y's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x touches z at a boundary where y and z meet. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping. This means x and z share some spatial part, but neither is entirely contained in the other. Since x is entirely within y, and y shares some part with z, it's possible that x overlaps with the part of z that overlaps with y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part. This means x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. Since x is entirely within y, and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x is entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z, and since x touches y's boundary, it might touch z's boundary as well (if the boundary of y that x touches is also a boundary of z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part. This means x is entirely contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Similarly to TPP(x,z), x could be entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z, but in this case, x doesn't touch any boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part. This means z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. But since x is entirely contained in y, and z is not entirely contained in y (because PO(y,z)), z cannot be entirely contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part. This means z is entirely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For the same reason as TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal. This means x and z are the same region. But since x is entirely contained in y, and z is not entirely contained in y (because PO(y,z)), x and z cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

For DC(x,z), we said it's possible if x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. But actually, if y and z partially overlap, and x is tangentially properly part of y, then x might be completely outside the overlap of y and z. So, DC(x,z) is indeed possible.

For EC(x,z), we said it's possible if x touches z at a boundary where y and z meet. This is correct. If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y and z are externally connected, then x and z will also be externally connected.

For PO(x,z), we said it's possible if x overlaps with the part of z that overlaps with y. This is correct. If part of x is in the overlap of y and z, and part of x is in y but not in z, then x and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z), we said it's possible if x is entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z, and x touches z's boundary. This is correct. If x is entirely within the overlap of y and z, and x touches the boundary of z (which could happen if it touches the boundary of y at a point where y and z overlap), then x is a tangential proper part of z.

For NTPP(x,z), we said it's possible if x is entirely within the part of y that overlaps with z, but x doesn't touch z's boundary. This is correct. If x is entirely within the overlap of y and z, and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

For TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z), we said they're not possible because x is entirely contained in y, but z is not (due to PO(y,z)). This reasoning is correct.

So, in summary, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me rethink the case of EC(x,z). 

TPP(x,y) means that x is entirely contained in y and touches y's boundary. 
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z need to touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. 

Since x is entirely contained in y, and y and z share some interior parts (because PO(y,z)), the only way for x and z to not share interior parts is if x is entirely outside the overlap of y and z.

But then, for x and z to touch at a boundary, x would need to touch z's boundary, which means x would need to touch the boundary of the overlap of y and z from the inside of y.

This is indeed possible. If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y and z are externally connected, then x and z will also be externally connected.

So, EC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, but let me think about DC(x,z) more carefully. 

TPP(x,y) means that x is entirely contained in y and touches y's boundary. 
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z need to be disconnected, meaning they share no spatial parts and don't even touch at a boundary.

Since x is entirely contained in y, and y and z share some interior parts (because PO(y,z)), the only way for x and z to be disconnected is if x is entirely outside the overlap of y and z.

But for x to be disconnected from z, x would need to not touch z's boundary, which means x would need to not touch the boundary of the overlap of y and z from the inside of y.

If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y and z are externally connected, then x and z would be externally connected, not disconnected.

So, the question is: can x touch the boundary of y at a point where y is not connected to z, while y and z still partially overlap elsewhere? 

Yes, this is possible. y and z could overlap in one region, while x is located in a different region of y and touches the boundary of y at a point where y is not connected to z.

So, DC(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Thinking about TPPi(x,z) again: 

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a tangential proper part of x, which means z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary.

But we already established that since x is entirely contained in y (due to TPP(x,y)), and z is not entirely contained in y (due to PO(y,z)), z cannot be entirely contained in x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

What about NTPPi(x,z)? For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is entirely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Again, since x is entirely contained in y, and z is not entirely contained in y, z cannot be entirely contained in x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

And for EQ(x,z)? For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be the same region.

Since x is entirely contained in y, and z is not entirely contained in y, x and z cannot be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the final list of possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more careful and draw out some examples for each of these cases to ensure they're possible.

For DC(x,z):
- y is a circle.
- x is a smaller circle entirely contained within y, touching y's boundary at one point.
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with y on the side opposite to where x is located.
In this case, x and z are disconnected.

For EC(x,z):
- y is a circle.
- x is a smaller circle entirely contained within y, touching y's boundary at one point.
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with y, and the boundary of z passes through the point where x touches y's boundary.
In this case, x and z are externally connected.

For PO(x,z):
- y is a circle.
- x is a smaller circle entirely contained within y, touching y's boundary at one point.
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with y, and the overlap of y and z contains part of x.
In this case, x and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z):
- y is a circle.
- x is a smaller circle entirely contained within y, touching y's boundary at one point.
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with y, and the overlap of y and z completely contains x, with x touching the boundary of z at one point.
In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z.

For NTPP(x,z):
- y is a circle.
- x is a smaller circle entirely contained within y, not touching y's boundary.
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with y, and the overlap of y and z completely contains x, with x not touching the boundary of z.
In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Wait, this last case doesn't work because TPP(x,y) means that x touches y's boundary, but in my example, x doesn't touch y's boundary. Let me revise this.

For NTPP(x,z):
- y is a circle.
- x is a smaller circle entirely contained within y, touching y's boundary at one point.
- z is another circle that partially overlaps with y, and the overlap of y and z completely contains x, with x not touching the boundary of z.

But this doesn't work either, because if x touches y's boundary and is entirely contained within the overlap of y and z, then x must also touch the boundary of z at the point where it touches y's boundary.

So, NTPP(x,z) may not be a possible relationship. Let me reconsider this.

Actually, I think I see the issue. I'm assuming that if x touches the boundary of y at a point, and x is entirely contained within the overlap of y and z, then x must also touch the boundary of z at that point. But this isn't necessarily true. The point where x touches y's boundary could be an interior point of z, in which case x wouldn't touch z's boundary.

Let's try this example:
- y is a circle.
- x is a smaller circle entirely contained within y, touching y's boundary at one point.
- z is another circle that properly contains the point where x touches y's boundary (so that point is an interior point of z), and z partially overlaps with y.

In this case, x is entirely contained within the overlap of y and z, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

OK so our final list of possible relationships is DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means: x is properly part of y and touches y's boundary
PO(y,z) means: y and z partially overlap (share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other)

Let me analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1) DC(x,z) - disconnected
   This is possible if x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.

2) EC(x,z) - externally connected
   This is possible if x touches the boundary of y at exactly where y and z meet.

3) PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
   This is possible if x overlaps with the region where y and z overlap, but isn't completely contained in that overlap.

4) TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part
   This is possible if x is completely within the y-z overlap region and touches the boundary of z.

5) NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part
   This is possible if x is completely within the y-z overlap region and doesn't touch z's boundary.

The other relations (TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ) are impossible because they would require z to be contained in x, which contradicts our given information since x is proper part of y while z extends beyond y.
