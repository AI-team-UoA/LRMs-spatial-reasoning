PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think about this step by step. We have:
- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts
- PO(y,z) means that y and z share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z. Let's consider each of the 8 possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   - This is possible. If x is disconnected from y, and y partially overlaps with z, then it's possible that x and z share no parts.
   - For example, imagine three circles: x on the left, y in the middle, and z on the right. y overlaps with z, but x doesn't touch either.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect (touch at boundary)
   - This is also possible. If x is disconnected from y, but x touches z at a boundary, while y partially overlaps with z.
   - For example, imagine x touching z at a single point, while y overlaps with a different part of z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   - This is possible. Even though x and y are disconnected, x could still overlap with z in a region that y doesn't overlap with.
   - Imagine z as a large area, with y overlapping one part of z, and x overlapping a completely different part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   - This is possible. x could be contained within z and touch z's boundary, while being completely separate from y, which partially overlaps with z elsewhere.
   - Imagine z as a large circle, x as a small circle inside z touching z's boundary, and y as another circle that overlaps with a different part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   - This is possible. x could be fully contained within z without touching z's boundary, and be completely separate from y, which partially overlaps with z elsewhere.
   - Imagine z as a large circle, x as a small circle fully inside z (not touching the boundary), and y as another circle that overlaps with a different part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   - This is possible. z could be contained within x and touch x's boundary, while y partially overlaps with z.
   - Imagine x as a large circle, z as a small circle inside x touching x's boundary, and y as another circle that partially overlaps with z but is disconnected from x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   - This is possible. z could be fully contained within x without touching x's boundary, while y partially overlaps with z.
   - Imagine x as a large circle, z as a small circle fully inside x (not touching the boundary), and y as another circle that partially overlaps with z but is disconnected from x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
   - This seems problematic. If x and z are equal, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would also partially overlap with x. But we know DC(x,y), which means x and y are disconnected.
   - So EQ(x,z) is not possible given our constraints.

Let me review this again for correctness:

Wait, I need to be more careful with some of these cases. Let me reconsider:

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z): If z is a part of x (either tangential or non-tangential), and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also overlap with x in that same region (since z is part of x). But this contradicts DC(x,y).

So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are actually not possible.

Let me re-analyze for the remaining relations:

1. DC(x,z): Clearly possible as explained before.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch z at a boundary while y overlaps with z in a different region.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z can share parts in regions that don't involve y.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be contained in z while being disconnected from y, which overlaps with z elsewhere.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be fully inside z without touching z's boundary, while y overlaps with z elsewhere.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also overlap with x (since z is inside x). This contradicts DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar to the previous point, if z is inside x and y overlaps with z, then y must overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also partially overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): disconnected
- EC(x,z): externally connected
- PO(x,z): partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Let me just double-check once more:

Wait, let me think about each relation carefully one more time, considering what we know:
- DC(x,y): x and y are completely disconnected
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap

For DC(x,z):
- This means x and z share no parts.
- This is clearly possible. Imagine y and z overlapping in one region, while x is completely separate.

For EC(x,z):
- This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
- This is possible. x can touch z at some point on z's boundary that is away from where y overlaps with z.

For PO(x,z):
- This means x and z partially overlap.
- This is possible. x can overlap with z in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

For TPP(x,z):
- This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- This is possible. x can be inside z, touching z's boundary, in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

For NTPP(x,z):
- This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- This is possible. x can be fully inside z, away from z's boundary, in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

For TPPi(x,z):
- This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- If z is inside x and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also overlap with x.
- But we know DC(x,y), so y can't overlap with x.
- Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- If z is inside x and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also overlap with x.
- But we know DC(x,y), so y can't overlap with x.
- Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z):
- This means x and z are the same region.
- If x and z are the same, and y partially overlaps with z, then y must also partially overlap with x.
- But we know DC(x,y), so y can't overlap with x.
- Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I need to reconsider the TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) cases more carefully:

For TPP(x,z):
- This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- Given that y partially overlaps with z, we need to check if this is consistent with DC(x,y).
- For DC(x,y), x and y must have no common points.
- Since PO(y,z), y shares some part with z.
- We need to ensure that the part of y that overlaps with z doesn't include x.
- This is possible. Imagine z as a large circle, x as a small circle inside z touching z's boundary, and y as another circle that overlaps with a different part of z without touching x.

For NTPP(x,z):
- This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- Similar to the TPP case, we need to ensure that the part of y that overlaps with z doesn't include x.
- This is possible. Imagine z as a large circle, x as a small circle fully inside z (not touching the boundary), and y as another circle that overlaps with a different part of z without touching x.

So I maintain that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible. Since x is disconnected from y, and y partially overlaps with z, x can be completely disconnected from z as well.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible. x can touch z at a boundary while remaining disconnected from y, which overlaps with z in a different region.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x can partially overlap with z in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z in a region that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible. If z is a proper part of x and y partially overlaps with z, then y would also overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible. If z is inside x and y overlaps with z, then y would also overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x equals z and y partially overlaps with z, then y would also partially overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).
