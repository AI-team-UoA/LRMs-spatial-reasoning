PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what we know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. Equivalently, NTPP(y,x) means y is a proper part of x and is not touching x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and is not touching y's boundary.

So we have:
- y is properly contained within x, not touching x's boundary
- z is properly contained within y, not touching y's boundary

What can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is properly contained within y (NTPP(y,z)), and y is properly contained within x (NTPPi(x,y) or NTPP(y,x)), it follows that z must also be properly contained within x.

Furthermore, since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary either. So z is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

This means that NTPP(z,x) must hold, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this. We have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x)
- NTPP(y,z) means z is properly contained in y

From this we want to determine the relation between x and z.

If y properly contains z (without z touching y's boundary), and x properly contains y (without y touching x's boundary), then x must properly contain z (without z touching x's boundary).

So the relation between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z) or equivalently NTPP(z,x).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me consider this once more with diagrams in mind:

NTPPi(x,y) means: x contains y as a proper part, with y not touching x's boundary.
Visually: x is a larger region completely surrounding y with some space between y and x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means: y contains z as a proper part, with z not touching y's boundary.
Visually: y is a larger region completely surrounding z with some space between z and y's boundary.

So together we have: x completely surrounds y, which completely surrounds z. There's space between x's boundary and y, and space between y's boundary and z.

From this, it's clear that x completely surrounds z with space between them. This corresponds to NTPPi(x,z) or equivalently NTPP(z,x).

I confirm that the answer is:

NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationship(s) can exist between x and z given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Following the composition of these relations:
- y is fully contained within x with a gap between y and x's boundary
- z is fully contained within y with a gap between z and y's boundary

Therefore, z must be fully contained within x with a gap between z and x's boundary (since z can't reach y's boundary, and y doesn't reach x's boundary).

This corresponds precisely to the NTPP relation from z to x, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).
