PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem step-by-step.

We are given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts

We need to find out what relationships are possible between x and z.

Let's consider all eight relations from the RCC-8 calculus:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal

Let me analyze which of these are possible:

DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. Imagine x and z as two circles that both touch y but are on opposite sides of y, not touching each other.

EC(x,z): This is also possible. Imagine x and z as two circles that both touch y and also touch each other at a point.

PO(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and z as overlapping circles, both touching y at their boundaries.

TPP(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x as a circle inside z, touching z's boundary, and y touches both x and z at that same boundary point.

NTPP(x,z): This seems impossible. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then how can x touch y's boundary while y touches z's boundary? This would require y to extend inside z to touch x, but then y and z would have to overlap, not just touch at boundary.

TPPi(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is possible. Imagine z as a circle inside x, touching x's boundary, and y touches both x and z at that same boundary point.

NTPPi(x,z): For the same reason as NTPP, this seems impossible. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, how can y touch both z and x's boundary?

EQ(x,z): This is possible. If x and z are identical, they can both touch y at the same boundary points.

Let me double-check my reasoning by thinking about concrete examples or counterexamples:

For NTPP(x,z), if x is strictly inside z, then for x to touch y, y must penetrate into z, which means y and z would have interior overlap, contradicting EC(y,z).

For NTPPi(x,z), similarly, if z is strictly inside x, then for z to touch y, y must penetrate into x, contradicting EC(x,y).

So the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me rethink the TPP and TPPi cases more carefully. 

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. For EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x at x's boundary. For EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z at z's boundary. This seems consistent since x touches z's boundary, so y could touch both x and z at that same boundary point.

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. For EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z at z's boundary. For EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x at x's boundary. Again, this seems consistent as z touches x's boundary.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are identical, then y touches both at the same boundary points, which is consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Actually, let me reconsider the PO(x,z) case. If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points. Both x and z must touch y at their boundaries. This seems possible if y touches both x and z at points on their boundaries that are not in the overlap region.

So, my answer stands: the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider TPP(x,z) more carefully. If x is a tangential proper part of z, and EC(x,y) holds, then y touches x at x's boundary. Some part of x's boundary is also a part of z's boundary (where x touches z). If y touches x at this common boundary, then y would also touch z at the same point. This seems consistent.

But if y touches x at a part of x's boundary that is in z's interior, then y would have to penetrate z to reach x, which would contradict EC(y,z) because y and z would have interior overlap.

So for TPP(x,z) to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch x at the part of x's boundary that coincides with z's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z), a similar analysis applies.

Hmm, I think I'm starting to overthink this. Let me reconsider more systematically.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at boundaries, no interior overlap.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at boundaries, no interior overlap.

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is definitely possible. Y can touch x at one point on its boundary and touch z at a different point on its boundary, with x and z being separated.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at boundaries, no interior overlap. This is also possible. Y can touch both x and z at the points where they touch each other.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. If this is the case, then y must touch both x and z at their boundaries, but these touch points cannot be in the region where x and z overlap (otherwise y would have interior overlap with either x or z). This seems geometrically possible.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. For EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch x at a part of x's boundary that coincides with z's boundary. Otherwise, y would have to penetrate z to reach x, contradicting EC(y,z). This seems geometrically possible.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is impossible because for EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x at x's boundary, but since x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, y would have to penetrate z to reach x, contradicting EC(y,z).

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. Similar to the TPP case, y must touch z at a part of z's boundary that coincides with x's boundary. This seems geometrically possible.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because for EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z at z's boundary, but since z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, y would have to penetrate x to reach z, contradicting EC(x,y).

EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is possible because if x and z are identical, they can both touch y at the same boundary points.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

But let's carefully double-check each of these again:

DC(x,z): Clearly possible. Imagine three circles in a row, where the middle one (y) touches both outer ones (x and z), but the outer ones don't touch each other.

EC(x,z): Clearly possible. Imagine three circles arranged in a triangle, each touching the other two at boundary points.

PO(x,z): This is tricky. If x and z partially overlap, their boundaries intersect. For EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch both x and z at their boundaries, but not in the overlap region. I think this is geometrically possible. For example, imagine x and z as overlapping circles, and y as a circle that touches both x and z at points outside their overlap.

TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, it touches z's boundary from the inside. For EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch both x and z at points on their boundaries. This seems possible if y touches both x and z at the point where x touches z's boundary from the inside. 

TPPi(x,z): Similar reasoning as TPP, just with the roles of x and z reversed. This seems possible.

EQ(x,z): If x and z are identical, then any point where y touches x is also a point where y touches z, so EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) imply the same thing. This is possible.

One more time, I'm concerned about whether PO(x,z) is truly possible. Let's think:

If x and z partially overlap, they share interior points and their boundaries intersect. For EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x at x's boundary without sharing interior points. Similarly, for EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z at z's boundary without sharing interior points. 

Now, if y touches x at a point on x's boundary that is not in the overlap region with z, and y touches z at a point on z's boundary that is not in the overlap region with x, then both EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) hold, and PO(x,z) is possible.

Thinking more concretely: imagine x and z as two overlapping circles, and y as a third circle that touches x at a point on x's boundary that is outside z, and touches z at a point on z's boundary that is outside x. This satisfies EC(x,y), EC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

Similar reasoning confirms that TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are all possible alongside EC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Actually, let me double-check TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) once more:

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary. For EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x at x's boundary without overlapping x's interior. For EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z at z's boundary without overlapping z's interior. Since part of x's boundary coincides with z's boundary (where x touches z), y could touch both x and z at this common boundary point, satisfying both EC relations.

But there's a subtlety: if y touches x at a part of x's boundary that is in z's interior, then y would have to penetrate z to reach x, which would contradict EC(y,z) because y and z would share interior points.

So for TPP(x,z) to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch x at the part of x's boundary that coincides with z's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z), a similar analysis applies, with the roles of x and z reversed.

Upon further reflection, I'm not sure if TPP(x,z) is truly possible. Let's reconsider:

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. EC(x,y) means x and y touch at boundaries without interior overlap. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at boundaries without interior overlap.

Now, for y to touch x at x's boundary, y would either have to touch x at the point where x touches z's boundary (which would mean y also touches z at that point), or y would have to penetrate z to reach x at a different part of x's boundary. The latter would contradict EC(y,z).

So, for TPP(x,z) to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch both x and z at the exact point where x touches z's boundary from the inside. This seems like a very specific arrangement, but it is geometrically possible.

Similarly, for TPPi(x,z), y must touch both x and z at the exact point where z touches x's boundary from the inside.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me approach it more systematically one final time:

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at boundaries, no interior overlap.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at boundaries, no interior overlap.

Given these, what are the possible relations between x and z?

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if y touches x at one point on its boundary and touches z at a different point on its boundary, with x and z being separated.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at boundaries, no interior overlap. This is possible if y touches both x and z at or near the points where x and z touch each other.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch x at a point on x's boundary that is not in the overlap region with z, and y must touch z at a point on z's boundary that is not in the overlap region with x. This is geometrically possible.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch x at the point where x touches z's boundary from the inside, and this same point is where y touches z. This is a specific arrangement but is geometrically possible.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is impossible because for EC(x,y) to hold, y must touch x at x's boundary, but since x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, y would have to penetrate z to reach x, contradicting EC(y,z).

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. Similar to TPP, for this to be consistent with EC(x,y) and EC(y,z), y must touch z at the point where z touches x's boundary from the inside, and this same point is where y touches x. This is geometrically possible.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because for EC(y,z) to hold, y must touch z at z's boundary, but since z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, y would have to penetrate x to reach z, contradicting EC(x,y).

EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is possible because if x and z are identical, then EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) describe the same relationship.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. TPPi(x,z)
6. EQ(x,z)

These are my final conclusions.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when EC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are given.

Looking at each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x and z can be disconnected regions that both externally connect to y at different points (imagine three circles in a row, where the middle one touches both outer ones).

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x and z can touch at their boundaries while both externally connecting to y (imagine three circles arranged in a triangle, each touching the other two).

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap while both externally connect to y at points outside their overlap region.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a tangential proper part of z, with y connecting to both at the exact point where x touches z's boundary from inside.

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible - if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y would have to penetrate z's interior to reach x, contradicting EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a tangential proper part of x, with y connecting to both at the exact point where z touches x's boundary from inside.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible - if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would have to penetrate x's interior to reach z, contradicting EC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Possible - if x and z are identical, y can externally connect to both at the same points.
