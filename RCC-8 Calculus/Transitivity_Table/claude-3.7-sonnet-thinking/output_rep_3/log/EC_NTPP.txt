PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what we know:
- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about this systematically by considering what we know about the spatial arrangements.

EC(x,y) means:
- x and y touch only at their boundaries
- They don't overlap in their interiors

NTPP(y,z) means:
- y is completely inside z
- y doesn't touch z's boundary (it's strictly inside)

Given these constraints, what are the possible ways x and z can relate?

Since y is strictly inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, x could:
1. Be disconnected from z (DC)
   This is impossible because x touches y's boundary, and y is strictly inside z, so x must at least touch z or be partially inside z.

2. Touch z at the boundary (EC)
   This is possible if x touches y's boundary at a point where y is close to z's boundary, but not touching it. Then x could extend outside of z while just touching z's boundary.

3. Partially overlap with z (PO)
   This is possible if x touches y's boundary but also extends both inside and outside of z.

4. Be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)
   This is possible if x touches y's boundary and is completely contained within z, touching z's boundary.

5. Be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)
   This is possible if x touches y's boundary but is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Options 6, 7, and 8 (TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) all require z to be contained in or equal to x, which contradicts our knowledge that y is strictly inside z and x only touches y at the boundary. So these are impossible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But let me think through this more carefully to make sure.

Actually, I need to reconsider. If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If x only touches y at their boundary, then x must at least enter z to touch y. So DC(x,z) is definitely impossible.

For EC(x,z), x would have to touch z only at z's boundary. But this means x wouldn't be able to reach y inside z without overlapping with z. So EC(x,z) is also impossible.

For PO(x,z), x would partially overlap with z. Since y is strictly inside z, x would need to extend inside z to touch y's boundary, and also extend outside z. This seems possible.

For TPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z but touch z's boundary. Since y is strictly inside z without touching the boundary, x can touch y's boundary and still touch z's boundary. This seems possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if x only touches y's boundary and remains inside z without reaching z's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z), z would have to be a tangential proper part of x. But we know y is strictly inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary. This arrangement would require x to completely contain z, which means x would have to overlap with y, not just touch it at the boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) and EQ(x,z) are impossible because they would require x to contain or equal z, which would mean x overlaps with y, contradicting EC(x,y).

Let me check once more:

1. PO(x,z): x extends both inside and outside z, and the part inside touches y's boundary. Possible.
2. TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y's boundary. Possible.
3. NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z, doesn't touch z's boundary, but touches y's boundary. Possible.

So the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I need to be extremely careful here. Let's analyze this situation with even more precision.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch only at their boundaries
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Let's consider each RCC-8 relation possibility for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   If x is disconnected from z, then x cannot reach y which is strictly inside z. This contradicts EC(x,y). So DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch only at their boundaries
   If x only touches z at the boundary, then x cannot reach y which is strictly inside z without overlapping z. This contradicts EC(x,y). So EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This means part of x is inside z and part is outside. The part inside z can touch y's boundary (satisfying EC(x,y)), while still having part of x outside z. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. x can still touch y's boundary inside z. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. x can still touch y's boundary inside z. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But since y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), this would mean parts of y are inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   Similar to the above, this would mean z (and therefore y) is completely inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical
   If x equals z, then y would be strictly inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

So my final answer is:

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given the constraints:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch only at their boundaries
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible - x touches y which is inside z, so x must have some connection to z.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible - if x only touched z's boundary, it couldn't reach y which is strictly inside z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially overlap z, with part inside z touching y's boundary and part outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z touching z's boundary while also touching y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z, away from z's boundary, while touching y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible - this would require z to be inside x, but y is inside z and only touches x at boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible - same reasoning as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible - if x equals z, then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
