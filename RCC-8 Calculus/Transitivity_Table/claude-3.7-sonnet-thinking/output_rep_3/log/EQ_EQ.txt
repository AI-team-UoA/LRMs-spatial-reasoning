PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z, given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Let's think about what this means:
- If x and y occupy exactly the same space, and
- y and z occupy exactly the same space,
- Then logically, x and z must also occupy exactly the same space.

This is because the EQ relation is transitive. If x = y and y = z, then x = z.

So the relationship between x and z must be EQ(x,z), meaning x and z are coincident.

This is the only possible relationship, since the RCC-8 relations are mutually exclusive (an object pair can only have one relation at a time), and given the constraints, only EQ satisfies the conditions.

ANSWER:

If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then I need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (occupy exactly the same space)
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (occupy exactly the same space)

Given that x and y occupy exactly the same space, and y and z occupy exactly the same space, it follows that x and z must also occupy exactly the same space.

The relation EQ is transitive: if x equals y and y equals z, then x equals z.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
