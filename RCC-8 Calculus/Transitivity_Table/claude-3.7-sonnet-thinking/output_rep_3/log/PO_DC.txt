PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this. 

We have two facts:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
2. DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected. They don't share any spatial parts.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given PO(x,y), we know that x has some part that overlaps with y, and some part that doesn't overlap with y.

Given DC(y,z), we know that y and z have no spatial overlap whatsoever.

Let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. Can x and z be disconnected (DC)? 
   Yes, it's possible that x is entirely disconnected from z. Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is disconnected from z, the part of x that overlaps with y must be disconnected from z. The part of x that doesn't overlap with y could also be disconnected from z.

2. Can x and z be externally connected (EC)?
   Yes, it's possible. The part of x that doesn't overlap with y could touch z at a boundary.

3. Can x and z partially overlap (PO)?
   Yes, it's possible. The part of x that doesn't overlap with y could overlap with z.

4. Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)?
   Yes, it's possible. The part of x that doesn't overlap with y could be contained within z, and x could touch z's boundary.

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)?
   Yes, it's possible. The part of x that doesn't overlap with y could be entirely contained within the interior of z.

6. Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)?
   Let's think about this. If z is a proper part of x, then all of z is contained in x. And since y and z are disconnected, z must be entirely contained in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y is large enough to contain z, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)?
   Similar to the previous case, z could be entirely contained in the interior of the part of x that doesn't overlap with y.

8. Can x and z be equal (EQ)?
   No, this is not possible. If x and z were equal, then z would have to overlap with y (because x partially overlaps with y). But we know that y and z are disconnected, so x and z cannot be equal.

Let me verify these conclusions by thinking about specific spatial configurations.

For DC(x,z):
Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles, and z as a circle completely separate from both x and y. This satisfies PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), and results in DC(x,z).

For EC(x,z):
Imagine x and y as two overlapping circles, and z as a circle that touches x at a point on its boundary but is completely separate from y. This satisfies PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), and results in EC(x,z).

For PO(x,z):
Imagine x as a circle that partially overlaps with y, and z as a circle that partially overlaps with x but is completely separate from y. This satisfies PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), and results in PO(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine x as a small circle that partially overlaps with y, and z as a larger circle that contains x and touches x's boundary, but is completely separate from y. This satisfies PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), and results in TPP(x,z).

Wait, I need to think more carefully about this case. If x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), then all of x is contained in z. But we know that part of x overlaps with y, and y is disconnected from z. This leads to a contradiction: the part of x that overlaps with y cannot be both part of z and disconnected from z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible either, for the same reason.

For TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle that partially overlaps with x, and z as a small circle entirely contained within x and touching x's boundary, but completely separate from y. This satisfies PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), and results in TPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle that partially overlaps with x, and z as a small circle entirely contained within the interior of x, but completely separate from y. This satisfies PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), and results in NTPPi(x,z).

I need to revise my earlier analysis. 

Let's revisit TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):

For TPP(x,z), if x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then all of x is contained in z. But part of x overlaps with y, and y is disconnected from z. This is a contradiction, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then all of x is contained in z. Again, this contradicts the fact that part of x overlaps with y, and y is disconnected from z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Let me think again to make sure I haven't missed anything or made any errors.

Actually, let me think through this more carefully by considering the constraints on the regions.

1. PO(x,y) means x and y share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
2. DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Let's denote the part of x that overlaps with y as x∩y, and the part of x that doesn't overlap with y as x-y.

Since y and z are disconnected, any part of x that overlaps with y (i.e., x∩y) must be disconnected from z. This means that x∩y and z are disjoint.

Now, the part of x that doesn't overlap with y (i.e., x-y) can have any relationship with z, as long as it doesn't contradict the fact that x∩y and z are disjoint.

Let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x-y and z are disjoint.
2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x-y and z are externally connected (they touch at a boundary).
3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x-y and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): This would mean that all of x is contained in z. But we know that x∩y is disjoint from z, so this is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this would mean that all of x is contained in the interior of z, which is not possible given that x∩y is disjoint from z.
6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that all of z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is entirely contained in x-y and touches the boundary of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that all of z is contained in the interior of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained in the interior of x-y.
8. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are identical. But since x∩y is disjoint from z, and x∩y is a non-empty part of x, x and z cannot be identical.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

I think my analysis is correct. The possible relations are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let me reconsider the TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) cases more carefully.

For TPP(x,z), if x is a tangential proper part of z, then all of x is contained in z and x touches the boundary of z. But part of x overlaps with y (i.e., x∩y), and y is disconnected from z. If all of x is contained in z, then x∩y must also be contained in z. But this contradicts the fact that y and z are disconnected, as it would mean that part of y (specifically, x∩y) is contained in z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then all of x is contained in the interior of z. Again, this means that x∩y must be contained in z, which contradicts the fact that y and z are disconnected. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So, I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I need to be more careful about the TPPi and NTPPi cases. Let me think again.

For TPPi(x,z), this means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is entirely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Since y and z are disconnected, z must be entirely contained in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y (i.e., x-y). This is possible if x-y is large enough to contain z, and z touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z), this means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is entirely contained in the interior of x. Again, since y and z are disconnected, z must be entirely contained in x-y. This is possible if x-y is large enough to contain z in its interior.

Both of these scenarios are possible, so TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are both valid possibilities.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me verify the TPPi case one more time by constructing a concrete example.

Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle that partially overlaps with the left side of x, and z as a small circle entirely contained within the right side of x and touching x's boundary. In this case, PO(x,y) is satisfied because x and y partially overlap. DC(y,z) is satisfied because y and z are disconnected. And TPPi(x,z) is satisfied because z is a tangential proper part of x (z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary).

This confirms that TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Similarly, we can construct an example for NTPPi(x,z) by placing z entirely within the interior of x and away from y.

So, the final list of possible relationships between x and z is:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPPi(x,z)
5. NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Since PO(x,y), x and y share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Since DC(y,z), y and z are completely disconnected.

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x could be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x could touch z at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. Part of x that doesn't overlap with y could overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were part of z, then the portion of x that overlaps with y would have to be in z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary, as long as z is in the portion of x that doesn't overlap with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be contained entirely in x's interior without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, then z would have to overlap with y (since x overlaps with y), contradicting DC(y,z).
