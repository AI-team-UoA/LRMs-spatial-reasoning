PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

Now we need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), they are essentially the same spatial region. This means that any spatial relationship that x has with y, x will also have with z.

Given that x is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPP(x,y)), and y is coincident with z (EQ(y,z)), it follows that x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Let's double-check this with the properties of RCC-8 relations:

If NTPP(x,y) then x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
If EQ(y,z) then y and z occupy exactly the same space.
Therefore, x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which is the definition of NTPP(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since y and z occupy exactly the same space (EQ(y,z)), they have identical boundaries and interiors. Therefore, any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Since x is a non-tangential proper part of y, x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
