PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between $x$ and $z$ given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). 

Let's break down what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now, let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z:

Since PO(x,y), x partly overlaps with y. And since NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z without touching its boundary. 

Let's consider the possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Is it possible that x and z don't share any parts? No, because x shares parts with y, and y is completely inside z. So x must share at least some parts with z.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Is it possible that x touches z only at the boundary? Since y is completely inside z without touching its boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), there must be a part of x that is inside z (the part that overlaps with y). So, it's possible that the rest of x extends outside of z and touches z's boundary. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

Wait, I need to reconsider EC(x,z). For EC to hold, x and z would need to touch at their boundaries without sharing any interior points. But we know that x and y share interior points (due to PO(x,y)), and y is completely inside z (due to NTPP(y,z)). This means that x and z must share interior points (specifically, the part of x that overlaps with y). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Is it possible that x and z partially overlap? Yes, x definitely shares some parts with z (the parts it shares with y), but it's also possible that some parts of x are outside of z. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part: Is it possible that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary? Yes, this is possible. x could overlap with y inside z and also extend to touch z's boundary without extending outside of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part: Is it possible that x is completely inside z without touching its boundary? Yes, this is possible. x could be completely inside z, just like y is.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that NTPP(y,z), z contains y completely, and y is not at z's boundary. If z were a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part: This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. As with TPPi, this would imply that y is a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. If x and z were the same, then PO(x,y) would imply PO(z,y), which contradicts NTPP(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, I just realized I made a mistake above. I said that EC(x,z) is possible, but then I immediately corrected myself and showed that it's not possible. Let me double-check my reasoning for the other relationships.

PO(x,z): x shares parts with y, and y is completely inside z. So x and z share some parts. It's also possible that parts of x extend outside of z. So PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

TPP(x,z): x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. This is consistent with PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

NTPP(x,z): x could be completely inside z without touching its boundary. This is also consistent with PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Let me verify again that TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible:

TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. But NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z. If z were a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Again, this would imply that y is a proper part of x, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): If x and z were the same, then PO(x,y) would imply PO(z,y), contradicting NTPP(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Wait, I need to reconsider DC(x,z) again. I said it's not possible because x shares parts with y, and y is completely inside z, so x must share at least some parts with z. This reasoning is correct, so DC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let me also reconsider EC(x,z). I said it's not possible because x and y share interior points, and y is completely inside z, so x and z must share interior points. This reasoning is correct, so EC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

So, the final list of possible relationships between x and z is:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, wait, I'm still unsure about my reasoning for EC(x,z). Let me try a different approach.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share some interior points, and neither is contained in the other. NTPP(y,z) means that y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to touch only at their boundaries without sharing any interior points. But we know that x shares interior points with y (due to PO(x,y)), and y is completely inside z (due to NTPP(y,z)). This means that x and z must share interior points (specifically, the part of x that overlaps with y). So, EC(x,z) is not possible because x and z must share interior points.

Actually, let me draw out what the scenarios might look like:
- PO(x,y): x and y overlap partially.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching the boundary.

For x and z:
- PO(x,z): x and z overlap partially. This is definitely possible, since the part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z, but the rest of x could be outside z.
- TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible.
- NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z without touching its boundary. This is also possible.

All of the other relationships (DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are not possible for the reasons I've stated.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

That's our final answer.

ANSWER:

Let me analyze what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Now I'll determine all possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible: Since x shares parts with y, and y is completely inside z, x must share at least those parts with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible: For EC to hold, x and z would only touch at boundaries without sharing interior points. But since x shares interior points with y (from PO), and y is inside z (from NTPP), x must share interior points with z.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible: x definitely shares some parts with z (the parts it shares with y), and x can also have parts outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible: x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible: x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible: This would make z a proper part of x, which would mean y is also a proper part of x (contradicting PO(x,y)).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible: For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible: This would mean PO(z,y), contradicting NTPP(y,z).
