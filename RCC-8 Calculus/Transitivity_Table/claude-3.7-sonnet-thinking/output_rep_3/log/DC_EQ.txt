PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Let's think about what these relations mean:
- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy the exact same space.

Since y and z occupy the exact same space (they are equal), any spatial relationship that x has with y would be exactly the same as the relationship x has with z.

Given that x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), and y is equal to z (EQ(y,z)), then x must also be disconnected from z, i.e., DC(x,z).

So the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

To verify this, let's think about if any other RCC-8 relation could hold between x and z:

- EC(x,z): Not possible because x doesn't touch y, and z is exactly the same as y.
- PO(x,z): Not possible because x doesn't share any part with y, and z is exactly the same as y.
- TPP(x,z): Not possible because x is not part of y, and z is exactly the same as y.
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible because x is not part of y, and z is exactly the same as y.
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible because y is not part of x, and z is exactly the same as y.
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible because y is not part of x, and z is exactly the same as y.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because x is disconnected from y, and y is equal to z, so x cannot be equal to z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step by step:

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same region, any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), and y is identical to z (EQ(y,z)), then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
