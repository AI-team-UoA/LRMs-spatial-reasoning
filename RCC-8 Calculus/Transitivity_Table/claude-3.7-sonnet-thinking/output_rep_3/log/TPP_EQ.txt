PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We have:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means that x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is contained within y but is not equal to y), and x touches the boundary of y.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are equal, i.e., they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Since y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), whatever relationship x has with y, x should have the same relationship with z.

Since TPP(x,y), we have that x is a tangential proper part of y. And since y and z are equal, x should also be a tangential proper part of z. So, TPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
EQ(y,z) means y and z are equal.

If y and z are equal, they have the same boundary and the same interior. Since x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary, x must also be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this a bit more. The RCC-8 relations are supposed to be mutually exhaustive, so there's only one relation that holds between any two objects.

If TPP(x,y), then x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
If EQ(y,z), then y and z are the same.

So, if y and z are the same, and x is a tangential proper part of y, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z. There's no other possible relation that could hold.

So, the answer is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be more precise. Let's explicitly check each of the RCC-8 relations to see if they can hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This can't be true because TPP(x,y) means x is a part of y, and EQ(y,z) means y and z are equal, so x must also be a part of z. Parts are not disconnected from the whole.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Again, this can't be true because TPP(x,y) means x is a part of y, so x and y share interior parts, and since y and z are equal, x and z must also share interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means x and z share some spatial parts, but neither is a part of the other. This can't be true because TPP(x,y) means x is a part of y, and since y and z are equal, x must also be a part of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given that TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z), x is contained within y and touches y's boundary, and y and z are equal, so x must also be contained within z and touch z's boundary. This relation is consistent with our premises.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This can't be true because TPP(x,y) means x touches y's boundary, and since y and z are equal, x must also touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is contained within x and touches x's boundary. This can't be true because TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, and since y and z are equal, z can't be a part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This can't be true for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This can't be true because TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, which means x is not equal to y, and since y and z are equal, x is not equal to z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let's just double check this with some examples.

Imagine:
- x is a small square
- y is a larger square that contains x, and x touches the boundary of y
- z is equal to y, i.e., z is also the larger square

In this scenario, x is a tangential proper part of both y and z, i.e., TPP(x,y) and TPP(x,z). This confirms our conclusion.

Let's try another example:
- x is a small circle
- y is a larger circle that contains x, and x touches the boundary of y
- z is equal to y, i.e., z is also the larger circle

Again, x is a tangential proper part of both y and z, i.e., TPP(x,y) and TPP(x,z). This further confirms our conclusion.

So, the answer to the question "If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship must hold between x and z given the two relationships we already know.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained within y and touches y's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since y and z are exactly the same spatial region (EQ(y,z)), any relationship that x has with y must be identical to the relationship x has with z.

If x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), and y is identical to z, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
