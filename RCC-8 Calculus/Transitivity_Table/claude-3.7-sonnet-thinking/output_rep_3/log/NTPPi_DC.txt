PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step.

We know that:
1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.
2. DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected - they don't share any parts and don't even touch.

Now, let's determine what the possible relationships between x and z could be.

Given that y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) and z is completely disconnected from y, there are several possibilities for how x and z could relate:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z could be externally connected (touching at their boundaries).
3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap.
4. TPP(z,x): z could be a tangential proper part of x.
5. NTPP(z,x): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x.
6. TPPi(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z.
7. NTPPi(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal.

Let's analyze each possibility to see if it's consistent with the given conditions:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. If y is inside x and z is outside x completely, then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. If y is inside x (not touching x's boundary) and z is outside x but touches x's boundary, then x and z are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. If y is inside x and z partially overlaps with x (but does not contain y), then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(z,x): This is possible. If y is inside x and z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary), and y and z are disconnected, then this scenario is consistent.

5. NTPP(z,x): This is possible. If y is inside x and z is also inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y and z are disconnected, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means y is inside x. If x is inside z, then y would also be inside z. But we're told that y and z are disconnected, which contradicts y being inside z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar to the above, this would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But if x is inside z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning:

For TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z), I'm saying these are not possible because they would imply that y is not disconnected from z, which contradicts the given DC(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), y is definitely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means y and z share parts, contradicting DC(y,z).

For NTPPi(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is inside x, y is also inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

For EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then they are the same region. Since y is inside x, y is also inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

Actually, upon reflection, I think there are some issues with my analysis of TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x):

For TPP(z,x): If z is a tangential proper part of x, that means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y is also inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y and z are disconnected (from DC(y,z)), then this scenario is consistent.

For NTPP(z,x): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, that means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If y is also inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y and z are disconnected (from DC(y,z)), then this scenario is consistent.

For PO(x,z): Let's imagine x and z partially overlap. This means x and z share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. Given that y is completely inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), y could be in a part of x that doesn't overlap with z. In this case, y and z would be disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

For EC(x,z): Let's imagine x and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), y wouldn't touch z. This means y and z are disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

For DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then they don't share any parts and don't touch. Given that y is inside x, y is also disconnected from z, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I realize there's an error above though: I'm mistakenly thinking of TPP(z,x) as "z is a tangential proper part of x", but what the problem statement actually defines is TPP(x,y) means "x is part of y and touches y's boundary". So TPP(z,x) would mean "z is part of x and touches x's boundary".

Actually, upon further reflection, it seems I'm correct. TPP(z,x) does mean "z is a tangential proper part of x", so z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Similarly, NTPP(z,x) means "z is a non-tangential proper part of x", so z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

So, to clarify, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

But wait, I should think this through more carefully, as there might be issues with some of these.

For the case of TPPi(x,z), I said it's not possible because if x is a tangential proper part of z, then y (which is inside x) would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). But I think I was imagining something incorrect.

I know that DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected. If TPPi(x,z) holds, then x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given NTPPi(x,y), y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, y is inside z (through x) and doesn't touch z's boundary. But this contradicts DC(y,z), which says y and z are disconnected. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually wait, I think my initial analysis was correct. 

If TPPi(x,z) holds, then x is a tangential proper part of z. Given NTPPi(x,y), y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This means y is inside z (since x is inside z) and doesn't touch z's boundary. But this contradicts DC(y,z), which says y and z are disconnected. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), similar reasoning applies. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then y (which is inside x) is also inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are equal, then y (which is inside x) is also inside z, contradicting DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Ah, I realize I wasn't careful with the definition of DC(y,z). DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected, which means they don't share any parts and don't even touch. So if y is inside z, then y and z would share parts, which contradicts DC(y,z).

Now, let's re-examine the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then y (which is inside x) is also disconnected from z. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): If x and z are externally connected (touching at their boundaries), then y (which is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary) is disconnected from z. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then y could be in a part of x that doesn't overlap with z. In this case, y and z would be disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

4. TPP(z,x): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), y and z could be disconnected within x. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(z,x): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is also inside x, y and z could be disconnected within x. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, y is also inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z), which says y and z don't share any parts. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, y is also inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z), which says y and z don't share any parts. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then y (which is inside x) is also inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z), which says y and z don't share any parts. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Oh wait, I think we need to be careful about TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x). If z is a proper part of x (whether tangential or non-tangential), then z is inside x. If y is also inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), y and z might overlap or even be connected within x, which would contradict DC(y,z).

Let me think more carefully about these cases:

For TPP(z,x): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z don't share any parts and don't touch. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x and don't touch.

Let me try to picture this: Imagine x as a big circle. Inside x, there's a smaller circle y that doesn't touch the boundary of x. Also inside x, there's another region z that touches the boundary of x. As long as y and z don't overlap or touch, we have NTPPi(x,y), TPP(z,x), and DC(y,z).

For NTPP(z,x): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. y is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), y and z don't share any parts and don't touch. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x and don't touch.

Again, picturing this: Imagine x as a big circle. Inside x, there are two smaller circles, y and z, neither of which touches the boundary of x. As long as y and z don't overlap or touch, we have NTPPi(x,y), NTPP(z,x), and DC(y,z).

Ok, I think my analysis is now correct.

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(z,x): z is a tangential proper part inverse of x (which means x is a tangential proper part of z).
- NTPPi(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part inverse of x (which means x is a non-tangential proper part of z).

Wait, I'm making an error in my notation. Let me correct:

For TPPi(z,x): This would mean z is to x as x is to y in the inverse of TPP. In other words, x is a tangential proper part of z. But if x is inside z and y is inside x, then y is inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPPi(z,x) is not possible.

For NTPPi(z,x): This would mean z is to x as x is to y in the inverse of NTPP. In other words, x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But if x is inside z and y is inside x, then y is inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPPi(z,x) is not possible.

But I think I'm making an error. Let's carefully understand the notations:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the inverse, meaning y is a tangential proper part of x. y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y. x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse, meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

So, for TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
For NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

I think I was confusing myself with the notation. Let's be clear:

TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
TPPi(z,x): z is a tangential proper part inverse of x, which means x is a tangential proper part of z. x is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's visualize the given conditions:
NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected. They don't share any parts and don't touch.

Now, let's check the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. They don't share any parts and don't touch. Given that y is inside x, if x and z are disconnected, then y and z are also disconnected. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y doesn't touch z. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. They share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. Given that y is inside x, y could be in a part of x that doesn't overlap with z. In this case, y and z would be disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, y is also inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z), which says y and z don't share any parts. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, y is also inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), y and z could be disconnected within x. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x and don't touch. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y and z could be disconnected within x. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x and don't touch. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. They are the same region. Given that y is inside x, y is also inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I've been swapping the definitions. Let me be very careful with the notations:

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y) is the inverse, meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse, meaning y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.

Now, let's check again:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. They don't share any parts and don't touch. Given that y is inside x, if x and z are disconnected, then y and z are also disconnected. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y doesn't touch z. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. They share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. Given that y is inside x, y could be in a part of x that doesn't overlap with z. In this case, y and z would be disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

4. TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, y is also inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, y is also inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y and z could be disconnected within x. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x and don't touch. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y and z could be disconnected within x. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x and don't touch. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. They are the same region. Given that y is inside x, y is also inside z. This contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Ok, I think my analysis now is correct. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Actually wait, let me really make sure I'm not messing up the meaning of TPPi and NTPPi.

From the problem statement, we have
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).

So, TPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
And NTPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Now let me see if I've been applying these definitions correctly.

For TPPi(x,z), I've been saying it means "z is part of x and touches x's boundary", which matches the definition. So, z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y and z could be disconnected within x. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x and don't touch. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), I've been saying it means "z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary", which also matches the definition. So, z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y and z could be disconnected within x. This is possible if y and z are in different parts of x and don't touch. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

I think my analysis is correct. The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Actually, let's think about EC(x,z) more carefully. If x and z are externally connected, they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), y doesn't touch z. This is consistent with DC(y,z).

But wait, I'm forgetting something. DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. They don't share any parts and don't touch. If x and z are externally connected (touch at their boundaries), and y is inside x, would y and z be disconnected?

If x and z touch at their boundaries, then the boundaries of x and z share points. But y, being a non-tangential proper part of x, doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, y doesn't touch the boundary of z. Hence, y and z don't share any points, which means they are disconnected. So, EC(x,z) is consistent with DC(y,z).

Alright, the final list of possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Actually, let me just double check the case of PO(x,z). If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points. Given that y is inside x, what's the relationship between y and z?

If y is in the part of x that overlaps with z, then y and z would share points, contradicting DC(y,z). But if y is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with z, then y and z would be disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z). So, PO(x,z) is possible as long as y is in the non-overlapping part of x.

Let's just make sure that's possible. If x and z partially overlap, there's a part of x that's not in z. Given that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, y can be located in this non-overlapping part of x, making y and z disconnected. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

So, the final list of possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

Let me work through this step by step.

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (share no parts and don't touch)

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I'll check each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If x and z are completely disconnected, then y (which is inside x) would definitely be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x and z touch only at their boundaries, y would still be disconnected from z since y doesn't touch x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x and z partially overlap, y can be in the portion of x that doesn't overlap with z, maintaining DC(y,z).

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is inside z (touching z's boundary), then y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x is completely inside z, then y would also be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, then z and y can be separate regions within x, maintaining DC(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), then z and y can be separate regions within x, maintaining DC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be inside z, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
