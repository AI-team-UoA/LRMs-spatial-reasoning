PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully analyze the scenario. We know that:
1. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are equal/coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Given these, we need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationship(s) between x and z.

Since y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), they have the exact same spatial properties. This means any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

So, if EC(x,y), and y and z are equal, then x and z must also be externally connected.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Let me double-check this. 

If EQ(y,z), then y and z are the same spatial region. If x is externally connected to y, then it must also be externally connected to z since y and z are the same region. 

The answer is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this question, I need to determine what relationship x has with z given that EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since y and z occupy exactly the same spatial region (they are equal), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if x is externally connected to y, and y is exactly the same region as z, then x must also be externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
