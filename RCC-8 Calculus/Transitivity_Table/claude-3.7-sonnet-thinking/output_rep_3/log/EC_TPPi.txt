PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break this down. We have:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. TPPi(y,z): This is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given these constraints.

First, let's understand what TPPi(y,z) or equivalently TPP(z,y) means geometrically. z is properly inside y (z is a part of y) and z touches the boundary of y. 

Now, we know EC(x,y), so x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap in their interiors.

Let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible if z is inside y but doesn't extend to the boundary where x and y touch.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   This is possible if z extends to the exact part of y's boundary where x and y touch.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   I'm trying to see if this is possible. If z is a part of y and touches y's boundary, and x touches y's boundary from the outside, could x and z partially overlap? I don't think so because we know that x and y are EC, which means x is outside y except for the boundary. Since z is inside y, it can't overlap with x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
   For this to be true, x would have to be inside z, which is inside y, but x is outside y except for the boundary, so this isn't possible.

5. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
   For this to be true, z would have to be inside x, but z is inside y, and x is outside y except for the boundary. This isn't possible.

6. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   For similar reasons as above, this isn't possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   Again, this isn't possible because z is inside y and x is outside y except for the boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   This would mean x and z are the same, but we know x is outside y (except for the boundary) and z is inside y, so they can't be the same.

So, it seems only DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are possible.

Actually, let me think more carefully. 

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's think geometrically. x is outside of y, and they only touch at a boundary point. z is inside y, and z also touches y's boundary.

The question is: what relationship can x and z have?

If x and y touch at a boundary point, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary, there are two possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. z doesn't touch the boundary of y at the same place where x touches y. In this case, x and z are disconnected, so we have DC(x,z).

2. z touches the boundary of y at the same place where x touches y. In this case, x and z touch at a boundary, so we have EC(x,z).

Let me think about whether there's any other possibility. Could z overlap with x? Given that x is outside y except for the boundary, and z is inside y, it doesn't seem possible for them to overlap. 

Actually, wait. I need to think more carefully about TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y). This means z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

Since EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary point, and since TPP(z,y), z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

There are two possibilities:

1. z touches y's boundary at a point different from where x touches y. In this case, x and z would be disconnected, giving DC(x,z).

2. z touches y's boundary at the same point where x touches y. In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary, giving EC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Let me double check.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.

So, y contains z, and z touches the boundary of y. x is outside of y, and x touches the boundary of y.

Let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This happens if z doesn't touch the boundary of y at the same point where x touches it.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary. This happens if z touches the boundary of y at the same point where x touches it.

Could x and z partially overlap? If z is contained within y, and x is outside of y except for touching at the boundary, then it doesn't seem possible for x and z to share any interior points. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

Could z be a proper part of x, or could x be a proper part of z? If z is contained within y, and x is outside of y except for touching at the boundary, then neither of these scenarios is possible. So, TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

Could x and z be equal? If z is contained within y, and x is outside of y except for touching at the boundary, then x and z cannot be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given the constraints EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's analyze what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- TPPi(y,z): This is the same as TPP(z,y), meaning z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary

Given these constraints:

1. DC(x,z) is possible if z touches y's boundary at a different location than where x touches y. In this case, x and z would have no connection.

2. EC(x,z) is possible if z touches y's boundary exactly at the same location where x touches y. In this case, x and z would touch at their boundaries.

No other RCC-8 relation is possible because:
- z is inside y, while x is outside y (except at their boundary)
- This prevents any overlap between x and z (ruling out PO)
- Neither can be part of the other (ruling out TPP, TPPi, NTPP, NTPPi)
- They cannot be equal (ruling out EQ)
