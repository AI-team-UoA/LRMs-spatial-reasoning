PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and y does not touch the boundary of x. In other words, y is completely contained within the interior of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and z does not touch the boundary of y. In other words, z is completely contained within the interior of y.

Now, we need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given these constraints.

First, let's think about what these relations tell us about the spatial relationship between x, y, and z:
- y is completely contained within the interior of x
- z is completely contained within the interior of y

From these, we can deduce that z is also contained within the interior of x, because z is contained within y, which is contained within the interior of x. 

So, z is definitely a proper part of x. Now, we need to determine whether z touches the boundary of x or not.

Since z is completely contained within the interior of y, and y is completely contained within the interior of x, z cannot touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. The relation NTPPi(x,z) means that z is completely contained within the interior of x, which is true in this case. So the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I made a mistake. Let me be more careful. 

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper non-tangential part of x. In other words, x properly contains y, and y does not touch the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper non-tangential part of y. In other words, y properly contains z, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Given these two relations, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

We know that y is properly contained within x, and z is properly contained within y. This means that z is also properly contained within x (by transitivity of containment). So, z is definitely a proper part of x.

Now, we need to determine whether z touches the boundary of x or not. Since z is completely contained within y, and y does not touch the boundary of x, it follows that z also does not touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm mixing up NTPP and NTPPi. Let me be more precise.

NTPP(a,b) means that a is a non-tangential proper part of b.
NTPPi(a,b) means that b is a non-tangential proper part of a, which is equivalent to NTPP(b,a).

Given NTPPi(x,y), we have NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
Given NTPPi(y,z), we have NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, by transitivity of NTPP, if NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(z,y), then NTPP(z,x). This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Converting back to NTPPi, we have NTPPi(x,z) as the relation between x and z.

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I should be more careful and consider whether there are other possible relationships between x and z.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper non-tangential part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper non-tangential part of y.

From these, we know that:
- y is properly contained within the interior of x
- z is properly contained within the interior of y

Since z is properly contained within y, and y is properly contained within x, it follows that z is properly contained within x. Moreover, since z is within the interior of y and y is within the interior of x, z is within the interior of x. Thus, z does not touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, denoted as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to analyze this a bit more carefully. Let me visualize this scenario more explicitly.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Visually, y is a region completely contained within the interior of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Visually, z is a region completely contained within the interior of y.

Given these relations, z is contained within y, and y is contained within x. So, z is definitely contained within x. Since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, it's clear that z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x). Equivalently, we can say NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realized that I should revisit this one more time to be absolutely sure.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is properly contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given these, let's determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

I need to be more careful here. Let me analyze the possible relations one by one:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we know z is contained within y, and y is contained within x. So, z is contained within x, which means they are connected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. However, we know z is completely contained within y, and y is completely contained within x. So, z is also completely contained within x. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. But we know z is completely contained within y, and y is completely contained within x. So, z is completely contained within x, not just partially. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(z,x): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. But for z to be tangential to x, it would need to touch the boundary of x. However, z is contained within y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, z doesn't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, TPP(z,x) is not possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that z is contained within y, which is contained within x, and neither z touches the boundary of y nor y touches the boundary of x, z is indeed a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. But we know y is contained within x, and z is contained within y. So, x contains z, not the other way around. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But as we established, x contains z, not the other way around. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. But we know z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. This means z is also a proper part of x, not equal to x. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, from the eight RCC-8 relations, only NTPP(z,x) is possible given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). Equivalently, we can say NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is: NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I need to be a bit more careful. I'm trying to understand the relationship between x and z, not z and x.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y

We want to determine the relationship between x and z.

From NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is properly contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
From NTPPi(y,z), we know that z is properly contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given these, z is properly contained within y, which is properly contained within x. So, z is properly contained within x. Moreover, z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x).

Now, if we're looking for the relationship from x to z (rather than from z to x), it would be the inverse of NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let me check all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z in both directions:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But we've established that z is contained within x. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But we've established that z is completely contained within the interior of x. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. But we've established that z is completely contained within x. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. But we've established that z is contained within x. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But we've established that z is contained within x. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. But we've established that z is non-tangentially contained within x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with our deduction. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. But we've established that z is a proper part of x. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

But I need to double-check this. 

NTPP(a,b) means that a is a non-tangential proper part of b. That is, a is a proper part of b and does not touch the boundary of b.

NTPPi(a,b) means that b is a non-tangential proper part of a. That is, b is a proper part of a and does not touch the boundary of a.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

We want to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

So far, I've established that z is a proper part of x (since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x). Additionally, z doesn't touch the boundary of x (since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x).

So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x) in RCC-8. From the perspective of the relation from x to z, it's the inverse of NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So in more careful and systematic terms, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I need to be even more careful. Let me try to construct a counter-example where the relation between x and z is not NTPPi(x,z).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Visually, this means:
- x is a region containing y in its interior.
- y is a region containing z in its interior.

Now, can z have any relation with x other than being a non-tangential proper part of x?

Let's go through the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. But z is inside y, which is inside x. So, z is inside x, making DC(x,z) impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch only at their boundaries. But z is inside y, which is inside x. So, z is inside x, making EC(x,z) impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. But z is completely inside y, which is completely inside x. So, z is completely inside x, making PO(x,z) impossible.

4. TPP(z,x): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be the case, z would need to touch the boundary of x. But z is inside y, which doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, z doesn't touch the boundary of x, making TPP(z,x) impossible.

5. NTPP(z,x): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with our deduction. So, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. But z is inside y, which is inside x. So, x is larger than z, making TPPi(x,z) impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But as we've established, z is inside x. So, x is larger than z, making NTPPi(x,z) impossible.

Wait, I'm mixing up the relations. Let me be very careful here.

NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is the same as NTPP(z,x).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, or NTPP(z,y).

Now, we want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, it follows that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, NTPP(z,x).

Converting this to the inverse relation, we have NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I see the issue. I've been inconsistent with the notation.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Both of these statements are describing the relation from the perspective of the second argument to the first.

So, from NTPPi(x,y), we know y is contained within x.
From NTPPi(y,z), we know z is contained within y.

Therefore, z is contained within y, which is contained within x. So, z is contained within x. Furthermore, z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is denoted as NTPP(z,x). Alternatively, from the perspective of the relation from x to z, it's the inverse of NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I need to make a distinction here: I believe NTPP(a,b) means "a is a non-tangential proper part of b", whereas NTPPi(a,b) means the inverse, i.e., "b is a non-tangential proper part of a".

But another way to think about it is to interpret NTPPi(a,b) as "a inverse-NTPP b", which is the same as "a contains b, and b doesn't touch the boundary of a".

From NTPPi(x,y), we know x contains y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x.
From NTPPi(y,z), we know y contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Therefore, x contains z (since x contains y, which contains z). Additionally, z doesn't touch the boundary of x (since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x).

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means "x contains z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x".

Just to double-check, the correct interpretation of NTPPi:

In the RCC-8 calculus, NTPPi(a,b) is the inverse of NTPP(a,b). Specifically:
- NTPP(a,b) means "a is a non-tangential proper part of b". That is, a is inside b and doesn't touch the boundary of b.
- NTPPi(a,b) means "b is a non-tangential proper part of a". That is, b is inside a and doesn't touch the boundary of a.

Given the above interpretation:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, it follows that z is inside x. Moreover, z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, so z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Actually I just want to double-check, by writing out the inverse relations. 

NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b.
NTPP(b,a) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a.
NTPPi(a,b) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a, which is the same as NTPP(b,a).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is the same as NTPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which is the same as NTPP(z,y).

Now, we want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(z,y), we can deduce that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, NTPP(z,x). Translating this to the inverse relation, we have NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think through the logical implications one more time, but from first principles. In the RCC-8 calculus, the basic interpretation of these relations is in terms of regions in space. That is, we have spatial variables that can be interpreted as occupied regions of space, and the binary relations DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ that hold on these region variables.

Let's assume we have three regions x, y, and z, and we know:
- NTPPi(x,y) holds
- NTPPi(y,z) holds

We want to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's analyze what these given relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. In simpler terms, y is completely inside x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper subset of y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y. In simpler terms, z is completely inside y.

From these, we can deduce that z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x. By transitivity, z is completely inside x. Additionally, since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, it follows that z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is completely inside x.

Let me also check if there are any other possible relations between x and z given the information. I need to consider all 8 RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This contradicts our deduction that z is inside x. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries. This contradicts our deduction that z is completely inside x. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This contradicts our deduction that z is completely inside x. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This contradicts our deduction that z is inside x, not the other way around. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This contradicts our deduction that z is inside x, not the other way around. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But we've deduced that z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with our deduction. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This contradicts our deduction that z is a proper subset of x. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the only possible RCC-8 relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

In conclusion, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary)

From these, we can deduce:
- z is completely inside y
- y is completely inside x
- z doesn't touch y's boundary
- y doesn't touch x's boundary

Therefore, z must be completely inside x (by transitivity). Additionally, since z doesn't touch y's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary.

This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which in RCC-8 is represented as NTPPi(x,z).

Let me verify by checking other possible relations:
- DC, EC, PO: Impossible because z is contained within x
- TPP, NTPP: Impossible because x contains z, not vice versa
- TPPi: Impossible because z doesn't touch x's boundary
- EQ: Impossible because z is properly contained in x

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
