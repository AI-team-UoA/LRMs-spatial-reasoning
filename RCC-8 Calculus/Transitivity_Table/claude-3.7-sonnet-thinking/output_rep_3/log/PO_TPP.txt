PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We're given:
1. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap, meaning they share some parts but neither is part of the other.
2. TPP(y,z) - y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

We need to find all possible relations between x and z from the RCC-8 calculus: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Since PO(x,y), x and y share some parts, but x extends beyond y in some areas, and y extends beyond x in others.
Since TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - This means x and z are disconnected. 
   Is this possible? Since y is part of z and x overlaps with y, at least part of x must overlap with z. So x and z cannot be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interiors.
   Is this possible? Given that PO(x,y), x shares interior points with y. And since TPP(y,z), y is inside z. So, some part of x must be inside z, meaning they share interior points. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me reconsider. 

PO(x,y) means x and y share some parts, but x has parts outside of y, and y has parts outside of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

So, x shares some parts with y, which is inside z. This means x and z must share some parts. But x also has parts outside of y. These parts of x could potentially be outside of z, or they could still be inside z.

So, the possible relations are:

3. PO(x,z) - This means x and z share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.
   Is this possible? Yes, if parts of x that are outside of y are also outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z) - This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
   Is this possible? Yes, if all parts of x (including those outside of y) are inside z, and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary.
   Is this possible? Yes, if all parts of x (including those outside of y) are inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
   Is this possible? No, because y is inside z, and x overlaps with y. Since parts of y are inside z, and parts of x are inside y, not all of z can be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary.
   Is this possible? No, for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - This means x and z are the same region.
   Is this possible? No, because y is a tangential proper part of z, but PO(x,y). If x = z, then TPP(y,x), which contradicts PO(x,y).

Actually, let me revisit TPPi and NTPPi. 

For TPPi(x,z), this would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But given TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. This would mean y is a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), this would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, given TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z, so y would be a proper part of x, contradicting PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I need to be more careful in my analysis. Let me try to reason about this more systematically.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some spatial parts, but neither is a part of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's think about what PO(x,y) implies:
1. x and y have a shared region.
2. x has parts outside of y.
3. y has parts outside of x.

Now, TPP(y,z) means:
1. y is completely inside z.
2. y touches z's boundary.

From these, we can deduce:
- Since x and y share a region, and y is inside z, x and z must also share a region (they can't be DC or EC).
- The parts of x that are outside of y could be inside or outside of z.
- Since y has parts outside of x, and y is inside z, there are parts of z that are outside of x.

Given these deductions, let's check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as we've established x and z share a region.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible, as x and z share interior points through y.
3. PO(x,z): This is possible if parts of x that are outside of y are also outside of z. So, x and z share a region (through y), x has parts outside of z, and z has parts outside of x.
4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if all parts of x (including those outside of y) are inside z, and x touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if all parts of x (including those outside of y) are inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is a proper part of x, then y, being a proper part of z, would also be a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y).
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are the same, then y would be a proper part of x, contradicting PO(x,y).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning about TPPi and NTPPi.

For TPPi(x,z), we'd have z as a proper part of x, and z touches x's boundary. Given TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. This would mean y is a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a proper part of x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, given TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. This would mean y is a proper part of x, contradicting PO(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning about EQ.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. Given TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. If x and z are the same, then y would be a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me check one more time to make sure.

If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. PO(x,z): x and z share a region, but neither is a part of the other.
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary.

The relations DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are not possible given the constraints.

Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Since PO(x,y), there are parts of x that don't overlap with y. Could these parts of x not overlap with z, making DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) possible?

No, since PO(x,y), x and y share interior points. Since TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z. This means x and z share interior points (through y), making DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) impossible.

Could all of z be inside x, making TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) possible?

No, since TPP(y,z), y is inside z. But given PO(x,y), y is not entirely inside x (y has parts outside of x). So, z has parts outside of x, making TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) impossible.

Could x and z be equal, making EQ(x,z) possible?

No, since TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. If x = z, then y would be a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

I am confident that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me reconsider once more to be 100% sure.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some parts, but neither is a part of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary).

Let's consider a scenario where y is a tangential proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y.

Since PO(x,y), parts of x overlap with y, but x also has parts outside of y, and y has parts outside of x.

Since TPP(y,z), all of y is inside z, and y touches z's boundary.

Now, for the part of x that overlaps with y, since y is inside z, this part of x is also inside z. For the part of x that's outside of y, it could be inside z or outside z.

If all of x, including the parts outside of y, is inside z, and x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z).
If all of x, including the parts outside of y, is inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).
If parts of x that are outside of y are also outside of z, then PO(x,z).

But could x be completely outside of z? No, because x shares parts with y, and y is inside z. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Could z be inside x? No, because y is inside z, and y is not completely inside x (due to PO(x,y)). This rules out TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Could x and z be the same? No, because y is a proper part of z, but y is not a proper part of x (due to PO(x,y)). This rules out EQ(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I'm confident now. These are the only three possibilities.

Actually, I'm going to double-check once more.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y overlap, but neither is contained in the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. Since PO(x,y) and y is inside z, x and z share some parts. So, DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch but don't share interior points. Since PO(x,y) and y is inside z, x and z share interior points. So, EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x has parts outside of z. Given PO(x,y), x has parts outside of y. If these parts of x are outside of z, then PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. Since TPP(y,z), y touches z's boundary. If x also touches z's boundary and is entirely inside z, then TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary. If the parts of x that are outside of y are still inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Since TPP(y,z), y is inside z. Given PO(x,y), y is not entirely inside x. This means z is not entirely inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For the same reason as TPPi, this is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. Since TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z. If x = z, then y would be a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Based on the analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I might need to revise my understanding. Let me ensure I have the right understanding of PO(x,y).

PO(x,y) means x and y overlap, but neither is a part of the other. This means:
- Some points are in both x and y.
- Some points are in x but not in y.
- Some points are in y but not in x.

Given this, and TPP(y,z), which means y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary), the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, x and z must also overlap.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Given PO(x,y), x and y share interior points. Since y is inside z, x and z must also share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. Some points of x are inside z (through y), and some points of x might be outside of z. Definitely, there are points of z that are not in x (since y is a proper part of z, and there are points of y that are not in x).

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. If all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. If all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is a proper part of x, then all points of z are in x. But since TPP(y,z), all points of y are in z. This would mean all points of y are in x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible, for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x = z, then since TPP(y,z), y would be a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I am very confident in this answer. I have checked it multiple times, and it makes logical sense.

To summarize:
If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the implications of the given relations and determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some parts, but neither is contained in the other)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible. Since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, x must share at least some points with z.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible. The parts of x that overlap with y must share interior points with z, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. Some parts of x overlap with y (and therefore z), while other parts of x could extend outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. All of x could be inside z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. All of x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible. This would mean z is inside x, but since y is inside z and y has parts outside x (from PO(x,y)), z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. If x equals z, then y would be a proper part of x, contradicting PO(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
