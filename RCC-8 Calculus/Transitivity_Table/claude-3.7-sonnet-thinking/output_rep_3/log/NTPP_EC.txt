PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between regions x and z given that NTPP(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze the given information:

1. NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary. x is completely contained within the interior of y.

2. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior points.

Now I need to figure out what this means for the relationship between x and z.

Since x is completely in the interior of y (NTPP(x,y)), and y only touches z at the boundary (EC(y,z)), then x cannot share any points with z. This is because:
- x is strictly in the interior of y
- z only touches y at the boundary
- x does not touch y's boundary (by definition of NTPP)

Therefore, x and z must be disconnected, which corresponds to the DC(x,z) relation.

To be completely sure, let me verify that no other relation is possible:

- EC(x,z): Not possible because x would need to touch z's boundary, but x is strictly in the interior of y and doesn't reach y's boundary.
- PO(x,z): Not possible because x and z would need to overlap, but z only touches y at the boundary.
- TPP(x,z): Not possible because x would need to be part of z, but z and y only share boundary points.
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible because x would need to be completely within z, but z and y only share boundary points.
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible because z would need to be a tangential proper part of x, but x is completely within y.
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible because z would need to be completely within x, but x is completely within y.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because x and z would need to be identical, but x is completely within y and z is outside y except at the boundary.

So the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning. 

If NTPP(x,y), then x is completely in the interior of y. If EC(y,z), then y and z touch only at their boundaries.

Since x is completely in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot have any points in common. Therefore, they must be disconnected.

So my answer is that the possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship can exist between x and z given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points

Given that:
1. x is completely contained within the interior of y (not touching y's boundary)
2. z only touches y at the boundary (not sharing interior points)

Since x is strictly in y's interior and z only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot share any points or even touch. There must be some portion of y separating them.

Therefore, x and z must be disconnected.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
