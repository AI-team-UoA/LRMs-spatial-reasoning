PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's figure out what NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) tell us, and then reason about the possible relationships between x and z.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. So y is entirely contained within the interior of x.

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is contained within the other.

Now, let's think about what these two relationships imply for the relationship between x and z.

Since y is entirely contained within the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)), and y partially overlaps with z (from PO(y,z)), we know that z must at least partially overlap with x. This is because the common part shared by y and z must be contained within x.

But beyond this partial overlap, what other relationships are possible between x and z?

1. Can x and z be disconnected (DC)? No, because we've established that they must at least partially overlap due to the common part shared by y and z.

2. Can x and z be externally connected (EC)? No, for the same reason. They must at least partially overlap.

3. Can x and z partially overlap (PO)? Yes, this is definitely a possibility. x contains y entirely, y partially overlaps with z, so x and z can partially overlap.

4. Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))? I don't think so. Since y is entirely contained within x, and y partially overlaps with z, it doesn't seem possible for x to be entirely contained within z. If x were entirely contained within z, then y would also be entirely contained within z, which contradicts PO(y,z).

5. Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))? No, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z))? Yes, this is possible. If z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary, this is consistent with y being entirely contained within the interior of x and y partially overlapping with z.

7. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z))? Yes, this is also possible. If z is entirely contained within the interior of x, this is consistent with y being entirely contained within the interior of x and y partially overlapping with z.

8. Can x and z be equal (EQ(x,z))? No, because if x and z were equal, then y would be entirely contained within z, which contradicts PO(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Wait, I'm not sure my logic is entirely correct. Let me double-check by drawing out some examples.

For NTPPi(x,y), y is fully contained within the interior of x.
For PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap.

Let's consider the different possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since y is contained within x and y overlaps with z, there must be some common area between x and z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. Again, since y is contained within the interior of x and y overlaps with z, there must be common interior points between x and z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither is contained within the other. This is definitely possible. y is within the interior of x, and y overlaps with z, so x and z can partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? If x is contained within z, then y (which is contained within x) would also be contained within z. But PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with neither being fully contained within the other. This seems inconsistent, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. For the same reason as TPP(x,z), this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. y is contained within the interior of x, and y overlaps with z, so z can be contained within x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. This is also possible. y is contained within the interior of x, and y overlaps with z, so z can be contained within the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then y would be contained within z's interior (since it's contained within x's interior). But PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap, with neither being fully contained within the other. This is inconsistent, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Actually, hmm, I'm not sure if TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are really impossible. Let's think about this more carefully.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is fully contained within the interior of x. PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. Can this be consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z)? If x is contained within z, then y (which is contained within x) would also be contained within z. But PO(y,z) means y and z share some common part, but neither is fully contained within the other.

Actually, I see my mistake. The definition of PO(y,z) doesn't imply that y is not fully contained within z. It just means they share some part, and neither is part of the other. So if y is fully contained within z, then PO(y,z) would not hold.

So my conclusion stands: TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

Actually, I still feel I might be missing something. Let me reconsider the definition of PO and think about this more clearly.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is fully contained within the other. So it's not the case that y is part of z, and it's not the case that z is part of y.

Now, NTPPi(x,y) means y is fully contained within the interior of x.

If TPP(x,z) were to hold, x would be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. Since y is contained within x, y would also be contained within z. But PO(y,z) means y is not fully contained within z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

What about DC(x,z)? This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since y is contained within x and y overlaps with z, there must be some common area between x and z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

What about EC(x,z)? This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. Again, since y is contained within the interior of x and y overlaps with z, there must be common interior points between x and z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

What about EQ(x,z)? This would mean x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then y would be contained within z's interior (since it's contained within x's interior). But PO(y,z) means y is not fully contained within z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Actually, hmm, I just realized I should really go back to the definitions of all of these relations, as there seems to be some ambiguity in how I'm interpreting them.

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They share no points.
EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected. They touch at a boundary but share no interior points.
PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is fully contained within the other.
TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. x is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. x is fully contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. y is fully contained within x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. y is fully contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
EQ(x,y): x and y are equal. They occupy the same space.

Given these definitions, let's reconsider the problem.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is fully contained within the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is fully contained within the other.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since y is contained within x and y overlaps with z, there must be some common area between x and z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. Again, since y is contained within the interior of x and y overlaps with z, there must be common interior points between x and z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points, but neither is fully contained within the other. This is possible. y is within the interior of x, and y overlaps with z, so x and z can partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? If x is contained within z, then y (which is contained within x) would also be contained within z. But PO(y,z) means neither y nor z is fully contained within the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. For the same reason as TPP(x,z), this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. y is contained within the interior of x, and y overlaps with z, so z can be contained within x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. This is also possible. y is contained within the interior of x, and y overlaps with z, so z can be contained within the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then y would be contained within z's interior (since it's contained within x's interior). But PO(y,z) means neither y nor z is fully contained within the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Let's create some examples to test this conclusion.

Example 1: x is a big circle, y is a small circle fully inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a circle that partially overlaps with y (with parts inside and outside of x). Here, NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Example 2: x is a big circle, y is a small circle fully inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a circle fully inside x that touches x's boundary and overlaps with y. Here, NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Example 3: x is a big circle, y is a small circle fully inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a small circle fully inside x (not touching x's boundary) that overlaps with y. Here, NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

These examples confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Actually, I want to make sure I'm thinking of PO correctly.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is fully contained within the other.

One clarification: When we say "neither is fully contained within the other", we mean that y is not a subset of z, and z is not a subset of y. It's not about spatial containment in the sense of one region being inside another.

So for PO(y,z), y and z share some region, but there's also a part of y that's not in z, and a part of z that's not in y.

With this clarification, let's double-check our previous examples:

Example 1: x is a big circle, y is a small circle fully inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a circle that partially overlaps with y (with parts inside and outside of x). Here, NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Example 2: x is a big circle, y is a small circle fully inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a circle fully inside x that touches x's boundary and overlaps with y. Here, NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Example 3: x is a big circle, y is a small circle fully inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a small circle fully inside x (not touching x's boundary) that overlaps with y. Here, NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

All of these examples still work with our refined understanding of PO. So our conclusion remains the same: the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Actually, I think there's one more relationship I need to consider: DC(x,z). 

Oh wait, no, DC(x,z) is not possible. Since y is contained within the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y)), and y shares some common part with z (from PO(y,z)), there must be some common part between x and z. So x and z cannot be disconnected.

So, after careful consideration, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Ah, now I'm second-guessing myself. Let's double-check once again.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is fully contained within the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some interior points, but neither is fully contained within the other.

Could DC(x,z) be possible? No, because y is contained within x and overlaps with z, so x and z must share some points.

Could EC(x,z) be possible? No, because y is contained within the interior of x and overlaps with z, so x and z must share some interior points, not just boundary points.

Could PO(x,z) be possible? Yes, if z extends beyond the boundary of x, but also has parts inside x that overlap with y.

Could TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) be possible? No, because if x is fully contained within z, then y (which is contained within x) would also be fully contained within z. But PO(y,z) means y is not fully contained within z.

Could TPPi(x,z) be possible? Yes, if z is fully contained within x and touches x's boundary, and also overlaps with y.

Could NTPPi(x,z) be possible? Yes, if z is fully contained within the interior of x and overlaps with y.

Could EQ(x,z) be possible? No, because if x and z are the same, then y (which is contained within x) would be contained within z. But PO(y,z) means y is not fully contained within z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Alright, I think my analysis is correct. The possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realized that I've been making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me be precise about what PO(y,z) means:

PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is a part of the other. So it's not the case that y is part of z (i.e., y is not fully contained within z), and it's not the case that z is part of y (i.e., z is not fully contained within y).

With this understanding, let's reconsider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since y is contained within x and y overlaps with z, there must be some common area between x and z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. Again, since y is contained within the interior of x and y overlaps with z, there must be common interior points between x and z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some common part, but neither is a part of the other. This is possible. y is within the interior of x, and y overlaps with z, so x and z can partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? If x is fully contained within z, then y (which is fully contained within x) would also be fully contained within z. But PO(y,z) means y is not fully contained within z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. For the same reason as TPP(x,z), this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. y is contained within the interior of x, and y overlaps with z, so z can be fully contained within x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. This is also possible. y is contained within the interior of x, and y overlaps with z, so z can be fully contained within the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then y (which is fully contained within x) would be fully contained within z. But PO(y,z) means y is not fully contained within z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x

So, my answer is consistent: The possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let's understand what these relations tell us:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely within the interior of x (not touching x's boundary)
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (they share some part, but neither is contained in the other)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside x and overlaps with z, x and z must share some region.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is in the interior of x and overlaps with z, x and z must share interior points, not just boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with z extending beyond x's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were contained in z, then y would be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary while overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x (not touching x's boundary) while overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, y would be completely inside z, contradicting PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
