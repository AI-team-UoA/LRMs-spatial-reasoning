PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step-by-step:

1) We're told that NTPPi(x,y), which means that NTPP(y,x). This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.

2) We're also told that EQ(y,z), which means that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).

3) Now, we need to determine what relationship(s) could hold between x and z.

Since y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), they are essentially the same region. This means that whatever relationship y has with x, z must have the same relationship with x.

We know that NTPP(y,x), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Since z is coincident with y, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I should double-check this logic. 

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x)
- EQ(y,z), which means y and z are coincident

Since y and z are coincident, they have the same spatial extent. Therefore, the relationship between z and x must be the same as the relationship between y and x.

Since NTPP(y,x), we have NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me make sure my logic is correct by considering the definitions of these relations more carefully:

- NTPP(y,x) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, occupying exactly the same space.

Given these, if y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary, and z occupies exactly the same space as y, then z must also be completely inside x and not touching x's boundary. 

This confirms that NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z based on the given information.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since y and z are coincident (they are exactly the same region), and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, NTPP(z,x) must hold, which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
