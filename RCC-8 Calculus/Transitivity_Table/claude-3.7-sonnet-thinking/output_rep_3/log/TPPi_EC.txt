PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step-by-step.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): This means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Now, I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Since y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y at its boundary, we need to consider several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. x and z could be disconnected (DC): This would be impossible because if y touches both x's boundary and z, then x and z cannot be completely disconnected.

2. x and z could be externally connected (EC): This is possible. If y touches x's boundary at a certain point, and z also touches y at the same point but doesn't penetrate into x, then x and z would be externally connected.

3. x and z could partially overlap (PO): This is possible. If z extends beyond the boundary of x in some areas, but also penetrates into x in other areas (while still touching y), then x and z would partially overlap.

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP): This seems unlikely. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z only touches y at its boundary, it's hard to see how x could be entirely inside z.

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP): This is even less likely for the same reason as above.

6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi): This is possible. If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary (potentially through y), then TPPi(x,z) would hold.

7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi): This is possible. If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) would hold.

8. x and z could be equal (EQ): This seems unlikely. If y is a proper part of x and y touches z externally, it's hard to see how x and z could be the same region.

Let me double-check these by considering the specific scenarios:

For EC(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.
- If z touches y only at the point where y touches x's boundary, then x and z would touch at that point, making them externally connected.

For PO(x,z):
- If z extends into x (through its connection with y) but also extends outside of x, then x and z would partially overlap.

For TPPi(x,z):
- If z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary (through its connection with y), then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- If z is entirely contained within x but doesn't touch x's boundary, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

For DC(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z):
- These don't seem immediately possible given the constraints. Let's verify:

For DC(x,z):
- If y touches both x's boundary and z, then x and z must share at least that boundary point, so they can't be disconnected.

For TPP(x,z):
- If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z only touches y at y's boundary, it's hard to see how x could be entirely inside z and also touch z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z):
- Even less likely than TPP for the same reason.

For EQ(x,z):
- If y is a proper part of x and y touches z externally, then x and z cannot be the same region.

Let's think through this more systematically.

TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary. 
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

Let's denote the boundary of a region as bd(region) and the interior as int(region).

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x
- bd(y) ∩ bd(x) ≠ ∅

EC(y,z) means:
- int(y) ∩ int(z) = ∅
- bd(y) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any points. But we know that there's at least one point p ∈ bd(y) ∩ bd(z), and if p ∈ bd(x), then p ∈ bd(x) ∩ bd(z), which means x and z aren't disconnected. If p is not in bd(x), then p ∈ int(x), which means z penetrates into x, so they're still not disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z share boundary points but no interior points. If y touches x's boundary at a point p, and z touches y at the same point, then x and z would touch at that point, making them externally connected. EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other. If z extends beyond the boundary of x in some areas, but also penetrates into x in other areas (while still touching y), then x and z would partially overlap. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z only touches y at its boundary, it's challenging to see how x could be entirely inside z. TPP(x,z) seems unlikely. Wait, let me think more about this. If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, and y is inside x and touches x's boundary at the same point where x touches z's boundary, then y would touch z's boundary too. This doesn't contradict EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) could be possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given the constraints, this doesn't seem possible because if y touches x's boundary, and y touches z, then x and z must have some boundary interaction. NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary (possibly through its connection with y), then TPPi(x,z) would hold. TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) would hold. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. Given that y is a proper part of x and y touches z externally, x and z cannot be the same region. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful here. I realize I need to reconsider TPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
- TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then every part of x is a part of z. Since y is a part of x, y is also a part of z. But EC(y,z) means y and z touch only at their boundaries and don't share interior points. This contradicts the statement that y is a part of z. Hence, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me recheck my reasoning for NTPP(x,z):

For NTPP(x,z):
- NTPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

If x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then every part of x is a part of z. Since y is a part of x, y is also a part of z. But EC(y,z) means y and z touch only at their boundaries and don't share interior points. This contradicts the statement that y is a part of z. Hence, NTPP(x,z) is also not possible.

I think I'm being more clear now.

Let's recheck my conclusions for each relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as explained earlier.
2. EC(x,z): Possible, as explained earlier.
3. PO(x,z): Possible, as explained earlier.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible, as just elaborated.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible, as just elaborated.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible, as explained earlier.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible, as explained earlier.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible, as explained earlier.

Actually, I realized I've been a bit sloppy in my reasoning. Let me clarify a few things.

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x.
- bd(y) ∩ bd(x) ≠ ∅.
- y is inside x.

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries: bd(y) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅.
- y and z don't overlap: int(y) ∩ int(z) = ∅.

With these clarifications, let's analyze:

1. DC(x,z): If y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, then there's a point p in bd(y) that's also in bd(x) and bd(z). This would mean x and z share the point p, so they're not disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, this is where I went wrong. Even if y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, it's not guaranteed that there's a common point where y touches both. So, let me reconsider this.

Let's denote the region where y touches x's boundary as R_xy, and the region where y touches z's boundary as R_yz. If R_xy and R_yz don't overlap, then there's no direct path from x to z, and they could be disconnected. But if R_xy and R_yz do overlap, then there's a common point where y touches both x and z, meaning x and z are externally connected.

Actually, hold on. If TPPi(x, y), then y is inside x, meaning there's a region of y that touches the boundary of x. If EC(y, z), then there's a region of y that touches the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of x, it's entirely contained within x. If z touches y, and y is entirely within x, then z must at least touch x at the point where it touches y. So, DC(x, z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): Given that y touches x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, if z only touches the part of y that also touches x's boundary, then x and z would touch at that boundary, making them externally connected. EC(x,z) is definitely possible.

3. PO(x,z): I think I was overly generous here. If TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x, and EC(y,z) means y and z touch only at their boundaries, then the only part of z that interacts with x is through its touch with y. Since y is entirely inside x, the only interaction z has with x is at x's boundary, not its interior. So, PO(x,z) is actually not possible.

Wait, I'm thinking of an example: imagine a balloon (x) with a small balloon (y) inside touching the boundary of the outer balloon. Now, imagine a pin (z) that penetrates the outer balloon, touches the inner balloon, and then penetrates further into the outer balloon. In this case, z would overlap with x (making PO(x,z)), while still maintaining EC(y,z) and TPPi(x,y). So PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

Another example would be to look at a car inside a garage. If the garage (x) has the car (y) parked inside, touching the wall of the garage, and there's a bicycle (z) partially inside the garage but also touching the car, then PO(x,z) would hold. So PO(x,z) is still possible.

4. TPP(x,z): I think my original reasoning was a bit off. If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then every part of x, including y, is inside z. But EC(y,z) says y and z touch only at their boundaries, not that y is inside z. This creates a contradiction. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, if x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then every part of x, including y, is inside z. But EC(y,z) says y and z touch only at their boundaries, which is a contradiction. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, then z is entirely inside x. Given that y is also inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y, it's possible for z to be inside x and touch x's boundary (through the point where y also touches x's boundary). TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z is entirely inside x but not touching its boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y, it's possible for z to be inside x and not touch x's boundary (if it touches y at a point that's not where y touches x's boundary). NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, then y, being a proper part of x, is also a proper part of z. But EC(y,z) says y and z touch only at their boundaries, which contradicts y being a part of z. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me review once more:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible.
2. EC(x,z): Possible.
3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible.

Actually, I'm concerned that I'm making errors in my reasoning. Let me approach this differently and imagine a physical example.

TPPi(x,y): Imagine a donut (x) with a small ball (y) embedded within it, touching the outer edge of the donut.
EC(y,z): Now, imagine a stick (z) that touches the small ball (y) only at one point, but doesn't penetrate it.

With this setup, let's see what the relationship between the donut (x) and the stick (z) could be:

1. DC(x,z): If the stick (z) only touches the small ball (y) at a point where the ball doesn't touch the donut's boundary, then the stick might not touch the donut at all. This seems like it could be possible.

Wait, I need to reconsider. The small ball (y) is embedded in the donut (x), touching its boundary. If the stick (z) touches the ball, and the ball is inside the donut, then the stick must at least touch the donut. So, DC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If the stick (z) touches the small ball (y) at the point where the ball touches the donut's boundary, then the stick would also touch the donut's boundary. EC(x,z) is definitely possible.

3. PO(x,z): Imagine the stick (z) touches the small ball (y), but then penetrates further into the donut (x). In this case, the stick and the donut would partially overlap. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean the donut (x) is entirely inside the stick (z) but touches its boundary. Given the constraints, this doesn't seem feasible. TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean the donut (x) is entirely inside the stick (z) and doesn't touch its boundary. Again, given the constraints, this is not feasible. NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean the stick (z) is entirely inside the donut (x) and touches its boundary. If the stick is inside the donut and touches the small ball (y) at the point where the ball touches the donut's boundary, then the stick would also touch the donut's boundary. TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean the stick (z) is entirely inside the donut (x) and doesn't touch its boundary. If the stick is inside the donut and touches the small ball (y) at a point that's not where the ball touches the donut's boundary, then the stick would be inside the donut without touching its boundary. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean the donut (x) and the stick (z) are the same. Given the constraints, this is not feasible. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, to recap my physical reasoning:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible.
2. EC(x,z): Possible.
3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible.

I'd like to double-check my reasoning for DC(x,z) once more. Hmm, maybe I've been too restrictive here.

TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

Could x and z be disconnected? Yes, they could. If y touches x's boundary at a point, and z touches y at a different point, then x and z could be disconnected. Think of it this way: if x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary, and z is another circle that touches y at a different point (not where y touches x), then x and z could be disconnected.

But wait, that's not right. If y is inside x, then any point of y is either inside x or on x's boundary. If z touches y, then z touches a point that's either inside x or on x's boundary. If that point is inside x, then z penetrates into x, meaning they overlap. If that point is on x's boundary, then z touches x's boundary, meaning they're externally connected. Either way, x and z aren't disconnected.

So, DC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let me reconsider this systematically, defining the relationships more precisely.

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x: y ⊂ x, y ≠ x.
- y touches x's boundary: bd(y) ∩ bd(x) ≠ ∅.

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries: bd(y) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅.
- y and z don't overlap: int(y) ∩ int(z) = ∅.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) means x and z don't share any points: x ∩ z = ∅.
   
   Given that y is a part of x, any point in y is also in x. If z touches y at a point p, then p ∈ y and p ∈ z. Since p ∈ y and y ⊂ x, we have p ∈ x. So, p ∈ x ∩ z, which contradicts DC(x,z). Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap: bd(x) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅, int(x) ∩ int(z) = ∅.
   
   For this to be true, z should touch x only at the boundary, not penetrate into its interior. If y touches both x's boundary and z, and z doesn't penetrate into x, then z would touch x at the boundary. EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap: int(x) ∩ int(z) ≠ ∅, x ⊄ z, z ⊄ x.
   
   For this to be true, z should penetrate into x's interior, and also extend outside of x. If y touches x's boundary and z touches y, then z could penetrate into x's interior while also extending outside. PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary: x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, bd(x) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅.
   
   For this to be true, x should be entirely inside z but touch z's boundary. Given that y is a part of x, y would also be a part of z. But EC(y,z) says y and z only touch at their boundaries, which contradicts y being a part of z. TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary: x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, bd(x) ∩ bd(z) = ∅.
   
   Similar to TPP, if x is a part of z, then y (being a part of x) would also be a part of z. This contradicts EC(y,z). NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary: z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, bd(z) ∩ bd(x) ≠ ∅.
   
   For this to be true, z should be entirely inside x but touch x's boundary. If z touches y at the point where y touches x's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary. TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary: z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, bd(z) ∩ bd(x) = ∅.
   
   For this to be true, z should be entirely inside x and not touch x's boundary. If z touches y at a point that's not where y touches x's boundary, then z would be inside x without touching its boundary. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region: x = z.
   
   If x and z are the same, then y (being a part of x) would also be a part of z. This contradicts EC(y,z). EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, once again:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible.
2. EC(x,z): Possible.
3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible.

I think this conclusion is solid. The possible relationships between x and z are EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I've overlooked a possibility.

In my analysis, I've considered that the point where y touches z (let's call it p) can either be on x's boundary or not. If p is on x's boundary, then z touches x's boundary, leading to either EC(x,z) or TPPi(x,z). If p is not on x's boundary, then z either penetrates into x's interior (leading to PO(x,z)) or is entirely inside x without touching its boundary (leading to NTPPi(x,z)).

What I missed is the possibility that z can touch y at multiple points. For instance, z could touch y at a point on x's boundary and also at a point not on x's boundary, or it could touch y at multiple points not on x's boundary. This complicates the analysis a bit.

But wait, I realize that the basic relations I've enumerated still cover all these cases:

- If z touches y at a point on x's boundary, it can either be externally connected to x (EC(x,z)) or be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)).
- If z touches y at a point not on x's boundary, it can either partially overlap with x (PO(x,z)) or be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)).

So, even considering multiple touching points, the possible relationships between x and z remain EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let's make sure I'm being precise in my analysis. I want to be really sure of my answer.

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is a proper part of x: y ⊂ x, y ≠ x.
- y touches x's boundary: bd(y) ∩ bd(x) ≠ ∅.

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries: bd(y) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅.
- y and z don't overlap: int(y) ∩ int(z) = ∅.

Given these, let's analyze what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

1. Since y is a proper part of x, every point in y is in x.
2. Since y and z touch at their boundaries, there's a point p such that p ∈ bd(y) and p ∈ bd(z).
3. Since p ∈ bd(y), it means p is on y's boundary.
4. Since p ∈ bd(z), it means p is on z's boundary.

Now, there are two possibilities for p:
- p ∈ bd(x): p is on x's boundary.
- p ∈ int(x): p is in x's interior.

Case 1: p ∈ bd(x).
If p is on x's boundary, and p is also on z's boundary, then x and z touch at p. This means x and z are in a relationship where they have a common boundary point.

Subcase 1.1: z extends outside of x.
If z has points outside of x, and x and z touch at their boundaries, then EC(x,z).

Subcase 1.2: z is entirely inside x.
If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z).

Case 2: p ∈ int(x).
If p is in x's interior, and p is on z's boundary, then z penetrates into x's interior.

Subcase 2.1: z has points outside of x.
If z has points outside of x and penetrates into x's interior, then PO(x,z).

Subcase 2.2: z is entirely inside x.
If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, there's another complexity. What if z touches y at multiple points? Let's consider a point q ≠ p such that q ∈ bd(y) and q ∈ bd(z).

If q ∈ bd(x), then z touches x's boundary at q.
If q ∈ int(x), then z penetrates into x's interior.

But I realize this just reverts to the cases I've already analyzed. If z touches x's boundary at any point, it's either EC(x,z) or TPPi(x,z). If z penetrates into x's interior, it's either PO(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. EC(x,z): If z touches x's boundary but doesn't penetrate into x's interior, and has points outside of x.
2. PO(x,z): If z penetrates into x's interior and also has points outside of x.
3. TPPi(x,z): If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary.
4. NTPPi(x,z): If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Ok, I realize there's a subtlety I'm missing:

Let's consider the point p where y and z touch. We know p ∈ bd(y) and p ∈ bd(z).

In the case where p ∈ bd(x), we need to be cautious. This doesn't automatically mean p ∈ bd(z) ∩ bd(x). It's possible that while p is on x's boundary, z at p could be "inside" x from the perspective of boundaries. In this case, z would not be externally connected to x.

But actually, I'm overthinking this. If p ∈ bd(y) and p ∈ bd(z), then p is on both y's and z's boundaries. If p ∈ bd(x), then p is also on x's boundary. Since p is on both x's and z's boundaries, x and z touch at their boundaries.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi, as I've concluded before.

But wait, let me think about this one more time just to be sure. For EC(x,z), I know that if y touches z, and y is inside x, then z must touch x (at least at the point where it touches y). If z extends outside of x, then EC(x,z). However, for TPP(x,z) (which I've said is not possible), I need to check if x could be inside z. If y is inside x, and x is inside z, then y is inside z. But EC(y,z) says y and z touch only at their boundaries, contradicting y being inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible. I've been consistent here.

For PO(x,z), I'm a bit more unsure. Let me make sure this is possible. For PO(x,z), x and z would overlap, and both would extend outside the overlapping region. 

Actually, let me try to draw this out conceptually.

For PO(x,z):
- x would be a region with some parts inside and some parts outside z.
- z would be a region with some parts inside and some parts outside x.
- There would be an overlapping region x ∩ z, which is neither the whole of x nor the whole of z.

Now, given TPPi(x,y), y would be inside x. Given EC(y,z), y would touch z at the boundary. 

Hang on, if z penetrates into x (which is what PO suggests), and y is entirely inside x, then z would cross y's boundary and penetrate into y, which contradicts EC(y,z).

Actually, no. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y from outside, then z doesn't necessarily penetrate into y. It could just touch y at the boundary. So, PO(x,z) is still possible.

Actually, this is a bit confusing. Let me draw a picture in my head:

Imagine a doughnut shape x. Inside the doughnut, there's a small ball y touching the inner boundary of the doughnut. Now, if another object z touches the small ball from the inner space of the doughnut, and z also extends outside the doughnut, then PO(x,z) would hold.

Or, imagine x as a hollow sphere, y as a small ball inside touching the inner surface of the sphere, and z as a rod that enters through a hole in the sphere, touches y, and then extends outside the sphere. In this case, PO(x,z) would hold.

Yep, PO(x,z) is certainly possible.

Let's finalize the possible relationships:

1. EC(x,z): Possible, if z touches x's boundary and doesn't penetrate into x's interior.
2. PO(x,z): Possible, if z penetrates into x's interior and also has parts outside of x.
3. TPPi(x,z): Possible, if z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary.
4. NTPPi(x,z): Possible, if z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

And the relationships that are not possible:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, because if y touches both x and z, then x and z share at least that point.
2. TPP(x,z): Not possible, as explained earlier.
3. NTPP(x,z): Not possible, for similar reasons as TPP.
4. EQ(x,z): Not possible, because if y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z, then x and z can't be the same region.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Hmm, wait, I'm now uncertain about TPPi(x,z). Let me double-check.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

For this to be true, z should be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), z touches y at the boundary. If z is entirely inside x and touches y at the boundary, then z might touch x's boundary if y touches x's boundary at the same point where it touches z. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For completeness, let me recheck NTPPi(x,z).

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

For this to be true, z should be entirely inside x and not touch x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), z touches y at the boundary. If z is entirely inside x and touches y at a point where y doesn't touch x's boundary, then z would be inside x without touching x's boundary. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships are indeed EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I'm having a last-minute doubt about TPPi(x,z). 

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, then z and x share a boundary point, let's call it p. Now, for EC(y,z) to hold, y and z should touch at their boundaries. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary at p, for y to touch z, y must at least touch z at p or at another point q. 

If y touches z at p, and p is on x's boundary, then y must also touch x's boundary at p. This is consistent with TPPi(x,y).

If y touches z at another point q, which is not on x's boundary, then q is in x's interior. For EC(y,z) to hold, q should be on y's boundary. This is again consistent.

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me do one final check for each relationship:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible.
2. EC(x,z): Possible.
3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, wait, I'm still not entirely convinced I've got this right yet. Let me think step-by-step more carefully:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x: y ⊂ x, y ≠ x.
- y touches x's boundary: bd(y) ∩ bd(x) ≠ ∅.

EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. This means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries: bd(y) ∩ bd(z) ≠ ∅.
- y and z don't overlap: int(y) ∩ int(z) = ∅.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any points.
   
   For this to be true, there should be no point that's both in x and z. But, given that y is inside x and touches z, there's at least one point p such that p ∈ y, p ∈ z, and (since y ⊂ x) p ∈ x. This contradicts DC(x,z). Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
   
   For this to be true, x and z should have a common boundary point but no common interior points. If y touches x's boundary at a point p, and z also touches y at a point q (which might or might not be the same as p), then z could touch x's boundary at q or another point. If z doesn't penetrate into x's interior, then EC(x,z) holds. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap.
   
   For this to be true, x and z should have common interior points, but neither should be entirely inside the other. If z touches y and then penetrates into x's interior, and also extends outside of x, then PO(x,z) holds. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z.
   
   For this to be true, x should be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x, if x is inside z, then y is inside z. But EC(y,z) says y and z touch only at their boundaries, which contradicts y being inside z. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   
   For this to be true, x should be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, if x is inside z, then y is inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x.
   
   For this to be true, z should be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. If z touches y at a point where y also touches x's boundary, then z would touch x's boundary, making TPPi(x,z) hold. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   
   For this to be true, z should be entirely inside x and not touch x's boundary. If z touches y at a point where y doesn't touch x's boundary, then z would be inside x without touching x's boundary, making NTPPi(x,z) hold. This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region.
   
   For this to be true, x and z should have the same points. Given that y is inside x, if x and z are the same, then y is inside z. But EC(y,z) says y and z touch only at their boundaries, which contradicts y being inside z. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

I've checked each relationship multiple times, and I'm now confident in my conclusion:

The possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z): Externally connected.
- PO(x,z): Partially overlapping.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

I'll analyze what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z based on the given conditions.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap)

Let me determine what's possible between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of x and y touches z, there must be at least one point common to both x and z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If z touches y at the point where y touches x's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary without overlapping with x.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If z touches y at its boundary but also extends into x in some areas and outside x in others, they would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then y (being inside x) would have to be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. Similar to TPP, this would require y to be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary (possibly at the same point where y touches x's boundary), then z is a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, then y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).
