PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. We're given that:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts.

We need to determine what relationship(s) could hold between x and z.

Let's consider the possibilities systematically:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible. If x partially overlaps with y, but is mostly outside of y, and z touches y only at a boundary point that is far from where x overlaps with y, then x and z could be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   This is also possible. If x overlaps with y in such a way that part of x's boundary coincides with part of y's boundary where z also touches y, then x and z could be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This seems less likely given the constraints, but let me think... If x extends beyond y's boundary into z's territory, then x and z could partially overlap. However, this conflicts with EC(y,z) which says y and z only touch at boundaries. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me reconsider. If y and z are externally connected (EC), and x partially overlaps with y, there could be a scenario where x extends beyond y's boundary at the point where y and z touch, allowing x to overlap with z as well. So PO(x,z) might be possible after all.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, it's not clear how x could be completely inside z. So TPP(x,z) seems implausible.

Actually, let me reconsider this as well. If x is partially in y, and the rest of x is completely in z, and x touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) could be possible. But given EC(y,z), y and z only touch at boundaries, so the part of x that's in y couldn't also be in z, which means x cannot be a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Similar to TPP, this would require x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Again, given that x partially overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, NTPP(x,z) seems implausible.

Actually, this is also not possible for the same reason as TPP. Since y and z only touch at boundaries, the part of x that's in y cannot also be in z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), z touches y at the boundary. For z to be completely inside x, x would need to cover all of z and extend beyond to overlap with y. This could be possible.

Actually, let me reconsider. If z is completely inside x, and z touches y at the boundary, then x must also touch y at the boundary (at least). But we're given that PO(x,y), which means x and y share some interior parts, not just boundary points. So z cannot be a tangential proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Again, given EC(y,z), z touches y at the boundary. For z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, x would need to extend well beyond z in all directions, including where z touches y. But if z touches y, and z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would have to penetrate through x's boundary to touch z, which contradicts PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical.
   Given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), x and z interact differently with y, so they cannot be identical. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident in my reasoning above. Let me try a different approach. I'll consider what PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) mean in terms of set theory, and then determine the possible relationships between x and z.

PO(x,y) means that x and y have a non-empty intersection, but neither is a subset of the other. That is, there are points in x that are not in y, and there are points in y that are not in x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but have empty interior intersection. That is, the intersection of y and z is non-empty, but the intersection of their interiors is empty.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

1. x and z could be completely separate, i.e., DC(x,z). This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y does not extend to the boundary of y where y touches z.

2. x and z could touch at a boundary, i.e., EC(x,z). This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y extends to the boundary of y where y touches z.

3. x and z could overlap, i.e., PO(x,z). This seems tricky, because if y and z only touch at the boundary, how could x overlap with both? But I guess it's possible if x extends beyond y into z.

Actually, let me think about this case more carefully. If y and z only touch at their boundaries, then they don't share any interior points. If x overlaps with y, then x shares some interior points with y. If x were to also overlap with z, then x would share some interior points with z. But since y and z don't share any interior points, the interior points of x that are in y cannot be in z, and vice versa. So for x to overlap with both y and z, x would have to "bridge" the boundary where y and z touch. This seems plausible, so PO(x,z) could be possible.

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z, i.e., TPP(x,z). This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x overlaps with y, and y only touches z at the boundary, then the part of x that's in y cannot be in z. So x cannot be completely inside z, which means TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z). Similar to TPP, this is not possible because the part of x that overlaps with y cannot be in z.

6. z could be a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPPi(x,z). This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. If y and z touch at the boundary, and z is inside x, then x must also touch y. But we know x and y overlap (share interior points), so they do more than just touch. The question is: can x contain z entirely, given that z touches y at the boundary and x overlaps with y? I think this is possible if x extends well beyond the boundary of y to encompass all of z.

Actually, wait. If z is completely inside x, and z touches y at the boundary, then x must also touch y at that same boundary point (at least). But we're given that PO(x,y), which means x and y share some interior parts. So x and y do more than just touch at the boundary; they overlap. This seems consistent with z being a tangential proper part of x. So TPPi(x,z) might be possible.

But let me double-check. If z is completely inside x, and z touches y at the boundary, then that boundary point is also a point in x. Since PO(x,y), x and y share some interior points, but neither is part of the other. So there are points in x that are not in y, and there are points in y that are not in x. The boundary point where y and z touch could be a point that's in both x and y, which is consistent with PO(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z). This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But if z touches y at the boundary, and z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then x's boundary must be strictly outside the boundary of z. This means that y would have to penetrate through x's boundary to touch z, which would make the relationship between x and y more complex than just PO. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, let me reconsider. If z is inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y at the boundary, then that boundary point of y is also a point inside x (not on x's boundary). This could be consistent with PO(x,y), which just requires x and y to share some points without either being part of the other. So NTPPi(x,z) might be possible.

But wait, if z touches y at the boundary, and that boundary point is inside x, then y must penetrate into x at that point. This would mean that at that point, y is not just touching x but is going inside x. This is consistent with PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. x and z could be identical, i.e., EQ(x,z). But if x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y would be the same as the relationship between z and y. But we're given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), which are different relationships. So x and z cannot be identical, which means EQ(x,z) is not possible.

OK, so based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I'm not fully convinced about NTPPi(x,z). Let me think more carefully. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y at the boundary, then that boundary point of y is also a point inside x. This means y penetrates into x at that point, which is consistent with PO(x,y). But if y and z touch at the boundary, then that boundary point is in both y and z. If that point is also inside x (not on x's boundary), then there's a point that's in all three regions. Is this possible given the constraints?

Hmm, actually I think the issue is with my interpretation of "touches at the boundary". EC(y,z) means y and z share some boundary points but no interior points. If a point is on the boundary of y and also on the boundary of z, then that point is not in the interior of either y or z. So my scenario where y penetrates into x doesn't work, because the point where y and z touch is on the boundary of both, not in the interior of either.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible. Because if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z touches y at the boundary, then that boundary point of y is also a point inside x (not on x's boundary). But that would mean the point is in the interior of x, on the boundary of y, and on the boundary of z. If the point is on the boundary of z, how can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?

Let me reconsider TPPi(x,z) as well. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, and z also touches y at the boundary, then the point where y and z touch is on the boundary of both y and z. This point would also have to be on the boundary of x (because z touches x's boundary). But then, the boundary of y, the boundary of z, and the boundary of x all intersect at this point. Is this consistent with PO(x,y)?

PO(x,y) means x and y share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. It doesn't say anything specific about the boundary. So it's possible that the boundary of x, the boundary of y, and the boundary of z all intersect at a point, while x and y also share some interior points. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me also reconsider PO(x,z). For x and z to partially overlap, they need to share some interior points. But if y and z only touch at the boundary, how can x overlap with both y and z? The interior points of x that are in y cannot be in z, and vice versa. So for x to overlap with both y and z, x would have to include the boundary point where y and z touch, and extend into both y and z. Is this possible?

Actually, I think it is. If the boundary of y, the boundary of z, and the boundary of x all intersect at a point, and x extends into both y and z, then x and z could share some interior points, which would make PO(x,z) possible.

OK, so based on this reconsideration, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

But wait. I'm getting confused by all the different cases. Let me try a more systematic approach. Let's consider what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
This is possible. If x partially overlaps with y but doesn't extend to the boundary where y touches z, then x and z can be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
This is also possible. If x extends to the boundary of y where y touches z, then x can touch z at that point, making them externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
For this to be true, x and z need to share some interior points. But since y and z don't share any interior points (they only touch at the boundary), the only way for x to share interior points with z is if x extends beyond the boundary of y into z. This seems plausible, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
For this to be true, all of x would need to be inside z, and x would touch the boundary of z. But since x overlaps with y (shares interior points with y), and y only touches z at the boundary (doesn't share interior points with z), there's no way for all of x to be inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
Similar to TPP, this is not possible because x overlaps with y, and y is mostly outside of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
For this to be true, all of z would need to be inside x, and z would touch the boundary of x. If z is entirely inside x, and z touches y at the boundary, then x must also touch y at that same boundary point (at least). This is consistent with PO(x,y), because x and y can share some interior points while also touching at the boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
For this to be true, all of z would need to be inside x, and z would not touch the boundary of x. But if z touches y at the boundary, and z is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary, then the boundary point of y where it touches z must be an interior point of x. But if y and z touch at their boundaries, then that point is on the boundary of both y and z, not in the interior of either. So if that point is an interior point of x, how can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? It seems like z would have to touch the boundary of x at that point. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical.
If x and z are identical, then the relationship between x and y would be the same as the relationship between z and y. But we're given PO(x,y) and EC(y,z), which are different relationships. So x and z cannot be identical, which means EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me think more about TPPi(x,z). For this to be true, z would need to be completely inside x, and z would touch the boundary of x. Also, z touches the boundary of y. So the boundary of y, the boundary of z, and the boundary of x all intersect at a point. This means that at that point, y is not going into the interior of x, but rather touching x at the boundary. But we're given PO(x,y), which means x and y share some interior points. This is still consistent, because x and y can share interior points at other locations, not necessarily at the point where y, z, and x all touch.

But wait, there's something else to consider. If z is completely inside x, and z touches y at the boundary, then the space occupied by z must be either part of y or not part of y. If it's part of y, then y cannot be touching z at the boundary, but rather overlapping with z, which contradicts EC(y,z). If it's not part of y, then z is entirely outside of y, and can only touch y at the boundary, which is consistent with EC(y,z). So z is entirely outside of y, touches y at the boundary, and is completely inside x. This means x spans across the boundary of y, which is consistent with PO(x,y).

So TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me check whether I've definitely ruled out PO(x,z). For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z need to share some interior points, but neither can be a subset of the other. Since y and z don't share any interior points (they only touch at the boundary), the only way for x to share interior points with z is if x extends beyond the boundary of y into z. This seems plausible, so PO(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Let me double-check if I've missed any possibilities:

1. x and y share interior points (PO), and y and z touch at boundary (EC).
2. If x is a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP), then all of x is in z. But since x shares interior points with y, and y doesn't share interior points with z, not all of x can be in z. So TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.
3. If x and z are identical (EQ), then x and y would have the same relationship as z and y, which is not the case. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.
4. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi), then z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But if z touches y at the boundary, and z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then the boundary point of y where it touches z must be an interior point of x. But that would mean z touches the boundary of x at that point, which contradicts z being a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.
5. The remaining possibilities are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

OK, so the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Actually, I'm still not sure about NTPPi(x,z). Let me try to visualize this case:
- y and z touch at their boundary, sharing no interior points.
- x shares interior points with y, but neither is a subset of the other.
- z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

If z touches y at the boundary, and z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then the boundary point of y where it touches z must be an interior point of x. This means y penetrates into the interior of x at that point. This is consistent with PO(x,y).

But if y and z touch at their boundaries, then that point is on the boundary of both y and z, not in the interior of either. So if that point is in the interior of x, then the boundary of z is in the interior of x, which means z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is consistent with z being a non-tangential proper part of x.

So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

But wait, I'm still confused. If z touches y at the boundary, and that boundary point is in the interior of x, then how is z not touching the boundary of x? Let me think step by step.

If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means the entire boundary of z is in the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x.

If y and z touch at the boundary, then they share some boundary points. These boundary points are on the boundary of both y and z, not in the interior of either.

If these boundary points are in the interior of x, then the boundary of z (at least where it touches y) is in the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x. This is consistent with z being a non-tangential proper part of x.

But, if y and x partially overlap, then they share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. This means there are interior points of y that are not in x, and there are interior points of x that are not in y. It doesn't say anything specific about the boundary. So it's possible that the boundary of y, where it touches z, is in the interior of x. This is consistent with PO(x,y).

So, if the boundary of y, where it touches z, is in the interior of x, and z is completely inside x without touching the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

OK, let me try to directly check whether NTPPi(x,z) is possible, by sketching out a concrete scenario.

Let's say y is a circular region, and z is another circular region that touches y at a single point (a tangent point) on the boundary. Now, let's say x is a much larger circular region that contains all of z and also overlaps with a portion of y. The tangent point where y and z touch is well within the interior of x, not on the boundary of x. In this scenario, we have:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x without touching the boundary of x.

So NTPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

So the final list of possible relationships between x and z is:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me double-check each of these:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x partially overlaps with y but doesn't extend to the boundary where y touches z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x extends to the boundary of y where y touches z, then x can touch z at that point.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x extends beyond the boundary of y into z, causing x and z to share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.

4. TPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is completely inside x, and z touches the boundary of x at the same point where z touches the boundary of y.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is completely inside x without touching the boundary of x, and the point where z touches the boundary of y is in the interior of x.

All of these relationships seem plausible given the constraints. So the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

So, the answer is DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Possible. If x partially overlaps with y but doesn't extend to where y touches z, then x and z can be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: Possible. If x extends to the boundary point where y and z touch, then x can touch z at that same boundary point.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: Possible. If x extends beyond the boundary of y into z's region, x and z can share interior points without either being contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: Not possible. Since x shares interior points with y (from PO(x,y)), and y only touches z at the boundary (from EC(y,z)), x cannot be completely contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part: Not possible. For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse Tangential Proper Part: Possible. Z can be completely inside x while touching x's boundary at the same point where z touches y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse Non-tangential Proper Part: Possible. Z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while the point where z touches y is in the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Not possible. If x and z were identical, they would have the same relationship with y, but we know PO(x,y) and EC(y,z) are different relations.
