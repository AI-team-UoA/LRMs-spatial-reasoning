PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me consider what we're being told:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- TPP(y, z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Now I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Let's think about this step by step.

We know that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary at some point.

We also know that x externally connects with y, meaning x and y touch at their boundaries but have no overlap.

So what are the possible relations between x and z?

1. Could x be disconnected from z (DC(x,z))?
   No, this isn't possible. Since x touches y (EC(x,y)), and y is inside z (TPP(y,z)), x must at least touch z at the point where it touches y.

2. Could x externally connect with z (EC(x,z))?
   Yes, if x only touches z at the boundary where y also touches z, then x and z would externally connect.

3. Could x partially overlap z (PO(x,z))?
   Yes, x could partially overlap with z. This happens if x extends into z beyond its contact point with y, but is not entirely contained in z.

4. Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))?
   Yes, x could be entirely contained within z and touch z's boundary.

5. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))?
   No, this isn't possible. Since x touches y, and y touches the boundary of z, x must also touch the boundary of z.

6. Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z))?
   No, because y is a part of z, and x only touches y externally, x cannot contain z.

7. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z))?
   No, for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. Could x be equal to z (EQ(x,z))?
   No, because y is a proper part of z, and x only externally connects with y, x cannot be equal to z.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)

Wait, let me double-check this by considering concrete examples.

Imagine:
- z is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point
- x is a circle that touches y at exactly one point

Case 1: If x touches y at the same point where y touches z, then x and z would touch at that point too, making EC(x,z) true.

Case 2: If x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z, then x could still be entirely outside z except for that touch point, again making EC(x,z) true.

Case 3: If x touches y at a point and extends partially into z, then PO(x,z) would be true.

Case 4: If x touches y at a point, is entirely contained within z, and also touches z's boundary at some point (possibly the same point where it touches y), then TPP(x,z) would be true.

So the possible relationships are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)

Hold on, I need to make sure of the TPP case. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely inside z. Given that EC(x,y), x touches y only at their boundaries. Since TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary. 

Let me think about whether x can be completely inside z while only touching y at the boundary. Yes, this is possible if x is positioned in such a way that it's inside z but only touches y at y's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

I've confirmed that the possible relations between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)

Actually let me think about this one more time. 

We know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

So the question is: what are the possible spatial relations between x and z?

DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
This would mean x and z share no points. But since x touches y, and y is inside z, x must at least touch z. So this isn't possible.

EC(x,z) - Externally Connected:
This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, so x also touches the boundary of z.

PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping:
This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if part of x extends into z beyond its touch point with y, but another part of x is outside z.

TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part:
This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is positioned in such a way that it's inside z, touches y at y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary.

NTPP(x,z) - Non-Tangential Proper Part:
This would mean x is completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary. I think this is possible if x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x itself doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Actually, let me reconsider the NTPP case. 
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

If x touches y only at their boundaries, and y touches the boundary of z, it doesn't necessarily mean x touches the boundary of z. X could touch y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of z. In this case, if x is completely inside z, then NTPP(x,z) would be true.

So NTPP(x,z) is also a possibility.

TPPi(x,z) - Inverse Tangential Proper Part:
This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This isn't possible because y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary. So z cannot be inside x.

NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part:
Similarly, this would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

EQ(x,z) - Equal:
This would mean x and z are the same region. This isn't possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only externally connects with y.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me actually check the NTPP(x,z) case again, as I'm not sure about it.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. Given that EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), let's see if this is possible.

EC(x,y) means x touches y only at their boundaries. TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x itself doesn't extend to the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) could be true. 

So NTPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's make sure that I'm not missing anything.

DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Not possible, as explained.
EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: Possible, as explained.
PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: Possible, as explained.
TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: Possible, as explained.
NTPP(x,z) - Non-Tangential Proper Part: Possible, as explained.
TPPi(x,z) - Inverse Tangential Proper Part: Not possible, as explained.
NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part: Not possible, as explained.
EQ(x,z) - Equal: Not possible, as explained.

So my final answer is:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I realize I need to be really careful about NTPP(x,z). Let me analyze it once more.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true:
- x must be completely inside z (including x's boundary)
- x must not touch z's boundary anywhere

Given that:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Now, if x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x won't necessarily touch z's boundary. But we need to be sure that x is completely inside z.

Since y is completely inside z, and x touches y only at their boundaries, x will have at least one point that's on the boundary of y. That point must be inside z (because y is inside z). The rest of x could be completely inside z too.

So yes, NTPP(x,z) is possible if x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and the rest of x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I'm confident that these are all the possible relationships given the constraints.

Actually, let me do one more thorough check. I need to see if I've missed anything or if any of my conclusions are incorrect. I'll reconsider the assumptions and each of the eight relations.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Let's check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   This would mean x and z share no points. But since x touches y, and y is inside z, x must at least share a point with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected:
   This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible if x touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, and the rest of x is outside z.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping:
   This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if part of x extends into z beyond its touch point with y, and another part of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part:
   This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is positioned in such a way that it's inside z, touches y at y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-Tangential Proper Part:
   This means x is completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x itself is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse Tangential Proper Part:
   This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This isn't possible because y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary. So z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part:
   Similarly, this would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   This would mean x and z are the same region. This isn't possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only externally connects with y.

Based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I'm confident that these are all the possible relationships given the constraints.

Actually, wait a minute. I want to check once more time to make sure that the NTPP(x,z) case is truly possible. 

For NTPP(x,z) to be true:
- x must be completely inside z
- x must not touch z's boundary anywhere

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Let's imagine a specific scenario:
- z is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point (call it point P)
- x is a small circle that touches y at a point Q, where Q is not the same as P

In this scenario, is it possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

Yes, if Q is chosen such that it's on y's boundary but far from point P, and x is small enough, then x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. In this case, NTPP(x,z) would be true.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I've checked this multiple times and I'm confident in this answer.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let me analyze what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Going through each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since x touches y and y is inside z, x must at least touch z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x can externally connect with z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If part of x extends into z beyond its touch point with y, while another part remains outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. If x touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside z and x only touches y at the boundary, z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since y is a proper part of z, and x only externally connects with y.

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
