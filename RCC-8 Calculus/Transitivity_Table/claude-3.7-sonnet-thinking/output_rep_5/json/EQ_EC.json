{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.\n\nGiven:\n- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)\n- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts\n\nSince x and y are coincident (EQ), they occupy precisely the same region with the same boundaries. Therefore, x will have exactly the same spatial relationship with z that y has with z.\n\nSince y is externally connected to z (EC), then x must also be externally connected to z.\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 6.334399223327637, "reasoning-tokens": 400, "completion-tokens": 400}
