{"prompt": "If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given:\n- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share parts, but neither is part of the other)\n- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they are the same region)\n\nSince y and z are the same region (EQ(y,z)), any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. \n\nIf x partially overlaps with y, and y is the same region as z, then x must also partially overlap with z.\n\n### Answer: PO(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 10.996572971343994, "reasoning-tokens": 793, "completion-tokens": 793}
