{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given information:\n- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)\n- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)\n\nSince EQ(x,y) means that x and y are spatially identical, they must have the same relationship with any third region. Since y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x is identical to y, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.\n\n### Answer: TPP(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 8.616856575012207, "reasoning-tokens": 565, "completion-tokens": 565}
