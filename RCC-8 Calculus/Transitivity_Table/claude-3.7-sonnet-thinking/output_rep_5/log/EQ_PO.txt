PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step:

We know that:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are the same region)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other)

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are exactly the same region, any spatial relation that holds between y and z must also hold between x and z.

Given that PO(y,z) holds, and x is the same as y, then the relation between x and z must also be PO(x,z).

So the answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this reasoning.

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are the same region, so they have exactly the same spatial extent and boundaries.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

Since x is exactly the same as y (due to EQ(x,y)), and y partially overlaps with z (due to PO(y,z)), then x must also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way that y does.

So the only possible relation between x and z is PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z), then what is the relationship between x and z?

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (exactly the same region), x must have exactly the same relationship with z that y has with z.

Given that y partially overlaps with z (PO(y,z)), x must also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
