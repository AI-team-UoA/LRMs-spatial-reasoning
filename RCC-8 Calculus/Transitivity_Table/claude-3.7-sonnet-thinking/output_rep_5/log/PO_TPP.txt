PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what spatial relation holds between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's break down what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now let's analyze what these two facts tell us about the possible relationship between x and z.

Since PO(x,y), there's a part of x that overlaps with y, and there's also a part of x that's outside of y.
Since TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z (touching z's boundary).

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is impossible because x shares a part with y, and y is inside z, so x must share at least that part with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This is possible. The part of x that overlaps with y would be inside z, and if the rest of x is outside z but touches z's boundary, then x and z would be externally connected.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This is possible. If part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y) and part of x is outside z, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This is possible. If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This is possible. If x is completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: This is impossible. This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, but we know y is inside z and shares parts with x, so z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This is impossible because x and y partially overlap, and y is a proper part of z, so x and z cannot be equal.

Actually, let me think more carefully about these cases. I'm not sure I've analyzed all of them correctly.

Let's consider what PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) tell us:

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y share some part
- x has some part outside y
- y has some part outside x

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is completely inside z
- y touches z's boundary

Given these constraints:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is impossible because x shares a part with y, and y is inside z, so x must share at least that part with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This is actually impossible too. Since x shares a part with y, and y is completely inside z, at least part of x must be inside z. For EC(x,z) to be true, x would have to be completely outside z except for touching at the boundary, which contradicts that x shares a part with y.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This is possible. The part of x that overlaps with y would be inside z, and if part of x extends outside z, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This is possible. If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This is possible. If x is completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since y is a proper part of z, and x and y partially overlap, this would create a contradiction. So this is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This is impossible because y is a proper part of z, and x and y partially overlap, so x and z cannot be equal.

Actually, let me think more carefully about case 6 and 7. I'm not sure I've analyzed them correctly.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that TPP(y,z), we know y is inside z, touching z's boundary. And given PO(x,y), we know x and y share some part, x has some part outside y, and y has some part outside x.

If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x, touching x's boundary. Since y is inside z (from TPP(y,z)), y would also be inside x. But PO(x,y) says y has some part outside x, which creates a contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. The same contradiction arises as with TPPi.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me think about this problem more systematically.

Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), let's consider the spatial regions involved:

PO(x,y) tells us:
- x and y share some spatial part (call it "intersection")
- x has some part outside y (call it "x_only")
- y has some part outside x (call it "y_only")

TPP(y,z) tells us:
- y is completely inside z
- y touches z's boundary

Since y is completely inside z, both "intersection" and "y_only" are inside z.

Now let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is impossible because "intersection" is inside both x and z, so x and z share a part.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This is impossible because "intersection" is inside both x and z, so x and z share more than just a boundary point.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This is possible if "x_only" extends outside z. In this case, x and z would share a part ("intersection" and possibly some of "x_only"), but neither would be part of the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This is possible if all of x (including "x_only") is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. Given that y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)), it's possible for x to also touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This is possible if all of x is inside z, but x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since y is inside z (from TPP(y,z)), and PO(x,y) says y has some part outside x, this is a contradiction. So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This is impossible because y is a proper part of z, and x and y partially overlap, so x and z cannot be equal.

Actually, I realize that I'm still not confident in my reasoning, especially about cases 6 and 7. Let me try to understand this using a different approach.

Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), I'll consider what these tell us about the regions:

PO(x,y):
- x ∩ y ≠ ∅ (they share a part)
- x - y ≠ ∅ (x has a part outside y)
- y - x ≠ ∅ (y has a part outside x)

TPP(y,z):
- y ⊂ z (y is a proper subset of z)
- y touches the boundary of z

From PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we know:
- x ∩ y ≠ ∅ and y ⊂ z, so x ∩ z ≠ ∅ (x and z share a part)

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This is impossible because x and z share a part (as shown above).

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: This is impossible for the same reason.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: This is possible if x has a part outside z. Since x has a part outside y (from PO(x,y)), and y is inside z, it's possible for that part of x to be outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: This is possible if all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary. Given that y touches z's boundary, it's possible for x to also touch z's boundary if x and y share a boundary point on z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: This is possible if all of x is inside z but x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, so z ⊂ x and z touches x's boundary. But since y ⊂ z (from TPP(y,z)), and y has a part outside x (from PO(x,y)), there would be a part of z outside x, which contradicts z ⊂ x. So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This would mean x = z. But since y ⊂ z (from TPP(y,z)), and y has a part outside x (from PO(x,y)), there would be a part of z outside x, which contradicts x = z. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

To double-check my reasoning, I'll come up with concrete examples for each of these cases:

For PO(x,z):
- Imagine x as a circle that partially overlaps with a smaller circle y, and y is a tangential proper part of a larger circle z. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but part of x extends outside z.

For TPP(x,z):
- Imagine y as a small circle that's a tangential proper part of a larger circle z, and x as another circle that partially overlaps with y but is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z):
- Same as the TPP case, but x doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me try one more time to be absolutely sure about this.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z

Let's explore the possibilities for the relationship between x and z.

First, I need to note that since TPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary. And since PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some part, but neither is part of the other.

I can rule out the following:

- DC(x,z): Impossible because x shares a part with y, and y is inside z, so x and z must share at least that part.
- EC(x,z): Impossible for the same reason as DC.
- TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since y is a proper part of z, and y has a part outside x (from PO(x,y)), there would be a part of z outside x, contradicting the definition of TPPi.
- NTPPi(x,z): Impossible for the same reason as TPPi.
- EQ(x,z): Impossible because y is a proper part of z, and x and y partially overlap, so x and z cannot be equal.

Now for the possibilities:

- PO(x,z): This is possible if part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y) and part of x is outside z.
- TPP(x,z): This is possible if all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): This is possible if all of x is inside z but x doesn't touch z's boundary.

To construct a concrete example for each of these cases:

For PO(x,z):
- Imagine y as a small circle that's a tangential proper part of a larger circle z, and x as another circle that partially overlaps with y and extends outside z.

For TPP(x,z):
- Imagine y as a small circle that's a tangential proper part of a larger circle z, and x as another circle that partially overlaps with y, is completely inside z, and touches z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z):
- Imagine y as a small circle that's a tangential proper part of a larger circle z, and x as another circle that partially overlaps with y, is completely inside z, but doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I am confident that these are the only possible relationships.

One last sanity check: I am given that PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z). 

For PO(x,y):
- x and y partially overlap
- x has a part outside y
- y has a part outside x

For TPP(y,z):
- y is completely inside z
- y touches z's boundary

Let's think about each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: If x and z are disconnected, then there's no part of x inside z. But since x and y partially overlap, and y is inside z, part of x must be inside z. So this is impossible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: If x and z are externally connected, then they share no interior parts, only a boundary. But since x and y partially overlap, and y is inside z, part of x must be inside z. So this is impossible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: If x and z partially overlap, then part of x is inside z and part of x is outside z. This is possible because the part of x that overlaps with y would be inside z, and the part of x outside y could be outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part: If x is a tangential proper part of z, then all of x is inside z and x touches z's boundary. This is possible if the part of x outside y is still inside z, and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part: If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if the part of x outside y is still inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part: If z is a tangential proper part of x, then all of z is inside x and z touches x's boundary. But since y is inside z, and y has a part outside x, part of z must be outside x. So this is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part: Similarly, if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then all of z is inside x. But since y is inside z, and y has a part outside x, part of z must be outside x. So this is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: If x and z are equal, then they are the same region. But since y is a proper part of z, and y has a part outside x, there's a part of z outside x. So this is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I realize I'm still not 100% confident in my reasoning. Let me try to visualize this.

- PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap. So they share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Given these two facts, I want to determine what is the relationship between x and z.

For x and z to be DC (disconnected), they would need to have no part in common. But since x shares a part with y, and y is inside z, x and z must share at least that part. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For x and z to be EC (externally connected), they would need to touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. But since x shares an interior part with y, and y is inside z, x and z must share an interior part. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For x and z to be PO (partially overlapping), they would need to share a part, but neither would be fully contained in the other. This is possible if the part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, and the part of x that doesn't overlap with y is outside z.

For x and z to be TPP (tangential proper part), all of x would need to be inside z, and x would need to touch z's boundary. This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y is still inside z, and x touches z's boundary.

For x and z to be NTPP (non-tangential proper part), all of x would need to be inside z, and x would not touch z's boundary. This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y is still inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

For x and z to be TPPi (inverse tangential proper part), all of z would need to be inside x, and z would touch x's boundary. But since y is inside z, and y is not fully contained in x (due to PO(x,y)), part of z must be outside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For x and z to be NTPPi (inverse non-tangential proper part), all of z would need to be inside x, and z would not touch x's boundary. But since y is inside z, and y is not fully contained in x, part of z must be outside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For x and z to be EQ (equal), they would need to be the same region. But since y is fully contained in z, and y is not fully contained in x, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually I had an insight, let me see if I can make a table to check all of these.

Let's define regions based on the Venn diagram of x, y, and z:
- A: The part of x that's outside both y and z
- B: The part of x that's outside y but inside z
- C: The part of x that's inside both y and z
- D: The part of y that's inside z but outside x
- E: The part of z that's outside both x and y

Given PO(x,y), we know C and D are non-empty, and since TPP(y,z), we know C, D are inside z. We don't know a priori if A, B, or E are empty or not.

Now let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disjoint. But we know C is inside both x and z, so this is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but share no interior. But we know C is in the interior of both x and z, so this is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This requires C to be non-empty (which it is) and at least one of A or E to be non-empty. If A is non-empty, we're good. If A is empty but B and E are non-empty, we're also good.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This requires A to be empty, B to be non-empty, and x to touch the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This requires A to be empty, B to be non-empty, and x to not touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This requires E to be empty, which means D should also be empty (since D is inside z). But we know D is non-empty (from PO(x,y)), so this is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This requires A and E to be empty. But if E is empty, then D should also be empty (since D is inside z). But we know D is non-empty, so this is impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): if A is non-empty
- TPP(x,z): if A is empty, B is non-empty, and x touches the boundary of z
- NTPP(x,z): if A is empty, B is non-empty, and x does not touch the boundary of z

Let me check one more thing. We know that y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)). Let's consider what happens in the TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) cases:

In the TPP(x,z) case, x touches the boundary of z. This is possible even though y also touches the boundary of z, because the boundary-touching parts of x and y don't have to be the same.

In the NTPP(x,z) case, x does not touch the boundary of z. This is also possible. Even though y touches the boundary of z, the part of y that touches the boundary can be outside x (in region D).

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me try to create a concrete example of each possible case to further convince myself:

1. PO(x,z): Imagine y is a circle, z is a larger circle containing y, and x is another circle that partially overlaps with y and extends outside z. The part of x inside y is also inside z, but the part of x outside y can be partially or completely outside z.

2. TPP(x,z): Imagine y is a circle, z is a larger circle containing y, and x is another circle that partially overlaps with y, is completely inside z, and touches the boundary of z.

3. NTPP(x,z): Imagine y is a circle, z is a larger circle containing y, and x is another circle that partially overlaps with y, is completely inside z, and does not touch the boundary of z.

So, the answer to the question "If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), or NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Impossible because x shares a part with y (from PO), and y is inside z (from TPP), so x and z must share at least that part.

2. EC(x,z) - Impossible for the same reason as DC. Since x and y share interior parts, and y is inside z, x and z must share interior parts.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. The part of x that overlaps with y would be inside z, and the part of x outside y could extend outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. All of x could be inside z (including the part not overlapping with y), and x could touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible. All of x could be inside z and not touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Impossible. This would mean z is inside x, but since y is inside z (from TPP(y,z)), and y has parts outside x (from PO(x,y)), z must have parts outside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Impossible because y is a proper part of z, and y is not a proper part of x (from PO(x,y)), so x and z cannot be equal.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
