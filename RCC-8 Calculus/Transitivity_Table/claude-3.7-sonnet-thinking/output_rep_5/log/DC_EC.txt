PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z given that DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let's recall the RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x) (y is part of x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x) (y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary)
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (the same region)

Given information:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries

What can we say about the relation between x and z?

Let's think through the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. If x is disconnected from y, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x can be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. x could touch z at the boundary while still being disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z could overlap while x remains disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z while remaining disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z while remaining disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x while x remains disconnected from y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x while x remains disconnected from y.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be coincident while x remains disconnected from y.

Wait, I need to be more careful. Let's analyze each possibility more rigorously:

1. DC(x,z): Yes, x can be disconnected from z while also being disconnected from y which touches z.

2. EC(x,z): Yes, x can touch z at the boundary while still being disconnected from y which also touches z (at a different boundary point).

3. PO(x,z): Yes, x can partially overlap with z while still being disconnected from y which touches z at the boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z while being disconnected from y which touches z at the boundary? Yes, x could be inside z but not touching the same boundary that y touches.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z while being disconnected from y which touches z at the boundary? Yes, x could be completely inside z, away from its boundaries.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x while x is disconnected from y which touches z at the boundary? This seems contradictory. If z is a part of x and z touches y, then x must also touch y (since z's boundary points are also x's boundary points), which contradicts DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x while x is disconnected from y which touches z at the boundary? This is contradictory for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be the same region while x is disconnected from y which touches z at the boundary? No, because if x and z are the same, and z touches y, then x must also touch y, contradicting DC(x,y).

So the possible relations between x and z given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I need to rethink relation 6 (TPPi). 

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x. Since EC(y,z), y touches z at the boundary. Since z is inside x and touches x's boundary, if y touches z at the boundary, it's possible that this boundary is not shared with x. In that case, y would not necessarily touch x, allowing DC(x,y) to be true.

Wait, that's not correct. If z is a tangential proper part of x, then all of z is contained within x, including z's boundary. If y touches z's boundary, then y must also touch x's boundary, contradicting DC(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. If y touches z's boundary, then y must be inside x as well (since z is completely inside x without touching its boundary). This means y and x would have to share points, contradicting DC(x,y).

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same region, and y touches z at the boundary, then y must also touch x at the boundary, contradicting DC(x,y).

So my revised list of possible relations between x and z is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, I think I've been making a mistake in my reasoning about TPPi and NTPPi. Let me be more precise:

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y touches z at the boundary (EC(y,z)), and this boundary point is also a boundary point of x, then y would touch x as well, contradicting DC(x,y). But if y touches z at a boundary point that's inside x (not on x's boundary), then y would have to be partially inside x, again contradicting DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. If y touches z's boundary (EC(y,z)), then y would have to be partially inside x, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same region, and y touches z at the boundary (EC(y,z)), then y must also touch x at the boundary, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me review TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) as well:

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This is compatible with DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) if y touches z at a different part of z's boundary than where x touches it.

For NTPP(x,z), x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is compatible with DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) as y can touch z's boundary while x is disconnected from y inside z.

Let me also double-check PO(x,z):

For PO(x,z), x and z share some region, but neither is contained in the other. This is compatible with DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) if y touches z at a part of z's boundary that doesn't overlap with x.

So the final list of possible relations between x and z is:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me verify the consistency once more for each relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is consistent with DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) if y touches z at a point far from x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary. This is consistent with DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) if y touches z at a different boundary point than where x touches z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is consistent with DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) if y touches z at a boundary point outside the overlapping region with x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is consistent with DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) if y touches z at a boundary point away from where x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is consistent with DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) as y can touch z's boundary while x is completely inside z away from the boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then there are two cases:
   - If y touches z at a point where z touches x's boundary, then y would also touch x, contradicting DC(x,y).
   - If y touches z at a boundary point of z that's interior to x, then y would be partially inside x, again contradicting DC(x,y).
   So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then y would have to be partially inside x, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y touches z at the boundary (EC(y,z)), then y must also touch x at the boundary, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me double-check my reasoning for TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ:

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), then y must interact with a part of z that's either:
1. At x's boundary (where z touches x) - in which case y would also touch x, contradicting DC(x,y)
2. Inside x (not at x's boundary) - in which case y would have to be partially inside x to touch z, again contradicting DC(x,y)

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. If y touches z at its boundary (EC(y,z)), y would have to be partially inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same region, and y touches z at the boundary, then y must also touch x at the boundary (since x and z are the same), contradicting DC(x,y).

I believe my analysis is correct. The possible relations between x and z given DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Since the question asked for all possible relationships, the answer is DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze which RCC-8 relations between x and z are consistent with the given information: DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me examine each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be disconnected from z while y touches z at the boundary and remains disconnected from x.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z at a boundary point different from where y touches z, while x and y remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can partially overlap z while y touches z at a boundary point outside the overlap region, keeping x and y disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z touching z's boundary, while y touches z at a different boundary point, allowing x and y to be disconnected.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), while y touches z at the boundary, keeping x and y disconnected.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were a tangential proper part of x, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would either touch x's boundary or be partially inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were completely inside x, and y touches z at its boundary, then y would have to be partially inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, and y touches z at the boundary, then y would also touch x, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
