PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

Given:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.

Now, let's figure out the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are coincident. This means that y and z are the same spatial region. So any relationship that x has with y, x will also have with z.

Given TPP(x,y), we know that x is a tangential proper part of y. Since y and z are coincident, x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z is:

TPP(x,z)

This is the only possible relationship.

Let me double-check: 
- x is a tangential proper part of y
- y is equivalent to z
- Therefore, x must be a tangential proper part of z

This is because the spatial regions y and z are identical, so any relation to y must also hold for z.

So, the answer is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z based on the given conditions:

1. TPP(x,y) - x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
2. EQ(y,z) - y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent, any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)), and y is identical to z, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
