PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). Let's think about what these relations mean:

PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely contained within z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now I need to consider what these two facts together imply about the possible relationship between x and z. I'll analyze this systematically by considering each of the 8 possible RCC-8 relations and whether they are possible for x and z.

1. DC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   - We know that x and y share some part (due to PO(x,y))
   - We know that y is completely inside z (due to NTPP(y,z))
   - If x and y share a part, and that part of y is inside z, then x and z must share that part too
   - Therefore, x and z cannot be disconnected
   - DC(x,z) is not possible

2. EC(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z externally connect (touch at boundary)?
   - We know that x and y partially overlap, so some part of x is inside y
   - We know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary
   - If part of x is inside y, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then that part of x must also be inside z
   - This means x and z must share some interior point, not just boundary points
   - Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible

3. PO(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   - Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, part of x must be inside z
   - But does all of x have to be inside z? No, x could extend beyond z
   - Therefore, PO(x,z) is possible

4. TPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   - x could be completely inside z (since it shares a part with y which is inside z)
   - And x could touch the boundary of z
   - Nothing in our premises prevents this
   - Therefore, TPP(x,z) is possible

5. NTPP(x,z) - Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   - x could be completely inside z without touching its boundary
   - Nothing in our premises prevents this
   - Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is possible

6. TPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   - We know that y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z))
   - So z cannot be inside x, as this would create a contradiction with the partial overlap of x and y
   - Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   - Similar to the above, z cannot be inside x
   - Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible

8. EQ(x,z) - Is it possible that x and z are equal?
   - If x and z were equal, then we would have PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,x)
   - But this is a contradiction because if y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then x cannot partially overlap y
   - Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible

Actually, wait a minute, I need to be more careful about my reasoning. Let me reanalyze the cases where I'm unsure.

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), I need to check more carefully if they're possible.

If TPPi(x,z), then z would be a tangential proper part of x. But we know NTPP(y,z), meaning y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is completely inside z, which is completely inside x.

But we also know PO(x,y), which means x and y partially overlap, with neither being completely inside the other. This contradicts the conclusion that y must be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) would imply z is completely inside x, which leads to the same contradiction with PO(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z were equal, then NTPP(y,z) would become NTPP(y,x), meaning y is completely inside x without touching its boundary. But this contradicts PO(x,y), which says x and y partially overlap with neither being completely inside the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I need to double-check my reasoning for PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) to make sure they're correct.

For PO(x,z):
- Part of x overlaps with y (from PO(x,y))
- All of y is inside z without touching z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z))
- So part of x must be inside z
- But not all of x has to be inside z
- So x and z can partially overlap
- Therefore, PO(x,z) is possible

For TPP(x,z):
- It's possible that all of x is inside z
- And it's possible that part of x touches z's boundary
- Nothing in our premises prevents this
- Therefore, TPP(x,z) is possible

For NTPP(x,z):
- It's possible that all of x is inside z
- And it's possible that no part of x touches z's boundary
- Nothing in our premises prevents this
- Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is possible

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's confirm once more by thinking about specific examples:

Example 1: Imagine y is a small circle inside a larger circle z, not touching z's boundary. Now imagine x as a shape that partially overlaps with y (sharing some area) but extends beyond both y and z. In this case, x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z) is possible.

Example 2: Imagine y is a small circle inside a larger circle z, not touching z's boundary. Now imagine x as a shape that partially overlaps with y but is completely inside z, with part of x touching z's boundary. In this case, TPP(x,z) holds.

Example 3: Imagine y is a small circle inside a larger circle z, not touching z's boundary. Now imagine x as a shape that partially overlaps with y and is completely inside z, without touching z's boundary. In this case, NTPP(x,z) holds.

These examples confirm that PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are all possible relationships between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Actually, let me revisit the case for DC(x,z) because I'm not sure my reasoning was correct.

If DC(x,z), then x and z share no spatial parts. But we know PO(x,y), so x and y share some spatial part. And we know NTPP(y,z), so y is completely inside z. If part of x overlaps with y, and all of y is inside z, then that part of x must also be inside z. This means x and z must share some spatial part, contradicting DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me revisit the case for EC(x,z) as well.

If EC(x,z), then x and z touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts. But again, if part of x overlaps with y, and all of y is inside z (including y's interior), then that part of x must overlap with z's interior. This contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I want to double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z). I initially said it's possible, but let me make sure.

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, so x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

We know PO(x,y), so x and y share some part, but neither is completely contained in the other. This means some part of x is outside y.

We know NTPP(y,z), so y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, all of x would need to be inside z, and part of x would need to touch z's boundary. This seems compatible with our premises, as long as the part of x that extends beyond y stays within z and touches z's boundary.

So yes, TPP(x,z) is possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let me analyze each relation systematically:

1. PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap - they share some interior parts but neither is contained within the other.
2. NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Now for the possible relations between x and z:

- PO(x,z): Possible. Since x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, part of x must be inside z. But since x extends beyond y (from PO(x,y)), x could also extend beyond z's boundary.

- TPP(x,z): Possible. All of x could be contained within z (while still partially overlapping with y), with some part of x touching z's boundary.

- NTPP(x,z): Possible. All of x could be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

- DC, EC, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ: Not possible. These all contradict our premises because:
  * If x and y overlap, and y is inside z, then x must share some part with z
  * z cannot be contained in x while y is contained in z and x only partially overlaps with y
  * x cannot equal z while partially overlapping with y that's inside z

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
