PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We have the following information:
- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's reason through the possibilities.

Given DC(x,y), we know x and y don't share any part, they are completely disconnected.
Given TPP(y,z), we know y is a part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, what could be the relationship between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x is disconnected from y, and y is inside z, so x can also be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x is disconnected from y, but x could touch the boundary of z at a point where y doesn't touch.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x is disconnected from y, but x could partially overlap with parts of z that don't contain y.

4. TPP(x,z): This is not possible. For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be inside z and touch z's boundary. But x is disconnected from y, and y is inside z. If x is inside z and disconnected from y, then there's a region of z that contains x and doesn't contain y. This means x is a proper part of z, but it's not clear if it's tangential or not.

Wait, let me rethink TPP(x,z). TPP(x,z) would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is already a TPP of z, and x is disconnected from y, there's a part of z that contains x, and this part is disconnected from y. So, x could be a TPP of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. x could be inside z without touching z's boundary, and still be disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But this is impossible because TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, and DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected. If z were inside x, then y would also be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, this is impossible for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, and DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected. If x and z were the same, then y would be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

Let me double-check my reasoning:

For TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is also a tangential proper part of z, and x is disconnected from y, x and y would be two separate regions inside z. This is consistent with the given conditions.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is inside z without touching z's boundary. Again, since y is a tangential proper part of z, and x is disconnected from y, x and y would be two separate regions inside z. This is consistent.

For TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But if y is a tangential proper part of z, then y would also be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

Actually, let me rethink.

1. **DC(x,z)**: x is disconnected from z. Since TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, and DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, x can also be disconnected from z. This is valid.

2. **EC(x,z)**: x externally connects to z. This means x touches the boundary of z but doesn't share an interior part. Since TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, x can touch z's boundary at a different point from where y touches. This is valid.

3. **PO(x,z)**: x partially overlaps with z. This means x and z share a part, but neither is a part of the other. Since TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, and DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected, x can overlap with parts of z that don't include y. This is valid.

4. **TPP(x,z)**: x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. As I reasoned earlier, this is consistent with the given conditions. x and y can be two separate tangential proper parts of z. This is valid.

5. **NTPP(x,z)**: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z without touching z's boundary. Again, this is consistent with the given conditions. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z, while y is a tangential proper part, and they can still be disconnected. This is valid.

6. **TPPi(x,z)**: z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, so y would also be inside x. This contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not valid.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)**: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x without touching x's boundary. Again, this would imply y is inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not valid.

8. **EQ(x,z)**: x and z are the same region. But if x and z are the same, and TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, then y would be inside x. This contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not valid.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z.
- EC(x,z): x externally connects to z.
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Wait, I need to reconsider a few things.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. They don't share any parts.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

For DC(x,z): 
This would mean x is outside of z. And since y is inside z, this would mean x and y are disconnected. This is consistent with DC(x,y). So, DC(x,z) is possible.

For EC(x,z): 
This would mean x touches the boundary of z but doesn't share an interior part with z. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, x and y could potentially meet at the boundary of z. 

But wait, if both x and y touch the boundary of z at the same point, would they still be disconnected? Let's think about it. DC(x,y) means x and y don't share any points, including boundary points. So, if x and y both touch the boundary of z, they must do so at different points for them to remain disconnected. This is possible, so EC(x,z) is valid.

For PO(x,z): 
This would mean x and z share some interior parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. If x overlaps with parts of z that don't include y, then x and y can remain disconnected. This is consistent with DC(x,y). So, PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z): 
This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is also inside z and touches z's boundary, x and y must touch z's boundary at different points (or regions) for them to remain disconnected. This is possible, so TPP(x,z) is valid.

For NTPP(x,z): 
This would mean x is inside z without touching z's boundary. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, x would be deeper inside z than y, keeping them disconnected. This is consistent with DC(x,y). So, NTPP(x,z) is valid.

For TPPi(x,z): 
This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, so y would also be inside x. This contradicts DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not valid.

For NTPPi(x,z): 
This would mean z is inside x without touching x's boundary. Again, this would imply y is inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not valid.

For EQ(x,z): 
This would mean x and z are the same region. But TPP(y,z) means y is inside z, so y would be inside x. This contradicts DC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not valid.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z.
- EC(x,z): x externally connects to z.
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let's once more verify that EC(x,z) is a possible relation. If EC(x,z), then x touches the boundary of z. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches the boundary of z. Since DC(x,y), x and y must be disconnected, which means they cannot touch. So if x touches the boundary of z at a point p, and y touches the boundary of z at a point q, we must have p != q for x and y to remain disconnected. This is possible, so EC(x,z) is a valid relation.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

In summary: 
If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), I'll analyze what each condition tells us:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, sharing no parts
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Let me determine which of the eight possible relations could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x can be completely outside z while y is inside z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x can touch z's boundary at a point different from where y touches it.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x can overlap with parts of z that don't contain y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be inside z and touch z's boundary while being disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z without touching its boundary while still being disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were a part of x, then y would also be part of x (since y is part of z), contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Same reasoning as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be part of x, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
