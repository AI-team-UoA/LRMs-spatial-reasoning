PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We know that:
1. TPPi(x,y) - this means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained within x and touches x's boundary at some point.
2. NTPP(y,z) - this means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely contained within the interior of z without touching z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about the spatial configurations:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z) means y is inside z without touching z's boundary

So y is inside both x and z, but has different relationships with their boundaries.

Given that y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary, z must extend beyond y in all directions to keep y away from z's boundary.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: This is not possible because y is inside both x and z, so x and z must share at least the region occupied by y.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: This is not possible for the same reason - x and z must overlap because they both contain y.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: This is possible if x extends outside of z in some areas, and z extends outside of x in other areas, while they share the region containing y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary at some point.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is not possible. Since y is a non-tangential proper part of z, and y touches x's boundary, z must extend beyond y to keep y away from z's boundary. This would mean z extends to or beyond x's boundary in at least some places, so z cannot be properly contained within x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This is not possible for similar reasons as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This is not possible because y touches x's boundary but doesn't touch z's boundary, so x and z must have different boundaries.

Let me double-check by reasoning through specific scenarios:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Let's verify each potential relation:

For PO(x,z):
If x and z partially overlap, they can both contain y. Since y touches x's boundary but not z's, z must extend beyond x in the area where y touches x's boundary. At the same time, x could extend beyond z in other areas, making them partially overlapping.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is completely contained in z but touches z's boundary, this would still allow y to be inside both x and z, with y touching x's boundary but not z's.

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is completely contained in z without touching z's boundary, y can still be inside both and touch x's boundary while not touching z's.

Actually, let me reconsider TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):

For TPPi(x,z):
This means z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and y already touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), this could be possible if z exactly extends to the part of x's boundary that y touches, but no further. However, this seems to contradict NTPP(y,z) which requires y to not touch z's boundary. If z touches x's boundary at the same place y does, then y would also touch z's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,z).

For NTPPi(x,z):
This means z is properly contained in x without touching x's boundary. But since y touches x's boundary and is contained in z, z must extend to that boundary point, contradicting the definition of NTPPi.

So my analysis confirms that the possible relations are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think once more about TPPi(x,z):

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is contained in x and touches x's boundary.

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then y cannot touch x's boundary (because it would need to "go through" z's boundary first). But this contradicts TPPi(x,y) which says y does touch x's boundary.

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I need to verify NTPPi(x,z) as well:

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then y cannot touch x's boundary. But this contradicts TPPi(x,y) which says y does touch x's boundary.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible either.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Actually, I think I made an error in my earlier reasoning. Let me try a more careful approach.

We know:
1. TPPi(x,y) - which means TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary.

First, let's be clear about what these mean in terms of set relationships:
- TPP(y,x): y ⊂ x (proper subset) and y touches the boundary of x
- NTPP(y,z): y ⊂ z (proper subset) and y does not touch the boundary of z

Now, let's systematically check each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
   If x and z are disconnected, they share no points. But y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the points in y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is impossible.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   If x and z only touch at their boundaries without overlapping, then they don't share any interior points. But y is in the interior of both, so EC(x,z) is impossible.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   This means x and z share some points, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible if:
   - y is in the overlap region
   - y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary
   So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This means x ⊂ z and x touches z's boundary. This is possible if:
   - y is inside both x and z
   - y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary
   - x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary
   So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This means x ⊂ z and x does not touch z's boundary. This is possible if:
   - y is inside both x and z
   - y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary
   - x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary
   So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This means z ⊂ x and z touches x's boundary. Let's see:
   - y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z))
   - y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y))
   - If z touches x's boundary, and y is inside z but touches x's boundary, then y must also touch z's boundary
   But this contradicts NTPP(y,z), which says y doesn't touch z's boundary.
   So TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This means z ⊂ x and z does not touch x's boundary. Let's see:
   - y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z))
   - y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y))
   - If z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is inside z, then y cannot touch x's boundary
   But this contradicts TPPi(x,y), which says y does touch x's boundary.
   So NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   If x = z, then their boundaries are identical. But y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)) and doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), which is a contradiction if x = z.
   So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

I think I've been making an error in my reasoning about TPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider it:

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean:
- z is properly contained in x
- z touches x's boundary at least at one point

Now, we know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

If z is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary, and y is properly contained in z without touching z's boundary, then y must be "deeper" inside x than z's boundary. This means y cannot touch x's boundary, which contradicts TPPi(x,y).

So TPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

The same logic applies to NTPPi(x,z) - if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (being inside z) must be even further from x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

So my conclusion remains:
The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Let me actually create some simple diagrams to make sure:

For PO(x,z):
```
    +-------+
    |       |
+---|----+  |
|   |    |  |
|   +----+--+
|   y    |
|        |
+--------+
x        z
```

For TPP(x,z):
```
    +-------------+
    |             |
    | +-------+   |
    | |       |   |
    | |   +---+   |
    | |   |   |   |
    | |   +---+   |
    | |    y  |   |
    | +-------+   |
    |     x       |
    +-------------+
          z
```

For NTPP(x,z):
```
      +---------------+
      |               |
      |               |
      |   +-------+   |
      |   |       |   |
      |   |   +---+   |
      |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   +---+   |
      |   |    y  |   |
      |   +-------+   |
      |       x       |
      +---------------+
              z
```

These diagrams confirm that PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are all possible relations given TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Actually, I should double-check my understanding of TPPi to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly:

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(y,x), which means:
- y is a tangential proper part of x
- y is properly contained in x
- y touches x's boundary

And NTPP(y,z) means:
- y is a non-tangential proper part of z
- y is properly contained in z
- y does not touch z's boundary

Given these definitions, my analysis above is correct.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z) - partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is contained in z without touching z's boundary)

I'll check each possible RCC-8 relation systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected: Impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the region occupied by y.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected: Impossible for the same reason - x and z must overlap since they both contain y.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping: Possible if x extends outside of z in some areas while z extends outside of x in others, with y in the shared region.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: Possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: Impossible because y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)) while being inside z without touching z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)). If z touched x's boundary where y does, then y would touch z's boundary, contradicting NTPP(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: Impossible because if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y (inside z) couldn't touch x's boundary, contradicting TPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: Impossible because y touches x's boundary but not z's boundary, so x and z must have different boundaries.
