PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think about what the relations TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) mean.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y: x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary

Now I need to figure out what the possible relationships between x and z are, given this information.

Let's analyze the possibilities one by one:

1. DC(x,z) - are x and z disconnected?
   Both x and z are inside y, but they could be in different "parts" of y, not touching. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - do x and z touch at their boundaries?
   It's possible that x and z touch at their boundaries while both being inside y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - do x and z partially overlap?
   x and z could partially overlap while both being inside y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - is x a tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean that x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. Since both x and z are inside y, this is possible if z is a larger region inside y that contains x. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - is x a non-tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean that x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since both x and z are inside y, this is possible if z is a larger region inside y that fully contains x without x touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - is z a tangential proper part of x?
   This is the same as TPP(z,x), which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since both x and z are inside y, this is possible if x is a larger region inside y that contains z. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - is z a non-tangential proper part of x?
   This is the same as NTPP(z,x), which means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since both x and z are inside y, this is possible if x is a larger region inside y that fully contains z without z touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - are x and z equal?
   If x and z are the same region inside y, then they are equal. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I realize I need to be more careful here. The fact that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y means they both touch y's boundary. This doesn't constrain them in relation to each other as much as I initially thought.

Let me reconsider this:

TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So x and z are both parts of y and both touch y's boundary. Let's go through the possibilities again:

1. DC(x,z) - are x and z disconnected?
   Even though both x and z touch y's boundary, they could be on opposite sides of y and not touch each other. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - do x and z touch at their boundaries?
   x and z could touch at their boundaries while both being inside y and touching y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - do x and z partially overlap?
   x and z could partially overlap while both being inside y and touching y's boundary. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - is x a tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean that x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. This is possible if z is a larger region inside y that contains x, and x touches both z's boundary and y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - is x a non-tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean that x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But since x touches y's boundary and z is inside y, x would also have to touch z's boundary (the part where z touches y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - is z a tangential proper part of x?
   Similar to TPP(x,z), this is possible if x is a larger region inside y that contains z, and z touches both x's boundary and y's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - is z a non-tangential proper part of x?
   Similar to NTPP(x,z), this is not possible because z touches y's boundary, so it would also have to touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - are x and z equal?
   If x and z are the same region inside y, then they are equal. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I think I'm still not being careful enough. Let me reconsider the situation.

TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y: x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

But I should be more precise: TPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y (so x is fully inside y, but x ≠ y), and x touches y's boundary. Similarly, TPP(z,y) means that z is a proper part of y (so z is fully inside y, but z ≠ y), and z touches y's boundary.

Now, let me go through the possibilities again:

1. DC(x,z) - are x and z disconnected?
   Both x and z are inside y, but they could be in different "parts" of y, not touching. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - do x and z touch at their boundaries?
   It's possible that x and z touch at their boundaries while both being inside y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - do x and z partially overlap?
   x and z could partially overlap while both being inside y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - is x a tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean that x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary. Since both x and z are inside y, this is possible if z is a larger region inside y that contains x. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - is x a non-tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean that x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since both x and z are inside y, this is possible if z is a larger region inside y that fully contains x without x touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I'm contradicting myself from earlier. Let me reconsider the NTPP case carefully.

NTPP(x,z) would mean that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But TPP(x,y) means that x touches y's boundary. So if z is also a proper part of y, could x be inside z without touching z's boundary, while still touching y's boundary?

Let me visualize this: imagine y is a circle, and z is a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at one point. Now, x could be an even smaller circle inside z. If x touches y's boundary at the same point where z touches y, then x would also be touching z's boundary. This means that x can't be an NTPP of z.

But what if z touches y's boundary at multiple points, and x only touches y at a point where z doesn't? Then x would be inside z, touching y's boundary but not touching z's boundary. This seems possible.

Actually, that's wrong. If x touches y's boundary at a point, and x is inside z, then z must also touch y's boundary at that same point (or it wouldn't be inside z). So x would also be touching z's boundary.

Let me try a different approach. If x is inside z and touches y's boundary, then at the point where x touches y's boundary, z must also touch y's boundary (since z contains x). This means that x is touching z's boundary at that point. So x cannot be an NTPP of z; it must be a TPP.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's continue with the other cases:

6. TPPi(x,z) - is z a tangential proper part of x?
   This is the same as TPP(z,x), which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since both x and z are inside y, this is possible if x is a larger region inside y that contains z. But similar to the previous case, since z touches y's boundary, it would also touch x's boundary at that point. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - is z a non-tangential proper part of x?
   Similar to NTPP(x,z), this is not possible because z touches y's boundary, so it would also have to touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - are x and z equal?
   If x and z are the same region inside y, then they are equal. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by thinking step by step and ensuring I'm not making errors about what's possible or not. Let's revisit the original conditions:

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (x is fully inside y and x ≠ y)
- x touches y's boundary (tangential)

TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means:
- z is a proper part of y (z is fully inside y and z ≠ y)
- z touches y's boundary (tangential)

Now, let's see what the possible relationships between x and z could be:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not touching each other. Even though both touch y's boundary, they could touch different parts of the boundary.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, touching each other at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if x and z are regions within y that share some area, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is fully contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. Since x touches y's boundary, it must touch z's boundary at at least one of those points (where z also touches y's boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But TPP(x,y) means that x touches y's boundary. If x is inside z and touches y's boundary, then at the point where x touches y, z must also touch y (since z contains x). But that means x is touching z's boundary at that point. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is the same as TPP(z,x), which means z is fully contained within x, and z touches x's boundary. Since z touches y's boundary, it must touch x's boundary at at least one of those points (where x also touches y's boundary).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to NTPP(x,z), this is not possible because z touches y's boundary, which means it would also touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This is possible if x and z are the same region within y.

So the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider the case of NTPP(x,z) one more time. I'm imagining a situation where y is a circle, z is a smaller circle inside y touching y's boundary at a point A, and x is an even smaller circle inside z touching y's boundary at the same point A. In this scenario, x would also touch z's boundary at point A. So x would be a TPP of z, not an NTPP.

Let me reconsider the case of NTPP(x,z) by visualizing:

- y is a large circle
- z is a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at a point A
- x is an even smaller circle inside z

For x to be a TPP of y, it must touch y's boundary. Let's say it touches y's boundary at a point B. Since x is inside z, z must also touch y's boundary at point B. But then, x would be touching z's boundary at point B. This means x cannot be an NTPP of z.

So NTPP(x,z) is not possible, and similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me list the final set of possible relationships: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, let's just do a basic check to make sure I'm not missing something obvious. Given the definitions, we can at least exclude the NTPP cases by logic:

1. TPP(x,y) means x touches y's boundary.
2. TPP(z,y) means z touches y's boundary.
3. If NTPP(x,z), then x doesn't touch z's boundary.
4. But if x touches y's boundary and x is inside z, then x must touch z's boundary at the point where x touches y's boundary.
5. This contradicts NTPP(x,z), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

The same logic applies to NTPPi(x,z).

So the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, I'm not being careful enough. Let's break this down step by step.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (x is fully inside y and x ≠ y)
- x touches y's boundary

TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means:
- z is a proper part of y (z is fully inside y and z ≠ y)
- z touches y's boundary

I need to determine what the possible relationships between x and z are.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not touching each other.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, touching each other at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if x and z are regions within y that share some area, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean that x is fully contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. Is this possible? Yes, because x could be a smaller region within z, and x could touch both z's boundary and y's boundary at the same point.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Is this possible? If x touches y's boundary, and x is inside z, then at the point where x touches y, z must also touch y (since z contains x). But that means x is touching z's boundary at that point. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I've been too hasty in my conclusion. Let me visualize a more complex scenario:

- y is a large square
- z is a U-shaped region inside y, with the open part of the U touching y's boundary
- x is a small square inside the U but not touching the U's boundary, except at the point where both x and the U touch y's boundary

In this scenario, x is inside z, x touches y's boundary, and x touches z's boundary only at the point where both touch y's boundary. Is this a case of NTPP(x,z)? No, because x still touches z's boundary, so it's a TPP(x,z).

Let me try another visualization:

- y is a large square
- z is a smaller square inside y, touching y's boundary at a point A
- x is an even smaller square inside z, touching y's boundary at point A

In this scenario, x is inside z, and x touches y's boundary at the same point where z touches y's boundary. But this means x is also touching z's boundary at point A. So this is a case of TPP(x,z), not NTPP(x,z).

I think my conclusion stands: NTPP(x,z) is not possible, and by the same logic, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Let me try one more complex visualization to check:

- y is a large square
- z is a C-shaped region inside y, with the open part of the C touching y's boundary
- x is a small square inside the C, touching y's boundary at a point B, which is different from where the C touches y

This would still be a case of TPP(x,z), not NTPP(x,z), because x touches z's boundary at point B.

What about a scenario where x touches y's boundary at multiple points?

- y is a large square
- z is a smaller square inside y, touching y's boundary at a point A
- x is a curved L-shaped region inside z, touching y's boundary at points A and B

In this case, x touches y's boundary at point A, where z also touches y's boundary, and at point B, where z doesn't touch y's boundary. But this isn't possible, because if x is inside z and touches y's boundary at point B, then z must also touch y's boundary at point B (or x wouldn't be inside z).

Actually, this shows that when TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y), it's not possible for one to be an NTPP of the other.

So the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Let me double-check by considering the definitions again.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is a proper part of y (fully inside y, x ≠ y) and x touches y's boundary.
TPP(z,y) means z is a tangential proper part of y: z is a proper part of y (fully inside y, z ≠ y) and z touches y's boundary.

Let's think about NTPP(x,z) one more time. This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z: x is a proper part of z (fully inside z, x ≠ z) and x does not touch z's boundary.

If x is fully inside z and x touches y's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary at the same point (since z contains x). But then x would be touching z's boundary at that point, which contradicts NTPP(x,z).

So NTPP(x,z) is not possible, and by the same logic, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Let me now check the possibility of TPPi(x,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,x)) to make sure I've been clear.

TPP(z,x) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x: z is a proper part of x (fully inside x, z ≠ x) and z touches x's boundary.

Is this possible? Yes, if x is a larger region inside y and z is a smaller region inside x, and both x and z touch y's boundary at the same point. Then z would touch x's boundary at that point.

Actually, I've gone back and forth too much. Let me approach this more clearly. When TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y), the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not touching each other.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, touching each other at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if x and z are regions within y that share some area, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is fully contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. Since x touches y's boundary and x is inside z, x must touch z's boundary at at least one of the points where x touches y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and x is inside z, then x must touch z's boundary at at least one of the points where x touches y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is the same as TPP(z,x), which means z is fully contained within x, and z touches x's boundary. Since z touches y's boundary and z is inside x, z must touch x's boundary at at least one of the points where z touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean that z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But if z touches y's boundary, and z is inside x, then z must touch x's boundary at at least one of the points where z touches y's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This is possible if x and z are the same region within y.

So the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Therefore, when TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

I think I have answered the question to the best of my abilities. My final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think I've been making a mistake. TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which means it's the same as TPP(z,y). So the problem statement TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. Let me start again.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is a proper part of y (fully inside y, x ≠ y) and x touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of z: y is a proper part of z (fully inside z, y ≠ z) and y touches z's boundary.

So we have:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

This gives us a nested structure: x is inside y, which is inside z. Now let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x is inside z. They cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.
   This is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x is inside z. They are not just touching.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x is fully inside z. They are not just partially overlapping.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean that x is fully contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. This is possible if x touches z's boundary at the point where y touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary at the point where y touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean that z is fully contained within x, which is not possible since x is inside y, which is inside z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean that z is fully inside x, which is not possible since x is inside y, which is inside z. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x cannot be equal to z.

So the possible relationships are: TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me think more carefully. If y is inside z, and x is inside y, then x must be inside z. But the question is whether x touches z's boundary or not.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, making it a TPP(x,z).

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary, or if x doesn't touch y's boundary at all, then x wouldn't touch z's boundary, making it an NTPP(x,z).

So the possible relationships are indeed: TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm not sure if I've been interpreting the problem statement correctly. Let me clarify again what TPPi(y,z) means.

TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which means that z is a tangential proper part of y, not that y is a tangential proper part of z as I previously thought. So TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y).

So the problem statement gives us:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is a proper part of y (fully inside y, x ≠ y) and x touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y: z is a proper part of y (fully inside y, z ≠ y) and z touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary

This is the scenario I was considering initially, where both x and z are inside y. Let me redo the analysis to be sure.

Now let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not touching each other.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, touching each other at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if x and z are regions within y that share some area, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is fully contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. Since x touches y's boundary and x is inside z, x must touch z's boundary at at least one of the points where x touches y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and x is inside z, then x must touch z's boundary at at least one of the points where x touches y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is the same as TPP(z,x), which means z is fully contained within x, and z touches x's boundary. Since z touches y's boundary and z is inside x, z must touch x's boundary at at least one of the points where z touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean that z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But if z touches y's boundary, and z is inside x, then z must touch x's boundary at at least one of the points where z touches y's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This is possible if x and z are the same region within y.

So the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, I'm still not sure if my interpretation of TPPi(y,z) was correct. Let me make sure.

In RCC-8, TPP(a,b) means "a is a tangential proper part of b", and TPPi(a,b) means "b is a tangential proper part of a", which is the same as TPP(b,a).

So the problem statement gives us:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, which is the same as TPP(y,z).

This doesn't seem right. If TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, then it should be written as TPP(z,y), not TPPi(y,z).

Actually, I think my original interpretation was correct. TPPi(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, which is the same as TPP(y,z).

So the problem statement gives us:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

So we have:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

This gives us a nested structure: x is inside y, which is inside z. Now let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x is inside z. They cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.
   This is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x is inside z. They are not just touching.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x is fully inside z. They are not just partially overlapping.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean that x is fully contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. This is possible if x touches z's boundary at the point where y touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary at the point where y touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean that z is fully contained within x, which is not possible since x is inside y, which is inside z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean that z is fully inside x, which is not possible since x is inside y, which is inside z. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x cannot be equal to z.

So the possible relationships are: TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Okay, so I think the correct understanding of the problem is:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z: y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So we have a nested structure: x is inside y, which is inside z. And the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

TPP(x,z) is possible if x touches z's boundary at the point where y touches z's boundary.
NTPP(x,z) is possible if x doesn't touch z's boundary at all.

So the answer is: TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Ok, let me verify the meaning of TPP and TPPi again.

TPP(a,b) means "a is a tangential proper part of b", which means a is fully inside b, a ≠ b, and a touches b's boundary.
TPPi(a,b) means "b is a tangential proper part of a", which is the same as TPP(b,a), meaning b is fully inside a, a ≠ b, and b touches a's boundary.

So the problem statement gives us:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, which is the same as TPP(z,y).

So we have:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

This means both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary. This is not a nested structure; x and z are "siblings" inside y.

Now let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, not touching each other.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.
   This is possible if x and z are separate regions within y, touching each other at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if x and z are regions within y that share some area, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if x is fully contained within z, and x touches z's boundary. Since x touches y's boundary and x is inside z, x must touch z's boundary at at least one of the points where x touches y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This would mean that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and x is inside z, then x must touch z's boundary at at least one of the points where x touches y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is the same as TPP(z,x), which means z is fully contained within x, and z touches x's boundary. Since z touches y's boundary and z is inside x, z must touch x's boundary at at least one of the points where z touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean that z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But if z touches y's boundary, and z is inside x, then z must touch x's boundary at at least one of the points where z touches y's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This is possible if x and z are the same region within y.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

But I'm still not 100% sure about the interpretation of TPPi(y,z). Let me verify it once more.

In RCC-8, if a and b are regions, then:
- TPP(a,b) means "a is a tangential proper part of b"
- TPPi(a,b) means "a contains b as a tangential proper part", which is the same as TPP(b,a)

So:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z) means y contains z as a tangential proper part, which is the same as TPP(z,y).

Wait, this contradicts my previous interpretation. Let me double-check.

Actually, I think my interpretation was wrong. The "i" in TPPi stands for "inverse", meaning it's the inverse of TPP. So TPPi(a,b) means that a is not a tangential proper part of b, but rather b is a tangential proper part of a. So TPPi(a,b) = TPP(b,a).

Therefore, TPPi(y,z) means that y is not a tangential proper part of z, but rather z is a tangential proper part of y. This is the same as TPP(z,y).

So the problem statement gives us:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, which is the same as TPP(z,y).

So we have:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

This means both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary. They are "siblings" inside y.

Given this, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

And for the reasons I explained earlier, NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Let's triple-check this: We have TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), which is the same as TPP(z,y). This means x is a tangential proper part of y, and z is a tangential proper part of y. Both x and z are inside y and touch y's boundary. With this configuration, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

NTPP(x,z) is not possible because if x touches y's boundary and x is inside z, then x must touch z's boundary at at least one of the points where x touches y's boundary. Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, wait one second. Let me ensure that my reasoning is consistent by visualizing a case for each of these possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   Visualization: x and z are two separate circles inside y, and both touch y's boundary, but they don't touch each other.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but do not overlap.
   Visualization: x and z are two circles inside y that touch each other at a point, and both touch y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   Visualization: x and z are two circles inside y that overlap, but neither is fully inside the other, and both touch y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Visualization: z is a larger circle inside y, and x is a smaller circle inside z. Both touch y's boundary at the same point, which means x also touches z's boundary at that point.

5. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Visualization: x is a larger circle inside y, and z is a smaller circle inside x. Both touch y's boundary at the same point, which means z also touches x's boundary at that point.

6. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   Visualization: x and z are the same circle inside y, touching y's boundary.

For 5, NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z, we would need a visualization where x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary (as per TPP(x,y)), and x is inside z, then x must touch z's boundary at the point where x touches y's boundary. So this isn't possible.

Similarly, for 7, NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x, if z touches y's boundary (as per TPP(z,y)), and z is inside x, then z must touch x's boundary at the point where z touches y's boundary. So this isn't possible either.

So the possible relationships are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

I'm feeling very confident about this conclusion. The key insight is that when both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, both touching y's boundary, then if one is a proper part of the other, it must be a tangential proper part, not a non-tangential proper part.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between regions x and z, given that TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let's understand what these relations mean:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is inside y and touches y's boundary
- TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which means z is a tangential proper part of y (equivalent to TPP(z,y))

So we have:
- x is inside y and touches y's boundary
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary

Now I'll analyze all possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected regions within y
2. EC(x,z): x and z can externally connect (touch at their boundaries) within y
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap within y
4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z
5. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x
6. EQ(x,z): x and z can be equal

Note that NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible because if either region is inside the other and both touch y's boundary, then they must also touch each other's boundary at those points.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
