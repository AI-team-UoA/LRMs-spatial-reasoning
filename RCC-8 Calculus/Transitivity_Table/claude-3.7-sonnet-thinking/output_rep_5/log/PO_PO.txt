PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine all possible relationships between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let's recall the meaning of PO:
PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

So we have:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- PO(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Now I need to determine what relationship can hold between x and z. Let's go through each of the 8 relations and check if it's possible:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
Is this possible? Yes, x and z could be disconnected even though they both partially overlap with y. Imagine y as a bridge connecting two disconnected regions x and z.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary:
Is this possible? Yes, x and z could touch at a boundary while both partially overlapping with y.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
Is this possible? Yes, x and z could partially overlap directly.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
Is this possible? Yes, x could be a tangential proper part of z while both partially overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
Is this possible? Yes, x could be entirely contained within z (without touching its boundary) while both partially overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z) = TPP(z,x) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
Is this possible? Yes, z could be a tangential proper part of x while both partially overlap with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) = NTPP(z,x) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
Is this possible? Yes, z could be entirely contained within x (without touching its boundary) while both partially overlap with y.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
Is this possible? Yes, x and z could be the same region while both partially overlap with y.

All 8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). The answer is all possible relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Let me double-check this by constructing specific examples for each case:

For DC(x,z): 
Imagine y as a dumbbell shape, with x overlapping the left bell and z overlapping the right bell, but x and z not touching.

For EC(x,z):
Imagine y as a dumbbell shape, with x overlapping the left bell and extending leftward, and z overlapping the right bell and extending rightward. x and z just touch at a point in the middle.

For PO(x,z):
Imagine y as a central region, with x overlapping the left part of y and extending leftward, and z overlapping the right part of y and extending rightward. x and z overlap in a small central portion.

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a large region, y overlapping with part of z, and x as a smaller region inside z that also overlaps with y. x touches the boundary of z.

For NTPP(x,z):
Similar to TPP, but x is completely inside z without touching its boundary.

For TPPi(x,z):
The reverse of TPP - x is a large region, y overlaps with part of x, and z is a smaller region inside x that also overlaps with y. z touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z):
The reverse of NTPP - z is completely inside x without touching its boundary.

For EQ(x,z):
x and z are the same region, and y partially overlaps with both.

So all 8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). The answer is: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Hmm, but I should make sure I haven't made a mistake. Let me try to think about this more systematically.

When we have PO(x,y), it means:
- x and y share some interior points
- x has some points not in y
- y has some points not in x

Similarly, for PO(y,z):
- y and z share some interior points
- y has some points not in z
- z has some points not in y

Now, let's consider what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

The shared part between x and y could be completely different from the shared part between y and z. In that case, x and z might not share any points, allowing for DC or EC.

Alternatively, there might be some overlap between the shared parts, which would make PO possible.

It's also possible that x could be contained within z (TPP or NTPP) or vice versa (TPPi or NTPPi).

And finally, x and z could be identical (EQ).

So all 8 relations seem possible. Let me try to draw some examples to confirm:

For DC(x,z):
x: [-----]
y:    [-----]
z:       [-----]
Here, x and y share a part, y and z share a part, but x and z are disconnected.

For EC(x,z):
x: [-----]
y:    [-----]
z:     [-----]
Here, x and y share a part, y and z share a part, and x and z just touch at a point.

For PO(x,z):
x: [-----]
y:    [-----]
z:   [-----]
Here, x and y share a part, y and z share a part, and x and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z):
x:   [---]
y:  [-----]
z: [-------]
Here, x is a tangential proper part of z, and both partially overlap with y.

For NTPP(x,z):
x:    [--]
y:  [-----]
z: [-------]
Here, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and both partially overlap with y.

For TPPi(x,z):
x: [-------]
y:  [-----]
z:   [---]
Here, z is a tangential proper part of x, and both partially overlap with y.

For NTPPi(x,z):
x: [-------]
y:  [-----]
z:    [--]
Here, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and both partially overlap with y.

For EQ(x,z):
x: [-----]
y:  [---]
z: [-----]
Here, x and z are identical, and both partially overlap with y.

Wait, I'm not sure if my one-dimensional representations are accurate for showing all the nuances of these relationships. Let me think more carefully, especially about the cases of TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be a proper part of z (so all of x is inside z) and x touches the boundary of z. But we also need both x and z to partially overlap with y. This seems possible: imagine z as a large circle, x as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary, and y as another circle that partially overlaps with both x and z.

For NTPP(x,z), it's similar, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

For TPPi(x,z), it's the reverse: z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.

Yes, all of these scenarios seem possible.

Let me consider EQ(x,z) again. If x and z are identical, and we know that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), then we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,x). This seems consistent.

So, my conclusion is that all 8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me take another approach to be sure. PO is symmetric, so PO(x,y) is the same as PO(y,x). So we have PO(y,x) and PO(y,z). This means y partially overlaps with both x and z. Let's consider the different possibilities:

1. The part of y that overlaps with x could be completely different from the part of y that overlaps with z. In this case, x and z don't share any points, so they could be DC (disconnected) or EC (externally connected).

2. The part of y that overlaps with x could partially overlap with the part of y that overlaps with z. In this case, x and z share some points but not all, so they could be PO (partially overlapping).

3. The part of y that overlaps with x could be a proper part of the part of y that overlaps with z. In this case, x could be a proper part of z, so they could be TPP (tangential proper part) or NTPP (non-tangential proper part).

4. The part of y that overlaps with z could be a proper part of the part of y that overlaps with x. In this case, z could be a proper part of x, so they could be TPPi or NTPPi.

5. The part of y that overlaps with x could be identical to the part of y that overlaps with z. In this case, x and z could be identical, so they could be EQ.

So all 8 relations seem possible.

Let me double-check with a third approach using set theory, since these spatial relations can be represented in terms of set operations.

Let X, Y, and Z be the sets corresponding to the regions x, y, and z.

PO(x,y) means:
- X ∩ Y ≠ ∅ (they share some points)
- X \ Y ≠ ∅ (x has some points not in y)
- Y \ X ≠ ∅ (y has some points not in x)

Similarly, PO(y,z) means:
- Y ∩ Z ≠ ∅
- Y \ Z ≠ ∅
- Z \ Y ≠ ∅

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relationship between X and Z:

1. DC(x,z) means X ∩ Z = ∅. 
   Is this possible? Yes, we know Y ∩ X ≠ ∅ and Y ∩ Z ≠ ∅, but this doesn't imply X ∩ Z ≠ ∅. For example, if Y = {1, 2, 3}, X = {1}, and Z = {3}, then Y ∩ X = {1}, Y ∩ Z = {3}, but X ∩ Z = ∅.

2. EC(x,z) means X and Z share boundary points but not interior points.
   This is a bit harder to represent in pure set theory, but it's plausible that this could happen given the constraints.

3. PO(x,z) means X ∩ Z ≠ ∅, X \ Z ≠ ∅, and Z \ X ≠ ∅.
   This is clearly possible. For example, if Y = {1, 2, 3}, X = {1, 2, 4}, and Z = {2, 3, 5}, then PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and also PO(x,z) holds.

4. TPP(x,z) means X ⊂ Z and X shares boundary points with Z.
   This is possible. For example, if Y partially overlaps with both X and Z, and X is a proper subset of Z that touches Z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) means X ⊂ Z and X doesn't share boundary points with Z.
   This is also possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) means Z ⊂ X and Z shares boundary points with X.
   This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) means Z ⊂ X and Z doesn't share boundary points with X.
   This is also possible.

8. EQ(x,z) means X = Z.
   This is possible. For example, if Y = {1, 2, 3} and X = Z = {2, 3, 4}, then PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) hold, and also EQ(x,z) holds.

So, from a set theory perspective, all 8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are:
DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me think once more about the EQ(x,z) case. If EQ(x,z), then x and z are identical. This means that any relation that holds between y and x also holds between y and z. We know that PO(y,x) holds (which is the same as PO(x,y)), so we must also have PO(y,z). This is consistent with our given information. So EQ(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

So, the final answer is that all 8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z): DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Recall that PO(x,y) means:
- x and y share some interior points
- x has some points not in y
- y has some points not in x

Similarly for PO(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. The overlapping regions of x with y and z with y can be completely separate parts of y.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. The regions can be arranged so x and z just touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. The overlapping parts with y can partially coincide, creating partial overlap between x and z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be properly contained in z while touching z's boundary, and both partially overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be properly contained in z without touching z's boundary, while both partially overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be properly contained in x while touching x's boundary, and both partially overlap with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary, while both partially overlap with y.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. x and z can be identical while both partially overlap with y.
