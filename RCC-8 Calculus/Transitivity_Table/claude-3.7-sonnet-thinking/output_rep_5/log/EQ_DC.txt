PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z).

First, let's understand what these given relations mean:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same space.
- DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected, i.e., they don't share any part and don't even touch.

Since x and y are exactly the same spatial region (EQ(x,y)), and y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), then x must also be disconnected from z.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

To double-check: Could there be any other relation between x and z?
- EC(x,z) would mean x and z touch at a boundary, but y and z don't touch (as per DC(y,z)), so x and z can't touch either.
- PO(x,z) would mean x and z share some interior parts, but y and z don't share any parts (as per DC(y,z)), so x and z can't share any parts either.
- TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, which is impossible since x is equivalent to y, and y is disconnected from z.
- NTPP(x,z) would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which is also impossible for the same reason as TPP.
- TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a proper part of x, which is impossible since x is equivalent to y, and y is disconnected from z.
- EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are coincident, which is impossible since x is equivalent to y, and y is disconnected from z.

So the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relation must hold between x and z given the constraints.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (share no parts and don't touch)

Since x and y are exactly the same spatial region (EQ(x,y)), and y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), then x must also be disconnected from z.

No other relation could possibly hold between x and z given these constraints, because x is identical to y in spatial terms, so x must have the same relationship with z that y has.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
