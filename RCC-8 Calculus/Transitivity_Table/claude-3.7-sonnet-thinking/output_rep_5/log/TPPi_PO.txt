PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this step by step:

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): This means that y and z partially overlap - they share some part, but neither is contained in the other.

I need to determine what relation can hold between x and z. Let's think about the constraints:

1. Since y is contained in x (from TPPi(x,y)), and y overlaps with z (from PO(y,z)), then x and z must share at least some part (the part that y and z share).

2. But this doesn't fully constrain the relation between x and z. Let's consider the possibilities:

a) DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because we already established that x and z must share some part (through y).

b) EC(x,z): This means x and z only touch at their boundaries. This is also impossible because x and z must share some interior part (the part of y that overlaps with z).

c) PO(x,z): This is possible. x could partially overlap with z, sharing the part where y and z overlap, but having parts that are outside of z, and z having parts outside of x.

d) TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This seems unlikely because y is already a tangential proper part of x, and y partially overlaps with z. For x to be contained in z would require specific configurations.

e) NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This seems even less likely for the same reasons as TPP.

f) TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is mostly contained within y, but touches the boundary of y where y touches the boundary of x.

g) NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within y.

h) EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This seems unlikely given the other constraints.

Let me think more carefully about each case:

For TPP(x,z) to hold: This would mean x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. But since y is already a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)), and y partially overlaps with z, this would mean y is contained partly in z and partly outside z, which contradicts the definition of PO(y,z).

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let's reconsider:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x.
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap.

For DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then no part of x overlaps with z. But since y is a part of x and y overlaps with z, this would mean some part of x overlaps with z, contradicting DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is impossible.

For EC(x,z): If x and z only touch at their boundaries, then no part of x overlaps with the interior of z. But since y is a part of x and y overlaps with z, this would mean some part of x overlaps with the interior of z, contradicting EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is impossible.

For PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z can partially overlap, with x having parts outside of z and z having parts outside of x.

For TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. Since y is a proper part of x, y must also be a proper part of z. But PO(y,z) says that y and z partially overlap, which means y has parts outside of z. This contradicts TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is impossible.

For NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, since y is a proper part of x, y must also be a proper part of z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is impossible.

For TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is mostly contained within x, but touches x's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely contained within the interior of x.

For EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since y is a proper part of x and y partially overlaps with z, this would mean y is a proper part of z and partially overlaps with z, which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Actually, I need to be even more careful. Let's think about each of these relations more rigorously:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is inside x, and they share a boundary point.
PO(y,z) means that y and z share a part, but neither is a part of the other. So some of y is inside z, and some of y is outside z.

For DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then there is no overlap between x and z. However, since part of y is inside z, and all of y is inside x, then part of x must be inside z, meaning there is an overlap. This contradicts DC(x,z). So DC(x,z) is impossible.

For EC(x,z): If x and z are externally connected, then they only share a boundary point. However, since part of y is inside z, and all of y is inside x, then part of x must be inside z, meaning there is an overlap. This contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is impossible.

For PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share a part, but neither is a part of the other. Since part of y is inside z, and all of y is inside x, then part of x is inside z. But also, since part of y is outside z, and all of y is inside x, then part of x is outside z. And since PO(y,z) implies that part of z is outside y, and y is inside x, it's possible that part of z is outside x as well. This is consistent with PO(x,z). So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. Since y is a tangential proper part of x, and part of y is outside z (from PO(y,z)), then part of x must be outside z. This contradicts TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is impossible.

For NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Using the same logic as for TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z) is also impossible.

For TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Since part of z is outside y (from PO(y,z)), it's possible that z could be completely inside x but touch x's boundary. This is consistent with TPPi(x,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. It's possible that z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. Since y is a tangential proper part of x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y must be a tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts PO(y,z). So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Hmm, I think we need to be more precise about the spatial configurations. Let me approach this another way.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x.
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap, with each having parts outside the other.

Now, let's consider the relationship between x and z in these cases:

1. There must be some overlap between x and z. This is because y overlaps with z, and y is inside x. So the possible relations are: PO, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

2. Can x be equal to z? If x equals z, then y would be a tangential proper part of z. But y partially overlaps with z, which means y has parts outside of z. This is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

3. Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z))? This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is positioned such that it touches the boundary of x where y touches the boundary of x.

4. Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z))? This would mean z is entirely inside the interior of x. This is possible if z is positioned such that it's entirely within the interior of x.

5. Can x and z partially overlap (PO(x,z))? This would mean some of x is inside z, and some of x is outside z; and some of z is inside x, and some of z is outside x. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, some of x is inside z. If z extends beyond the boundary of x, then some of z is outside x. This configuration is possible.

So, based on this more careful analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPPi, or NTPPi.

Oh wait, let's double-check TPPi(x,z). If z is a tangential proper part of x, this means all of z is inside x, and z touches the boundary of x. So if part of y overlaps with z, then that part is inside both x and z. It's also possible for part of y to be inside x but outside z. And it's possible for part of z to be outside y (from PO(y,z)). This configuration is consistent with the given information.

Let's double-check NTPPi(x,z). If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, this means all of z is inside the interior of x. So, again, part of y can overlap with z, part of y can be inside x but outside z, and part of z can be outside y. This is also consistent.

I need to check if there are other possibilities. Since we've ruled out EQ, TPP, NTPP, EC, and DC, the only other possibility is PO(x,z).

For PO(x,z): This would mean some of x is inside z, and some of x is outside z; and some of z is inside x, and some of z is outside x. We know that part of x is inside z (because y is inside x and y overlaps with z). If part of x is outside z, and part of z is outside x, then PO(x,z) holds. 

Actually, I'm not sure if there's a way to guarantee that part of z is outside x in the general case. Let's check.

If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y shares a part with z, it's possible that z extends beyond the boundary of x, in which case part of z is outside x. But it's also possible that z is entirely contained within x, in which case TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPPi, or NTPPi.

Hmm, let me make sure I haven't missed anything. I think I should think a bit more systematically here.

Given:
TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary).
PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share a part, but neither is a part of the other).

Let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z.

First, y and z share some region (from PO(y,z)). Call this shared region S.
Since y is entirely inside x (from TPPi(x,y)), S is also inside x.
This means x and z share at least S, so they cannot be DC or EC.

Next, I'll consider if x can be part of z:
If x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x).
But this contradicts PO(y,z), which says part of y is outside z.
So, x cannot be TPP or NTPP of z.

Now, let's consider if z can be part of x:
If z is inside x, it's possible. This would be TPPi(x,z) if z touches x's boundary, or NTPPi(x,z) if z is entirely within the interior of x.

Lastly, can x and z partially overlap?
This would mean some of x is inside z, and some of x is outside z; and some of z is inside x, and some of z is outside x.
Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, some of x is inside z.
And since PO(y,z) implies part of y is outside z, and y is inside x, part of x is outside z.
The question is: can part of z be outside x?
If z extends beyond the boundary of x, then part of z is outside x, and PO(x,z) holds.

But there's no guarantee from the given information that z must extend beyond x. So, it's possible that all of z is inside x, which would be TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

And if x and z are the same region, then y would be a proper part of z, contradicting PO(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I'm missing a detail. We know TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), but there are other constraints on how y and z relate.

From PO(y,z), we know that y and z overlap, and neither is a subset of the other. This means there's a part of y outside z, and a part of z outside y.

Since all of y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)), the part of z that's outside y could be either inside x or outside x.

If all of the part of z that's outside y is inside x, then all of z is inside x, which would be TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

If some of the part of z that's outside y is also outside x, then part of z is outside x, which means PO(x,z).

So, PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are all possible, depending on the specific configuration of x, y, and z. I don't think there are any other possible relations.

Let me double-check one more time:

Given:
TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): Possible if part of z extends beyond the boundary of x.
- TPPi(x,z): Possible if all of z is inside x and z touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): Possible if all of z is inside x and z does not touch the boundary of x.

All other relations are impossible.

Actually, I'm forgetting to consider the issue of touching. Let me verify if z can be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)).

For TPPi(x,z), z must touch the boundary of x. Given that y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), there's a point on the boundary of x that is in y. For z to also touch the boundary of x, either z includes that point, or z touches the boundary of x at a different point.

If z includes that boundary point and that boundary point is in the overlap between y and z (from PO(y,z)), then z touches the boundary of x. Alternatively, if the part of z outside y touches the boundary of x at a different point, then z touches the boundary of x.

This confirms that TPPi(x,z) is possible. Whether z touches the boundary of x or not depends on the specific configuration, so NTPPi(x,z) is also possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check the definition of PO to make sure I'm interpreting this properly. 

PO(y,z) means y and z share a part, but neither is a part of the other. This means there's a part of y inside z, a part of y outside z, a part of z inside y, and a part of z outside y.

Given TPPi(x,y) (y is a tangential proper part of x), all of y is inside x. So, the part of z that overlaps with y is inside x. The part of z that's outside y could be either inside or outside x, leading to TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or PO(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Let me verify this once more using a 2D spatial analogy:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a smaller shape entirely within x, touching x's boundary at one or more points.
- PO(y,z): y and z are two shapes that overlap, but neither is entirely inside the other.

Scenario 1: z is entirely inside x, and touches x's boundary at one or more points. This is TPPi(x,z).
Scenario 2: z is entirely inside x, but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z).
Scenario 3: Part of z is inside x, and part of z is outside x. This is PO(x,z).

All of these scenarios are consistent with the given information: TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z). So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

So, I'll go with:

The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what's possible when TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) are true.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (meaning y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some parts, but neither is contained within the other)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, x and z must share some region. This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

2. Since y is inside x but overlaps with z (meaning part of y is outside z), part of x must be outside z. This rules out TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

3. The remaining possibilities are:
   - PO(x,z): Part of z extends beyond x's boundary
   - TPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary
   - NTPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
