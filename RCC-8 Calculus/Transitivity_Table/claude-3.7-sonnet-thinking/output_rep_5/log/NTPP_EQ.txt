PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

I need to determine what relation holds between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same region, any relation that x has with y should also hold with z. In other words, if x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is equal to z, then x should also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

So the relation between x and z should be NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:
- x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
- y is coincident with z.
- Therefore, x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Yes, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z based on the given information.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since y and z occupy exactly the same space (EQ(y,z)), they have identical boundaries and interiors. If x is a non-tangential proper part of y, then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
