PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the relations NTPPi correctly:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's deduce the possible relationships between x and z:

Since z is completely inside y (NTPPi(y,z)), and y is completely inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), it follows that z is also completely inside x. Furthermore, z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, so z is separated from x's boundary by at least the distance between y's boundary and x's boundary. Thus, z is definitely not touching x's boundary.

Given that z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, the relationship between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z).

However, let me double-check this. NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. z is a proper part of x (i.e., z is completely inside x and z is not equal to x).
2. z does not touch x's boundary.

From our reasoning above, both of these conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me make sure I got the definition of NTPPi correct.

NTPPi(x,y) means that x is the inverse of NTPP(y,x). And NTPP(y,x) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, NTPPi(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. But I said earlier that NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me double-check: 
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, with the correct understanding:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Ok, now I think I was right before. Let's continue.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Therefore, z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x. This means z is completely inside x, and furthermore, z is separated from x's boundary by at least the distance between y and x's boundary. 

The relationship between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just make sure again. I think I might have been confused about the relation.

Here are the definitions:
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse, which means NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Therefore, z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x. This means z is completely inside x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary.

The relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I should think if any other relations are possible. 

Let me go through each of the RCC-8 relations and check if they could possibly hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because z is inside y, which is inside x, so z is inside x.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is not possible because z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, so z can't touch x's boundary.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is not possible because z is completely inside x, not just partially.
4. TPP(x,z): z contains x and x touches z's boundary. This is not possible because x contains z, not the other way around.
5. NTPP(x,z): z contains x and x doesn't touch z's boundary. This is not possible because x contains z, not the other way around.
6. TPPi(x,z): x contains z and z touches x's boundary. This is not possible because z doesn't touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): x contains z and z doesn't touch x's boundary. This is the relation we've determined holds between x and z.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is not possible because z is inside y, which is inside x, so z is inside x, not equal to it.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realized I'm using a slightly informal definition of "inside". Let me be more precise.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and x is not connected to the complement of y. NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse, meaning that y is a proper part of x and y is not connected to the complement of x.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and y is not connected to the complement of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and z is not connected to the complement of y.

If z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, then z is also a proper part of x.

Also, if z is not connected to the complement of y, and y is not connected to the complement of x, then z is not connected to the complement of x. 

To see this, suppose for contradiction that z is connected to the complement of x. Then, since z is entirely within y, y would also be connected to the complement of x, which contradicts our given condition. Therefore, z is not connected to the complement of x.

Hence, z is a proper part of x and z is not connected to the complement of x, which means NTPPi(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I've been going back and forth on the definition of NTPPi. Let me check once more:

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Therefore, z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. This means z is a proper part of x. Furthermore, since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z doesn't touch x's boundary.

Thus, z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which means NTPPi(x,z).

I'm pretty confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me be even more careful here. Let's use the original definitions in the RCC-8 calculus.

In the RCC-8 calculus, we consider regions in a topological space. The basic relation is "connected", and from this, other relations like "part of" are defined.

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y (i.e., every part of x is also a part of y, but not every part of y is a part of x), and x is not externally connected to the complement of y (i.e., x does not touch the boundary of y).
- NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), which means NTPP(y,x). In other words, y is a proper part of x, and y is not externally connected to the complement of x (i.e., y does not touch the boundary of x).

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x, and y does not touch the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Transitivity of "proper part": If z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, then z is a proper part of x.

Now, we need to show that z does not touch the boundary of x. 

Let's use a proof by contradiction: Suppose z does touch the boundary of x. Since z is completely within y, and y is completely within x, for z to touch the boundary of x, y would also have to touch the boundary of x. But this contradicts our given condition that y does not touch the boundary of x. Therefore, z does not touch the boundary of x.

Thus, z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I realized that I may have been using a different intuition for these relations. Let me check the formal definitions:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they have no points in common).
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but have no common interior points).
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they have some common points, but neither is a subset of the other).
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is a proper subset of y and they touch at their boundaries).
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is a proper subset of y and they don't touch at their boundaries).
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is a proper subset of x and they touch at their boundaries).
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is a proper subset of x and they don't touch at their boundaries).
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal (they have the exact same points).

Alright, I think I had the right understanding all along. So, given:

- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x, and they don't touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper subset of y, and they don't touch at their boundaries.

Therefore, z is a proper subset of y, and y is a proper subset of x. This means z is a proper subset of x.

Also, if z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Thus, z is a proper subset of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which means NTPPi(x,z).

I've been consistent in my reasoning, and I'm confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

To summarize, given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the relationship between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm concerned I may have been overthinking this. 

Let's use a different approach to double-check. I'll consider a specific example:
- Imagine x is a big circle.
- y is a smaller circle completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x.
- z is an even smaller circle completely inside y, not touching the boundary of y.

In this scenario, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

I think the answer is NTPPi(x,z). Let me double-check the definition of NTPPi once more, to be sure:

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

If z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, hang on. I think I've been overthinking this problem. Let me verify the definitions once more.

According to the standard definitions of the RCC-8 qualitative spatial reasoning calculus:

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. 
- NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse, meaning NTPP(y,x), which is that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

It follows by transitivity that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

I think I've been getting confused because I've been trying to avoid assuming transitivity, but transitivity is a basic property of the "part of" relation.

Let me summarize what I know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- If z is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x (transitivity).
- Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is the relationship between x and z.

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check if there's any other possible relationships between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let's reason about the topology: given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary), and y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary), it's impossible for z to have any part outside of x, or for z to touch the boundary of x. Thus, z must be completely inside x and not touching the boundary of x. This is precisely the definition of NTPPi(x,z).

I'm confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to analyze what happens when we have NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me recall the meaning of NTPPi:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
- NTPPi(y,z): z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary

What can we deduce about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x, it follows that z must be completely inside x. Furthermore, since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z cannot possibly touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
