PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem. We have that
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior parts
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts

We want to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z, among the RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Let's think about each possible relation and see whether it is consistent with the given relations EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

DC(x,z): This means that x and z are disconnected. This is certainly possible because if x and y touch at their boundaries, and y and z are disconnected, then x and z could easily be disconnected as well. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

EC(x,z): This means that x and z touch at their boundaries. This is also possible. For example, imagine x and y as two adjacent circles that touch, and z as a third circle that touches x but is disconnected from y. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

PO(x,z): This means that x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts. This is also possible. Imagine x and y as two adjacent circles that touch, and z as a circle that partially overlaps with x but is disconnected from y. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

TPP(x,z): This means that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Let's think about whether this is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

If x is part of z, and y touches x at the boundary, then y would have to touch z at the boundary as well, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Actually, let me think again. If x is part of z and touches z's boundary, and y touches x at x's boundary, it's possible that y touches x at a point where x does not touch z's boundary. In that case, y and z would be disconnected. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

NTPP(x,z): This means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z). If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then y could touch x at x's boundary while still being disconnected from z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

TPPi(x,z): This means that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Let's think about whether this is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

If z is part of x and y touches x at the boundary, it's possible that z is positioned within x such that it's disconnected from y. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

NTPPi(x,z): This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z). If z is well within x, and y touches x only at the boundary, then y and z could be disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

EQ(x,z): This means that x and z are coincident, i.e., they are the same region. This is not consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) because if x and z are the same, then the relation between y and z would be the same as the relation between y and x, which is EC, not DC. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Actually, let me check that again to be sure. If EQ(x,z), then z is the same as x. We know that EC(x,y), so that would mean EC(z,y). But we're also told that DC(y,z), which is a contradiction. So indeed EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me think again about TPP(x,z). I think my reasoning was flawed. If TPP(x,z), i.e., x is a tangential proper part of z, then y touches x at x's boundary. Since x touches z's boundary, is it possible that y is disconnected from z? Let me try to picture this.

If y touches x at x's boundary, and x touches z's boundary, then... it's still possible that y is disconnected from z. Imagine x as a circle touching the inside of a larger circle z at one point, and y as a circle touching x at a different point on x's boundary. Then y could be disconnected from z. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me also revisit TPPi(x,z), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of x. Is this consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z)? If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z touches x's boundary. Since y also touches x's boundary (because EC(x,y)), is it possible that y and z are disconnected? I think it is. Imagine x as a large circle, with y touching its boundary at one point, and z as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at a different point. Then y and z would be disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

Let's double-check the remaining relations to make sure my reasoning is correct.

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is not consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) because it would imply both EC(z,y) and DC(y,z), which is a contradiction.

Hmm, I think I made another mistake in reasoning about some of these cases. Let me think more carefully.

In all these cases, we have EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), and we're trying to figure out which relations are possible between x and z.

For TPP(x,z), i.e., x is a tangential proper part of z, the key question is whether this is consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z). If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y touches x at x's boundary, would y also have to touch z? 

Let's think geometrically. If x is a tangential proper part of z, that means x is inside z and touches z's boundary at some point. Now, y touches x at x's boundary. Could y touch x at a point where x does not touch z? If so, then y might be disconnected from z.

Actually, I think I was right before, and TPP(x,z) is indeed possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y touches x at a point on x's boundary where x does not touch z's boundary, then y could be disconnected from z.

Let me now carefully check each relation again:

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. If x and y touch at their boundaries, and y and z are disconnected, then x and z could be disconnected too.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible. If x and y touch at their boundaries, and y and z are disconnected, then x and z could touch at a point away from y.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. If x and y touch at their boundaries, and y and z are disconnected, then x and z could partially overlap in a region away from y.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is where I got confused earlier, but upon reflection, I think this is possible. If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y touches x at a point on x's boundary where x does not touch z's boundary, then y could be disconnected from z.

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and y touches x at x's boundary, then y would be entirely within z. But this would mean that y and z are not disconnected. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

Actually, I need to think about this again more carefully. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, that means x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary. If y touches x at x's boundary, then y would have to extend inside z. But then y and z would not be disconnected; they would have to share at least some points (where y touches x). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y touches x at x's boundary at a point away from z, then y and z could be disconnected.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and y touches x only at x's boundary, then y and z could be disconnected.

EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is not possible, as I explained earlier, because it would imply both EC(z,y) and DC(y,z), which is a contradiction.

Actually, I realize that I'm still confused about NTPP(x,z), so let me think about it again. NTPP(x,z) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries. DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. 

If x is completely inside z and y touches x at x's boundary, then y would have to extend inside z. But then y and z would not be disconnected; they would have to share at least the point where y touches x. So NTPP(x,z) is not consistent with EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Actually, I'm still not 100% sure about this. Let me think in terms of set theory. If NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper subset of the interior of z. If EC(x,y), then x and y have no common interior points, but their boundaries intersect. If DC(y,z), then y and z have no points in common, neither interior nor boundary. 

Now, if x is a proper subset of the interior of z, and y's boundary intersects with x's boundary, then y's boundary would have to intersect with the interior of z. But then y and z would have common points, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check TPP(x,z) again. TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and touches z's boundary at some point. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries. DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. 

If x touches z's boundary and y touches x's boundary, could y still be disconnected from z? Let me think in terms of set theory. If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper subset of z and x's boundary intersects with z's boundary. If EC(x,y), then x and y have no common interior points, but their boundaries intersect. If DC(y,z), then y and z have no points in common.

Now, if x's boundary intersects with z's boundary, and y's boundary intersects with x's boundary, could y and z still have no points in common? I think this depends on where exactly the intersections occur. If y's boundary intersects with x's boundary at a point where x's boundary does not intersect with z's boundary, then y and z could still be disconnected. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I'm realizing that there's a subtlety here that I've been overlooking. The definition of EC says that regions touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. The definition of DC says that regions are disconnected and share no spatial parts. The definition of TPP says that one region is part of another and touches its boundary.

Let me think again...

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but have no common interior parts. This means that the intersection of x and y is non-empty, but the intersection of their interiors is empty.

DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This means that the intersection of y and z is empty.

TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z. This means that x is a proper subset of z and the boundaries of x and z intersect.

NTPP(x,z) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that x is a proper subset of z and the boundaries of x and z do not intersect.

Now, let's reconsider each possible relation between x and z.

DC(x,z): This means that x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. This is possible. For example, if y is positioned between x and z such that it touches x but not z, then x and z would be disconnected.

EC(x,z): This means that x and z touch at their boundaries but have no common interior parts. This is possible. For example, if x and z touch at a point away from y, then y could be disconnected from z.

PO(x,z): This means that x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but neither is contained in the other. This is possible. If x and z overlap in a region away from y, then y could be disconnected from z.

TPP(x,z): This means that x is a tangential proper part of z. Is this possible given EC(x,y) and DC(y,z)? If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, would y necessarily touch z? Let's think about this more carefully.

If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y touches x's boundary, then y would have to extend inside z or touch z's boundary. But if y extends inside z, then y and z would have common points, which contradicts DC(y,z). And if y touches z's boundary, then y and z would also have common points, which again contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): This means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y would have to extend inside z. But then y and z would have common points, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): This means that z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches x's boundary at a different location, then y and z could be disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y and z could be disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

EQ(x,z): This means that x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then the relation between y and z would be the same as the relation between y and x, which is EC. But we're told that DC(y,z), which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

OK, let me revisit TPP(x,z) one more time, because I think I'm still getting confused. TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and touches z's boundary. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries. DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected.

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, would y necessarily touch or overlap with z? Let's consider a specific example. Imagine z as a disk, x as a smaller disk inside z that touches z's boundary at one point, and y as a disk outside z that touches x's boundary at a point where x does not touch z. In this case, y and z would be disconnected. So TPP(x,z) is actually possible. I think I've been making a mistake in my reasoning.

Actually, wait, let me think about this again. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely contained within z except for the points where x touches z's boundary. If y touches x's boundary, then y would have to either touch z's boundary (if y touches x at a point where x touches z) or extend inside z (if y touches x at a point where x does not touch z). 

In the first case, y and z would have common boundary points, which contradicts DC(y,z). In the second case, y and z would have common interior points, which also contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reason through this once more with a clear head. We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but have no common interior parts.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, i.e., they have no points in common.

We want to determine which of the RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. For example, if x and y touch at their boundaries, and y and z are disconnected, then x and z could be disconnected too.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is possible. For example, if x and z touch at a point away from y, then y could be disconnected from z.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. If x and z overlap in a region away from y, then y could be disconnected from z.

TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is entirely contained within z except for the points where x touches z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, then y would have to either touch z's boundary or extend inside z. In either case, y and z would have common points, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I'm still confused about this. If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning that x is a proper subset of z and the boundaries of x and z intersect. If EC(x,y), then the boundaries of x and y intersect but their interiors don't. If DC(y,z), then y and z have no common points.

Let's take a 2D example. Imagine z as a disk, x as a smaller disk inside z that touches z's boundary at one point, and y as a disk that touches x's boundary at a point where x does not touch z. 

But wait, if y touches x's boundary at a point where x does not touch z, then that point of x's boundary is in the interior of z. So if y touches that point, then y would have to extend into the interior of z, which means that y and z would have common points. This contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

It may be a subtle confusion in my mental picture. I'm trying to think of a scenario where TPP(x,z), EC(x,y), and DC(y,z) can all be true, but I don't think it's possible. The issue is that if x is a tangential proper part of z, then most of x's boundary is in the interior of z. If y touches x's boundary, it would either have to touch z's boundary or extend into z's interior, neither of which is consistent with DC(y,z).

NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that x is a proper subset of z and the boundaries of x and z do not intersect, i.e., x is completely inside z. If y touches x's boundary, it would have to extend into z's interior, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means that z is a proper subset of x and the boundaries of x and z intersect. If y touches x's boundary at a point away from z, then y and z could be disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that z is a proper subset of x and the boundaries of x and z do not intersect, i.e., z is completely inside x. If y touches x's boundary, then y and z could be disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then the relation between y and z would be the same as the relation between y and x, which is EC. But we're told that DC(y,z), which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let me double-check the reasoning for TPP and NTPP once more. I think my conclusion that they're not possible is correct, but my explanation could be clearer.

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z, which means that x is a proper subset of z and the boundaries of x and z intersect. Most of x's boundary is in the interior of z, except for the points where x touches z's boundary. If y touches x's boundary, it either touches a point of x's boundary that is in the interior of z, or it touches a point where x touches z's boundary. In the former case, y would have to extend into z's interior, which contradicts DC(y,z). In the latter case, y would have to touch z's boundary, which also contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means that x is a proper subset of z and the boundaries of x and z do not intersect, i.e., x is completely inside z. All of x's boundary is in the interior of z. If y touches x's boundary, it would have to extend into z's interior, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let's just double-check with a different approach. Let's consider the definitions of these relations in terms of the underlying topological relations.

Let me use the following notation:
- i(x) denotes the interior of x
- b(x) denotes the boundary of x

Then the RCC-8 relations can be defined as follows:
- DC(x,y): x ∩ y = ∅
- EC(x,y): i(x) ∩ i(y) = ∅ and x ∩ y ≠ ∅
- PO(x,y): i(x) ∩ i(y) ≠ ∅ and x ⊄ y and y ⊄ x
- TPP(x,y): x ⊂ y and x ∩ b(y) ≠ ∅
- NTPP(x,y): x ⊂ i(y)
- EQ(x,y): x = y

Given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), we know that:
- i(x) ∩ i(y) = ∅ and x ∩ y ≠ ∅
- y ∩ z = ∅

Now, let's check each possible relation between x and z:

DC(x,z): x ∩ z = ∅. This is possible. For example, if x and y are on one side and z is on the other side, then x and z could be disconnected.

EC(x,z): i(x) ∩ i(z) = ∅ and x ∩ z ≠ ∅. This is possible. For example, if x and z touch at a point away from y, then y could be disconnected from z.

PO(x,z): i(x) ∩ i(z) ≠ ∅ and x ⊄ z and z ⊄ x. This is possible. If x and z overlap in a region away from y, then y could be disconnected from z.

TPP(x,z): x ⊂ z and x ∩ b(z) ≠ ∅. If x is a subset of z and touches z's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, would y necessarily touch or overlap with z? Let's consider the following:
- Since x ⊂ z, we have x ∩ b(z) ⊂ z ∩ b(z) = b(z).
- Since EC(x,y), we know that x ∩ y ≠ ∅, and since x ∩ y ⊂ b(x) ∪ b(y), we have x ∩ y ⊂ b(x) ∩ b(y).
- If y intersects with x only at points where x touches z's boundary, i.e., if (x ∩ y) ⊂ (x ∩ b(z)), then y would have to touch z's boundary, which contradicts DC(y,z).
- If y intersects with x at points where x does not touch z's boundary, i.e., if (x ∩ y) ⊄ (x ∩ b(z)), then y would have to extend into the interior of z, which contradicts DC(y,z).
- In either case, y and z would have common points, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): x ⊂ i(z). If x is a subset of the interior of z, and y touches x's boundary, then y would have to extend into the interior of z. But then y and z would have common points, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z): z ⊂ x and z ∩ b(x) ≠ ∅. If z is a subset of x and touches x's boundary, and y touches x's boundary at a different location, then y and z could be disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): z ⊂ i(x). If z is a subset of the interior of x, and y touches x's boundary, then y and z could be disconnected. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

EQ(x,z): x = z. If x and z are the same region, then the relation between y and z would be the same as the relation between y and x, which is EC. But we're told that DC(y,z), which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which of the RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

First, let me recall what these given relations mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but share no interior parts
- DC(y,z): y and z are completely disconnected, sharing no parts

Now let's analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible - x could touch y at the boundary, while z is completely disconnected from both.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at boundaries only. This is possible - x could touch z at a point away from where x touches y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible - x could overlap with z in a region that doesn't include where x touches y.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is not possible. If x is inside z (touching z's boundary), and y touches x's boundary, then y would either have to touch z's boundary or extend into z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is not possible. If x is completely inside z, and y touches x's boundary, then y would extend into z, contradicting DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible - z could be inside x, touching x's boundary at a point away from where y touches x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible - z could be completely inside x, away from where y touches x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. This is not possible because it would mean EC(y,z), contradicting the given DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
