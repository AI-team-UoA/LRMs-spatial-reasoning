PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this situation:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely contained within the interior of x, not touching x's boundary.

2. NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So z completely contains y in its interior, and y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now I need to determine what relationship(s) could hold between x and z. Let's think through this systematically by considering each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know that y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y as a common part. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. But we know y is in the interior of both x and z, so they share interior points. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, sharing some parts but not all. This seems possible, as x contains y, z contains y, but x could extend beyond z in some areas while z extends beyond x in others.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is contained within z but touches z's boundary at some point.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely contained within the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. This seems possible if z is contained within x but touches x's boundary at some point.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching x's boundary. This seems challenging given our constraints, because we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of both x and z. If z were a non-tangential proper part of x, then z would be completely inside x, and y would be completely inside z, which is consistent with our given relations.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. This seems possible if x = z, and both properly contain y.

Let me check the consistency of each potential relation more carefully by using the transitivity of these spatial relations.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

For PO(x,z):
If x and z partially overlap, then y must be in the overlapping region since y is part of both x and z. This seems consistent.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is contained within z but touches z's boundary. Since y is a non-tangential proper part of x, y is contained well within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. By transitivity, y would be contained well within z and not touch z's boundary, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z's interior. Since y is contained within x's interior, y would be contained within z's interior, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is contained within x but touches x's boundary. However, y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is well inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But y is also a non-tangential proper part of x. If z touches x's boundary, there could be regions of z close to x's boundary, but y cannot be in those regions because y doesn't touch x's boundary. So this seems consistent as long as y is located in a region of z that's not near x's boundary.

However, I need to be more careful with TPPi(x,z). Let's reconsider. We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z touches x's boundary at some point. But we know y is completely inside z (non-tangentially) and y is completely inside x (non-tangentially). 

Actually, I think TPPi(x,z) is still possible. Let me draw it out conceptually:
- x is a larger region
- z is a smaller region entirely within x, but touching x's boundary at some point
- y is an even smaller region entirely within z, not touching z's boundary
- Since y is entirely within z, and z is entirely within x, y is also entirely within x and not touching x's boundary

So TPPi(x,z) seems consistent.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. By transitivity, y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y).

For EQ(x,z):
If x and z are identical, then y would be a non-tangential proper part of both, which is consistent with our given relations.

Let's summarize the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z):

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
6. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical

But wait, I need to be more careful about PO(x,z). If x and z partially overlap, then there are parts of x not in z and parts of z not in x. However, y is completely contained in z. If y is also completely contained in x (which is given by NTPPi(x,y)), then y is in the overlapping region of x and z. This seems consistent.

Let me double-check TPP(x,z) as well. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained in z but touches z's boundary. We know y is completely contained in x (from NTPPi(x,y)) and y is completely contained in z but doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)). Since y doesn't touch z's boundary but is contained in x, and x touches z's boundary, y must be located in a part of x that's not near z's boundary. This seems consistent.

I believe the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me carefully think about this again.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

I need to determine what spatial relation can hold between x and z.

Let me reconsider each relation systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is impossible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least y as a common part.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect:
   This is impossible because y is in the interior of both x and z, so they share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This means x and z share some parts but not all. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, this is consistent with y being in the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This means x is completely contained in z but touches z's boundary. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), and y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)). This seems consistent.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This means x is completely contained in z's interior without touching z's boundary. Since y is in x's interior and x is in z's interior, y is in z's interior, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This means z is completely contained in x but touches x's boundary. y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), and y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)). This seems consistent.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This means z is completely contained in x's interior without touching x's boundary. Since y is in z's interior and z is in x's interior, y is in x's interior, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are identical:
   If x = z, then y would be a non-tangential proper part of both, which is consistent with our given relations.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Let me double-check PO(x,z) more carefully. In the case of partial overlap, there's a region that belongs to both x and z, a region that belongs only to x, and a region that belongs only to z. Given that y is a non-tangential proper part of x and a non-tangential proper part of z, y must be in the overlapping region. This still seems consistent.

So, I believe my answer is correct: the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

However, I should be careful about the transitivity of these relations. Let me check if there are any known transitivity rules for the given relations that might narrow down the possible relations between x and z.

From the RCC-8 composition table:

The composition of NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) could give us constraints on the relation between x and z.

I don't have the exact composition table memorized, but I'll try to derive it logically.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

Now, let's think about what this means geometrically. y is strictly inside x, not touching x's boundary. And y is strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Given these constraints, x and z could relate to each other in several ways:
1. x and z could partially overlap (PO)
2. x could be a proper part of z, either touching z's boundary (TPP) or not (NTPP)
3. z could be a proper part of x, either touching x's boundary (TPPi) or not (NTPPi)
4. x and z could be identical (EQ)

All of these seem geometrically possible given our constraints. Without additional information, I don't see a way to narrow it down further.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me try to find any counterexamples for the proposed relations:

1. PO(x,z): Consider x and z as overlapping circles with y as a small circle inside the overlapping region. y can be entirely inside both x and z without touching their boundaries, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So PO is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): Consider x as a circle tangent to the boundary of a larger circle z, and y as a small circle inside x but not touching x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So TPP is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): Consider x as a circle completely inside a larger circle z, not touching z's boundary, and y as a small circle inside x but not touching x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So NTPP is possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): Consider z as a circle tangent to the boundary of a larger circle x, and y as a small circle inside z but not touching z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So TPPi is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): Consider z as a circle completely inside a larger circle x, not touching x's boundary, and y as a small circle inside z but not touching z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So NTPPi is possible.

6. EQ(x,z): Consider x and z as the same circle, and y as a small circle inside this circle, not touching its boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). So EQ is possible.

I can't find any counterexamples, so it seems all six relations (PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Actually, let me check once more using the properties of the RCC-8 relations:

1. Given NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

2. Given NTPP(y,z), we know that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

3. The question is: what can we infer about the relationship between x and z?

For PO(x,z), x and z would partially overlap. If y is inside both x and z, then y must be in the overlapping region. This is consistent with our given relations.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a tangential proper part of z. Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and x is inside z but touches z's boundary, y would be inside z but not touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

For NTPP(x,z), x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, y would be inside z and not touch z's boundary. This is consistent with NTPP(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z), z would be a tangential proper part of x. Since y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and z is inside x but touches x's boundary, y would be inside x but not touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. Since y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y would be inside x and not touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y).

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. If y is inside this region and doesn't touch its boundary, then y is a non-tangential proper part of both x and z, which is consistent with our given relations.

So, all six relations (PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) seem possible between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Actually, let me re-examine my reasoning about PO(x,z). If x and z partially overlap, then there's a region that belongs to both x and z, a region that belongs only to x, and a region that belongs only to z. 

Given that y is a non-tangential proper part of both x and z, y must be in the overlapping region. But is this really consistent with the given relations?

If y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z)), then y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means y is well inside the overlapping region of x and z, not near the boundary where x and z separate. Similarly, if y is a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,y) or equivalently NTPP(y,x)), then y is well inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

So, y would be in the interior of the overlapping region of x and z, which is consistent with both NTPP(y,z) and NTPPi(x,y).

I think PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

So, to summarize, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, I'm a bit uncertain about this, and would like to carefully go through it one more time.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(y,z): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's think about this geometrically:
- y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This would mean x and z have no common points. But we know y is a part of both x and z, so they must have at least y in common. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect:
   This would mean x and z touch only at their boundaries. But we know y is in the interior of both x and z, so they share interior points, not just boundary points. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This would mean x and z share some parts but not all. Given that y is a proper part of both x and z, this is consistent with y being in the overlapping region. So PO is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This would mean x is completely contained in z but touches z's boundary. Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), and x is inside z, y would be inside z, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So TPP is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This would mean x is completely contained in z's interior without touching z's boundary. Since y is in x's interior and x is in z's interior, y is in z's interior, which is consistent with NTPP(y,z). So NTPP is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This would mean z is completely contained in x but touches x's boundary. Since y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), and z is inside x, y would be inside x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This would mean z is completely contained in x's interior without touching x's boundary. Since y is in z's interior and z is in x's interior, y is in x's interior, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are identical:
   If x and z are the same region, then y would be a non-tangential proper part of both, which is consistent with our given relations. So EQ is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

I'm fairly confident in this answer now. Let's double-check our reasoning for each relation one more time:

DC(x,z) - Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must overlap.
EC(x,z) - Not possible because y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior points, not just boundary points.
PO(x,z) - Possible if x and z partially overlap, with y in the overlapping region.
TPP(x,z) - Possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, with y inside x but not touching x's boundary.
NTPP(x,z) - Possible if x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, with y inside x but not touching x's boundary.
TPPi(x,z) - Possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, with y inside z but not touching z's boundary.
NTPPi(x,z) - Possible if z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, with y inside z but not touching z's boundary.
EQ(x,z) - Possible if x and z are identical, with y inside both but not touching their boundary.

So our answer is that the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships could exist between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me break down what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - impossible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least this region
2. EC(x,z) - impossible because y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior points

The following relationships are all possible:
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap, with y in their overlapping region
4. TPP(x,z) - x is inside z and touches z's boundary
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is completely inside z without touching its boundary
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is inside x and touches x's boundary
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is completely inside x without touching its boundary
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are identical

For each possible relation, we can verify that y remains a non-tangential proper part of both x and z.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
