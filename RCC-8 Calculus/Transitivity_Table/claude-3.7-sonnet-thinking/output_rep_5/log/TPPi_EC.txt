PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): This means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is properly contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z): This means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about what we know about the positions of x, y, and z:
- y is properly contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
- y and z touch at their boundaries.

Given these constraints, let's think about the possible ways x and z could relate:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: This doesn't seem possible. Since y touches the boundary of x, and y also touches z, there's a path from x to z through y. They can't be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected: This is possible. y touches the boundary of x, and y also touches z. If z doesn't extend beyond the boundary of x, then x and z would touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: This is possible. If z extends beyond the boundary of x in some areas, but also has parts inside x (specifically, the parts that touch y), then x and z would partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This doesn't seem possible. x contains y, and y touches z, so x can't be contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This definitely isn't possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This is possible. If z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x (which is plausible given that y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary), then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This doesn't seem possible. Since y touches z and y also touches the boundary of x, z must be touching the boundary of x, which contradicts the definition of a non-tangential proper part.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This doesn't seem possible given the constraints. If y is a proper part of x, and y is externally connected to z, then z can't be equal to x.

Actually, let me rethink this. I think I may have been a bit hasty in ruling out some of the possibilities. Let me go through them more carefully.

Let's start with what we know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries.

Now, let's consider each RCC-8 relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: If y touches the boundary of x, and y also touches z, then there's a path from x to z through y. So x and z can't be disconnected. This isn't a valid possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected: If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y also touches z's boundary, then it's possible for x and z to touch at their boundaries. This is a valid possibility.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: If z extends both inside and outside of x, then x and z partially overlap. Given the constraints, this is a valid possibility.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But since y is inside x, and y touches z's boundary, this configuration seems impossible. It would require y to somehow be both inside x and on the boundary of z, which contradicts the fact that y is a tangential proper part of x. So this isn't a valid possibility.

Actually, wait. Let me think about this more carefully. If y is a tangential proper part of x, that means y is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y is externally connected to z, that means y and z touch at their boundaries. 

If x were a tangential proper part of z, that would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is inside x, y would also be inside z. For y to be externally connected to z, y would need to touch z's boundary. But if y is inside x, and x is inside z, then y wouldn't be on the boundary of z, contradicting EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) isn't a valid possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This would mean x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This contradicts the fact that y touches z's boundary and y is inside x. So this isn't a valid possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside x, touches x's boundary, and touches z's boundary, this is a valid configuration. So TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But since y touches both z's boundary and x's boundary, z must touch x's boundary, contradicting the definition of a non-tangential proper part. So this isn't a valid possibility.

Hmm actually I need to rethink this one. If y is a tangential proper part of x, y touches x's boundary. If y is externally connected to z, y and z touch at their boundaries. It's possible for z to be entirely inside x and not touch x's boundary. In this case, y would touch both x's boundary and z's boundary, but z wouldn't touch x's boundary. So actually, NTPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Actually, let me draw this out more carefully. We know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries.

Now let's consider if z is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., NTPPi(x,z)):
- z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- y is also inside x.
- y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary.

Is this configuration possible? Let's think: y needs to touch both x's boundary and z's boundary. If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then there's space between z and x's boundary. y could occupy some of this space, touching both x's boundary and z's boundary. So, yes, it is possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Actually, I'm not convinced about this. Let me try once more.

For NTPP(x,z), We are assuming:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

If z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then y would need to stretch from z's boundary to x's boundary. This would mean y has some interior, which contradicts the fact that y and z are externally connected (they only touch at their boundaries). So NTPPi(x,z) isn't a valid possibility.

Actually, let me be clear: "externally connected" (EC) means that they share boundary points, but don't share any interior points. But it doesn't mean that the entire boundary of y touches z. It might just be that a part of y's boundary touches a part of z's boundary. So y can touch x's boundary, and a different part of y's boundary can touch z's boundary. Let me rethink with this in mind.

For NTPPi(x,z), We are assuming:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches both x's boundary and z's boundary, that doesn't create a contradiction. y would be situated such that it spans from z's boundary to x's boundary. The only requirement for EC(y,z) is that y and z touch at their boundaries and don't share interior points, not that they touch along their entire boundaries.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility. 

Actually, let me be a bit pedantic. Topologically, NTPP means non-tangential proper part, which means that the closure of x is a proper subset of the interior of z. In English: x is fully inside z, with a "buffer zone" between the boundary of x and the boundary of z.

So, for NTPPi(x,z), the boundary of z must be strictly inside x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of x, it means y touches the boundary of x. And if y is externally connected to z, it means y touches the boundary of z. But if the boundary of z is strictly inside x, and y touches both the boundary of x and the boundary of z, then y must have some interior points (it spans from the boundary of z to the boundary of x). But this doesn't contradict any of our constraints. 

So my final judgment is: yes, NTPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This would mean x and z are the same region. But if y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y also touches z's boundary, then y touches its own boundary, which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) isn't a valid possibility.

Actually, I need to be more precise here. If y is a tangential proper part of x, it means y is inside x and touches x's boundary. If y is externally connected to z, it means y and z touch at their boundaries. If x and z are the same region (EQ(x,z)), then the boundary of x is the same as the boundary of z. But then, if y touches the boundary of x, it also touches the boundary of z. But since y is already inside z (since z is the same as x), this means y is both inside z and touches z's boundary, which is consistent with y being a tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts our original premise that y is externally connected to z. So EQ(x,z) isn't a valid possibility.

Actually, let me try one last time. We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries.

if EQ(x,z), then z = x.

- If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, then y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- If y is inside z and touches z's boundary, then y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., TPP(y,z) or equivalently TPPi(z,y).
- But we also know that y is externally connected to z, i.e., EC(y,z).
- TPPi(z,y) and EC(y,z) are contradictory; a region can't be both a tangential proper part of another and externally connected to it.

So, EQ(x,z) isn't a valid possibility.

To summarize, the valid possibilities for the relationship between x and z are:
1. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected.
2. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
3. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
4. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Wait I need to re-examine NTPPi(x,z), because I'm not sure about this. 

Let's set up a concrete example to check if NTPPi(x,z) is consistent with our constraints. We're trying to determine if z can be entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x.

Imagine x is a circular region, and y is a smaller circular region inside x, touching the boundary of x. Now, z is another circular region inside x, smaller than x but possibly larger than y. We want to check if z can be entirely inside x without touching the boundary of x, while also being externally connected to y.

For z to be externally connected to y, z and y must touch at their boundaries. If y is already touching the boundary of x, and z is touching y, can z still not touch the boundary of x? Yes, if z touches y at a point that's not on the boundary of x. In this case, z would be entirely inside x, not touching the boundary of x, but touching y, which in turn touches the boundary of x. This is a valid configuration.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is indeed a valid possibility. 

Actually, now that I think about it, let me restate. If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, for EC(y,z) to be true, it must be that y touches z at a different point than where y touches the boundary of x. This is topologically possible.

Thus my original statement is correct. NTPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Actually wait. Let me try this geometrically. Imagine z is in the interior of x. This means z is surrounded by x on all sides. We know y touches the boundary of x, and y also touches z. This is only possible if y "straddles" the area between z and the boundary of x. But this is perfectly consistent with the definitions of the relations. y can be a region that touches both z and the boundary of x, without z touching the boundary of x.

Ah actually I need to make sure I'm not misinterpreting "tangential proper part" (TPP). TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is inside x and touches x's boundary. It doesn't mean y is a particular type of region (like a line or a point). It's just a relationship between two regions. So y could be any shape, and the fact that it's a tangential proper part of x means it's inside x and touches x's boundary.

So I think it's valid to say that NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

To summarize, the valid possibilities for the relationship between x and z are:
1. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected.
2. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
3. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
4. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me try to prove this conclusion. We assume:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries.

1. EC(x,z) is possible: y is touching the boundary of x, and z is touching the boundary of y. If z is positioned such that it's outside of x, and the point where y and z touch is on the boundary of x, then x and z would touch at their boundaries.

2. PO(x,z) is possible: If z is positioned such that it's partly inside and partly outside of x, and the part that's inside touches y, then x and z would partially overlap.

3. TPPi(x,z) is possible: If z is entirely inside x, touching the boundary of x at the point where y also touches the boundary of x, then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

4. NTPPi(x,z) is possible: If z is entirely inside x, not touching the boundary of x, but touching y at a point away from the boundary of x, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

All other relationships contradict our assumptions. Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Wait, I need to check TPP(x,z). This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But since y is inside x, y would also be inside z. For y to be externally connected to z, y would need to touch z's boundary, which is compatible with both y and x touching z's boundary. This seems like a valid configuration, so I should add TPP(x,z) to my list of possibilities. Let me check.

Let's go through the constraints once more: 
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary. 
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Now, if TPP(x,z) - which means x is inside z and touches z's boundary - how does that interact with the above two constraints?

If x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x). For y to be externally connected to z, y needs to touch z's boundary but can't have any interior points in common with z. But if y is inside z, how can it have no interior points in common with z? This seems impossible. So, TPP(x,z) isn't a valid possibility.

So my final list of possibilities is: EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I think I'm getting confused with the definition of TPPi. TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. We're given TPPi(x,y), which means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. That's what I've been using, so I think I'm on the right track.

I think the issue is with how I'm thinking of "tangential proper part" (TPP). Let me go back to the definition. TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. A proper part means x is fully contained in z.

So, if TPP(x,z), we have x is fully contained in z, and x touches the boundary of z. We also know that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. This means y is fully inside x, and touches the boundary of x. If we combine these, we get that y is fully inside z and might or might not touch the boundary of z.

But we also know EC(y,z), which means y and z touch at their boundaries but have no interior overlap. But if y is inside z, it does have interior overlap with z. This is a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

OK so I'm right. The possible relationships between x and z are: EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Let me double-check on the ones I included:

1. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected: If y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y also touches the boundary of z, then it's possible for x and z to touch at their boundaries.

2. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: If z extends both inside and outside of x, and the part of z that's inside x touches y, then x and z would partially overlap.

3. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: If z is entirely inside x, touching the boundary of x at the point where y also touches the boundary of x, then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

4. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: If z is entirely inside x, not touching the boundary of x, but touching y, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Hmm, but wait. For EC(x,z) I said "the point where y and z touch is on the boundary of x" -- in that case y would not be a tangential proper part of x, it would be a part of the boundary, which violates TPPi(x,y). Let me think this through carefully.

OK it's still possible. If y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, then y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x, not on the boundary of x, but y touches the boundary of x. Now, if y also touches the boundary of z, and z is positioned such that it's outside of x, but the point where y touches z is also on the boundary of x, then x and z would be externally connected.

Actually, this seems a bit contrived. Let me think about it differently. If y is inside x and touches the boundary of x at a point p, and z is outside of x but also touches the boundary of x at the same point p, would y and z be touching? Not necessarily. y is inside x, z is outside x, and both touch the boundary of x at point p. But that doesn't mean y and z touch each other. They would both touch the boundary of x at the same point, but they wouldn't necessarily touch each other. 

Actually, I think it's valid to say EC(x,z) is possible.

Oh wait, I'm confusing myself. Let's be clear about what TPPi(x,y) means. It means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is fully inside x, and y touches the boundary of x. It doesn't mean y is part of the boundary of x.

So y is a region inside x, and y touches the boundary of x at some point p. Now, EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries. So z touches the boundary of y at some point q. Does this mean z also touches the boundary of x? Not necessarily. y could touch the boundary of x at point p, and z could touch the boundary of y at a different point q. In this case, z might be entirely inside x, or it might be partly inside and partly outside x, or it might be entirely outside x.

If z is entirely outside x, but touches y at a point on the boundary of x, then x and z would be externally connected. So EC(x,z) is a valid possibility.

So my list still holds. The possible relationships between x and z are: EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

And actually, let me be even more explicitly clear. We are given that:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is properly contained in x and y touches the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts.

Now, given these constraints, we're trying to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's go through the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: If y touches z, and y is part of x, then x and z must touch at least through y. So DC(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected: This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if z is outside of x, but touches x at the point where y also touches the boundary of x.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: This means x and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z is partly inside and partly outside of x, and the part that's inside touches y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This means x is properly contained in z and x touches the boundary of z. We know y is properly contained in x, so y would also be properly contained in z. But then y and z would share interior parts, contradicting EC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This means x is properly contained in z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. Like with TPP, this would mean y is properly contained in z, contradicting EC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: This means z is properly contained in x and z touches the boundary of x. This is possible if z is inside x, and z touches x's boundary at the point where y also touches x's boundary. Note that y and z would still only touch at their boundaries, satisfying EC(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: This means z is properly contained in x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible if z is inside x, away from the boundary of x, but z touches y. Since y touches the boundary of x, and z touches y but not the boundary of x, y and z would touch at their boundaries, satisfying EC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal: This means x and z are the same region. We know y is properly contained in x, so y would also be properly contained in z. But this contradicts EC(y,z), which says y and z don't share interior parts. So EQ(x,z) is not a valid possibility.

So, the valid possibilities for the relationship between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Thus, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I'll analyze what these constraints tell us about the spatial relationship between x and z.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

Let me check each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Not possible. Since y touches z and y is part of x, x and z can't be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected: Possible. If z is outside x but touches x's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping: Possible. If z extends partly inside and partly outside x, with the inside portion touching y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: Not possible. If x were inside z, then y would also be inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: Not possible, for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x: Possible. If z is inside x and touches x's boundary at the same point where y touches it.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x: Possible. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, but touches y (which does touch x's boundary).

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Not possible. If x and z were identical, y would be inside both, contradicting EC(y,z).
