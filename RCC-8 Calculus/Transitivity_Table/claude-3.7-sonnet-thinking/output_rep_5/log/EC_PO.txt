PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what the constraints EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) tell us:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. PO(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Now, I need to determine what spatial relation(s) could hold between x and z.

First, let's list all the possible RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Now, let's think about which of these can hold given our constraints:

Given that EC(x,y), x shares only a boundary with y, not any interior points.
Given that PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points.

Let's analyze case by case:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected? Yes, x could be completely separate from z, even though both interact with y (x touches y's boundary, and z overlaps with y).

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z touch only at a boundary? Yes, x could touch z at a boundary point, especially if that boundary point is also on y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap? Yes, x could overlap with a portion of z, particularly if that portion doesn't overlap with y (since x doesn't share interior with y).

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z? This seems unlikely because x touches y only at the boundary, and y overlaps with z. If x were completely inside z, it would be hard to ensure that x only touches y at the boundary while y has interior overlap with z. But there might be specific arrangements where this is possible, so I should be careful here.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z? Similar to TPP, this seems unlikely, but I should be careful.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x? Again, this seems unlikely given the constraints, but I should verify.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x? Similar to TPPi, this seems unlikely.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are identical? This is definitely not possible, because if x = z, then the relation between x and y would be the same as between y and z, which would be PO. But we're given that the relation between x and y is EC, which is different from PO.

Let me double-check my reasoning for the TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi cases:

For TPP(x,z):
Imagine x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Also, x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior with y. y and z share interior. This configuration is possible. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle partially overlapping with z, and x as a tiny circle inside z that touches y's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z):
Imagine x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Also, x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior with y. y and z share interior. This configuration seems possible as well. For example, imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle partially overlapping with z, and x as a tiny circle inside z (but not touching z's boundary) that touches y's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z):
Imagine z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Also, x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior with y. y and z share interior. This configuration seems impossible. If z is inside x and z overlaps with y, then x would have to overlap with y, which contradicts EC(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z):
Imagine z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Also, x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior with y. y and z share interior. This configuration is also impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

So, based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I want to take a closer look at the TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) cases.

For TPP(x,z):
In this case, x is contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior. I need to see if this configuration is consistent.

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then y's boundary must pass through or touch z's boundary at least at one point (the point where x touches y's boundary). This means y and z either share a boundary point or overlap, which is consistent with PO(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
In this case, x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. This means y's boundary must enter z (to touch x). Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior, which is consistent with y's boundary entering z. So, NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

I should also re-check TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z):

For TPPi(x,z):
In this case, z is contained within x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior. 

If z is inside x and z shares interior with y, then x and y must share interior (through z), which contradicts EC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
Similar to the TPPi case, if z is completely inside x and z shares interior with y, then x and y must share interior, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I think I should verify TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) once more, as they seem a bit counter-intuitive.

For TPP(x,z):
In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior.

Let's imagine concrete examples:
- z is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle that partially overlaps with z.
- x is a tiny circle inside z, touching z's boundary, and also touching y's boundary at a point where y and z overlap.

Wait, this doesn't work. If x touches y's boundary at a point where y and z overlap, then that point is in the interior of z, not on z's boundary. But for TPP(x,z), x must touch z's boundary.

Let me re-imagine:
- z is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle that partially overlaps with z.
- x is a tiny circle inside z, touching z's boundary at a point, and also touching y's boundary at a different point.

Now, the question is: Can x touch y's boundary without overlapping with y's interior? If y's boundary crosses z's boundary, then x can touch y's boundary at a point where it also touches z's boundary. But this means x and y touch at a point that's on the boundary of both z and y, which is consistent with EC(x,y).

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior.

Let's imagine:
- z is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle that partially overlaps with z.
- x is a tiny circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and touching y's boundary at a point.

For x to touch y's boundary and be completely inside z, y's boundary must enter the interior of z. This is consistent with PO(y,z). And x can touch y's boundary without overlapping with y's interior, which is consistent with EC(x,y).

So, NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

Based on my analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I've been overthinking a bit. Let me take a step back and approach this more systematically.

We're given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

We're asked to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Given these constraints, the most direct approach is to think of concrete examples for each potential relation between x and z and check if they are consistent with the given conditions.

1. DC(x,z):
Imagine x and z as two separate circles that do not touch, and y as a circle that touches x's boundary and partially overlaps with z. This is consistent with our constraints.

2. EC(x,z):
Imagine x and z as two circles that touch at a point, and y as a circle that touches x's boundary at a different point and partially overlaps with z. This is consistent.

3. PO(x,z):
Imagine x and z as two circles that partially overlap, and y as a circle that touches x's boundary at a point outside of z and partially overlaps with z. This is consistent.

4. TPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a larger circle, x as a smaller circle completely inside z and touching z's boundary, and y as a circle outside of z that touches x's boundary at the same point where x touches z's boundary. This is consistent.

5. NTPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a larger circle, x as a smaller circle completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y as a circle that partially enters z and touches x's boundary. This is consistent.

6. TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a larger circle, z as a smaller circle completely inside x and touching x's boundary, and y as a circle that touches x's boundary at a different point than where z touches x's boundary and partially overlaps with z. But for y to overlap with z, it must enter x, which would make y overlap with x. This contradicts EC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
Similar to the TPPi case, if z is inside x and y overlaps with z, then y must overlap with x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
If x and z are the same, and y is externally connected to x, then y would be externally connected to z. But we're given that y partially overlaps with z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I realize I should be even more precise when checking if a specific configuration is possible. Let me approach this one more time, very carefully, for the cases I'm less certain about.

For TPP(x,z):
In TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior.
Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior, but neither is a part of the other.

For this to be consistent, y must touch x's boundary (due to EC(x,y)) and also overlap with z (due to PO(y,z)). Since x is inside z and touches z's boundary, y can touch x at a point where x touches z's boundary. This allows y to touch x without entering it (maintaining EC(x,y)) and still overlap with z elsewhere (maintaining PO(y,z)).

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
In NTPP(x,z), x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior.
Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior, but neither is a part of the other.

For this to be consistent, y must touch x's boundary (due to EC(x,y)) and also overlap with z (due to PO(y,z)). Since x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, y must enter the interior of z to touch x. This allows y to touch x without entering it (maintaining EC(x,y)) and still overlap with z (maintaining PO(y,z)).

So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
In TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior.
Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior, but neither is a part of the other.

For this to be consistent, y must touch x's boundary (due to EC(x,y)) and also overlap with z (due to PO(y,z)). Since z is inside x, for y to overlap with z, y must enter the interior of x. But this would contradict EC(x,y), which requires that y and x don't share interior.

Actually, there's a scenario I missed. Let's imagine:
- x is a larger circle.
- z is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at a point p.
- y is a circle that touches x's boundary at the same point p and partially overlaps with z.

In this case, y can touch x at a point without entering it (maintaining EC(x,y)) and still overlap with z (maintaining PO(y,z)).

But wait, if y and z overlap, and z is inside x, then y must enter the interior of x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is still not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
In NTPPi(x,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior.
Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior, but neither is a part of the other.

For this to be consistent, y must touch x's boundary (due to EC(x,y)) and also overlap with z (due to PO(y,z)). Since z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, for y to overlap with z, y must enter the interior of x. But this would contradict EC(x,y), which requires that y and x don't share interior.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z):
In EQ(x,z), x and z are coincident.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior.
Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior, but neither is a part of the other.

If x and z are the same, then the relation between x and y would be the same as the relation between z and y. We're given that the relation between y and z is PO, but the relation between x and y is EC. These are different relations, so x and z cannot be the same.

So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on my careful analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me take one final look at TPPi(x,z), as this was a tricky case.

For TPPi(x,z):
In TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary at at least one point.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior.
Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior, but neither is a part of the other.

For y to overlap with z, y must have some part inside z. Since z is inside x, this means y must have some part inside x. But this contradicts EC(x,y), which specifies that x and y don't share any interior.

So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Alright, I'm now confident in my analysis.

The possible relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundary but don't share interior parts.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share some interior parts, but neither is contained in the other.

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x could be disconnected from z, while x touches y's boundary and y overlaps with z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x could touch z's boundary without sharing interior, while also touching y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x could partially overlap with z, while only touching y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be a tangential proper part of z (inside z and touching z's boundary), while also touching y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still touching y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is inside x and z overlaps with y, then y must enter x's interior, contradicting EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, then x would have to partially overlap with y (since z does), contradicting EC(x,y).
