PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this carefully. We're given that EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). Let's understand what each of these means.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, which could be any of the eight relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

Let's go through each possibility:

1. Could x and z be disconnected, i.e., DC(x,z)?
   We know that x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)). This means x could be outside of z completely, making DC(x,z) a possibility.

2. Could x and z be externally connected, i.e., EC(x,z)?
   Since y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), it's possible that x also touches z's boundary from the outside. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. Could x and z partially overlap, i.e., PO(x,z)?
   Given that x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), it's possible that x extends beyond y and penetrates into z, creating a partial overlap. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. Could x be a tangential proper part of z, i.e., TPP(x,z)?
   Given that x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), it's possible that x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z)?
   If x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), it's still possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. Could z be a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x)?
   We know that y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), which means z is strictly larger than y. Since x only touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), it cannot contain all of z. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x)?
   Similar to the reasoning above, if y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x only touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then x cannot contain all of z. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. Could x and z be equal, i.e., EQ(x,z)?
   If y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x only touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then x cannot be equal to z. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me double check the reasoning for each of these.

Actually, let me be a bit more careful with this analysis. I need to consider the constraints more carefully.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   Since y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), x might be outside of z. This is possible if x just touches y from the outside of z.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary.
   Since y doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), x could touch z's boundary from the outside. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   Given that x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), x could extend into z and also outside of z, creating a partial overlap. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and is completely inside z, touching z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) holds. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   If x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds. This seems plausible, but I need to consider if it's actually possible given the constraints.
   
   Let me think about this more carefully. If EC(x,y), then x touches y's boundary. If NTPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given these constraints, is it possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?
   
   I think it's not possible. If x touches y's boundary and y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x must be at least as close to z's boundary as y is. If x is to be a non-tangential proper part of z, it would have to be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary and y is already not touching z's boundary, then x would have to penetrate into y or extend outside of z to touch y's boundary. This contradicts both EC(x,y) and NTPP(x,z). So I don't think NTPP(x,z) is possible.

   Actually, let me think about this more carefully. If y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), it's still possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary if x is also strictly inside z and just touches y's boundary from within z. So I think NTPP(x,z) is still a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z) or TPP(z,x) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   If y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x only touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then z extends beyond y. If z is to be a proper part of x, then x would have to contain all of z, which includes points that are not in y and are not on y's boundary. But EC(x,y) stipulates that x only shares boundary points with y, not interior points or points outside of y. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) or NTPP(z,x) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to the reasoning above, if z extends beyond y and x only shares boundary points with y, then x cannot contain all of z. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   If y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x only touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then x and z have different extents, so they cannot be equal. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me re-evaluate possibility 5, which is NTPP(x,z).

We have EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). 

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

If x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can x still be completely inside z without touching z's boundary? Let's think about this carefully.

If y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), there's a "buffer zone" between y and the boundary of z. If x only touches y's boundary and doesn't extend outside of this buffer zone, then x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

But we know that x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)) and doesn't share any interior points with y. This means x can only touch y from the outside. If x is to be completely inside z, it would have to share interior points with z that are not in y. But if x doesn't share interior points with y, how can it be completely inside z while touching y's boundary?

I think I misunderstood earlier. Let's clarify. EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but have no interior points in common. This doesn't mean x is outside of y; it just means they don't overlap in the interior. So x could be partly inside z, touching y's boundary, and extending outside of z as well.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), and y is already not touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), then x would also have to be not touching z's boundary and be completely inside z.

Let's break this down differently. We have a region y that's completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. We have another region x that touches y's boundary but doesn't overlap with y's interior. Can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

The way I'm thinking about this is that if x touches y's boundary, and y is already inside z, then x could be "swallowed up" by z, with x sitting between y and the boundary of z, touching y but not touching the boundary of z.

Actually, I think there's a deeper conceptual issue here. Let's consider the constraints more carefully.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means x is outside of y, touching it only at the boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, for NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If x is outside of y, touching only y's boundary, and y is inside z not touching z's boundary, can x still be completely inside z? Yes, it's possible if the "buffer zone" between y and z's boundary is large enough to contain x.

So, NTPP(x,z) is still a possibility.

Let me review the possible relationships between x and z once more:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible if x touches y from outside z.
2. EC(x,z) - Possible if x touches y from inside z and also touches z's boundary.
3. PO(x,z) - Possible if x partially extends into z and partially outside.
4. TPP(x,z) - Possible if x is completely inside z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible if x is completely inside z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible given the constraints.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible given the constraints.
8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible given the constraints.

So the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, I've been thinking about this more, and I'm not sure if NTPP(x,z) is possible. Let me reconsider.

We have EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means x is outside of y, only touching it at the boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

If x is outside of y, touching only y's boundary, and y is inside z not touching z's boundary, can x still be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

Let's think of it this way: We have a region y that's completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. We have another region x that's outside of y, touching y only at the boundary. For x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x would have to fit in the "buffer zone" between y and z's boundary.

But here's the issue: If y is not touching z's boundary, and x is touching y's boundary from the outside, x could extend beyond y in a direction toward z's boundary. If x extends far enough, it could touch or even cross z's boundary. But it's also possible that x doesn't extend that far and stays completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

So NTPP(x,z) does seem possible if the "buffer zone" between y and z's boundary is large enough to contain x entirely.

OK, let me review the possibilities one more time.

We have EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z). We want to know the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   If x touches y from the outside of z, they are disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary.
   If x touches y from the inside of z and also touches z's boundary, this is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   If x extends into z and also outside of z, creating a partial overlap, this is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x is completely inside z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary, this is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   If x is completely inside z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary, this is possible. (the "buffer zone" between y and z's boundary can be large enough to contain x entirely, where x touches y's boundary but not z's).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, wait, let me think about some conceptual problems. 

We're in a spatial domain and have the constraint that these are the possible relationships: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ. These are all mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities (they are jointly exhaustive).

I was thinking of EC(x,y) as "x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts," which implies x is outside of y, touching it only at the boundary. But in the RCC-8 calculus, this means they externally connect, so they don't overlap in the interior. This means x is outside of y, touching it only at the boundary. It doesn't extend into y.

Ok, I think my earlier reasoning is essentially right, but just to be sure, I'll reconsider the entire problem step by step.

We have EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected, i.e., they touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. So, x is outside of y, touching it only at the boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   If x is outside of y, touching only y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x could be entirely outside of z. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected.
   If x touches y's boundary and also extends to touch z's boundary, but doesn't share any interior points with z, then EC(x,z) holds. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   If x touches y's boundary, extends into z, and also has a part outside of z, then PO(x,z) holds. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x is completely inside z, touches y's boundary, and also touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) holds. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   If x is completely inside z, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds. As I reasoned earlier, this is possible if the "buffer zone" between y and z's boundary is large enough to contain x.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   If z is to be a proper part of x, then x would have to contain all of z. But we know y is strictly inside z, and x only touches y's boundary. It's not possible for x to contain all of z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to the reasoning above, if z extends beyond y and x only touches y's boundary, then x cannot contain all of z. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   If y is strictly inside z, and x only touches y's boundary, then x and z have different extents. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me double check my reasoning for NTPP(x,z) once more.

The key is: Can we have a region x that touches y's boundary, but is also completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary?

Since y is strictly inside z (NTPP(y,z)), there's a "buffer zone" between y and z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary but is small enough to fit entirely within this buffer zone, then x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

So, yes, NTPP(x,z) is possible. x can be completely inside z (not touching z's boundary) while still touching y's boundary.

I think I'm pretty comfortable that the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

But wait, I think I should double check to ensure I didn't miss anything. Let me re-interpret the relations using set theory. For the sake of clarity, I'll consider x, y, and z as 2D regions.

EC(x,y) implies that:
- x and y don't have any common interior points.
- x and y have at least one boundary point in common.
- x and y are not completely disjoint.

NTPP(y,z) implies that:
- Every point of y (including its boundary) is an interior point of z.
- y is a proper subset of z, meaning y is not equal to z.

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z based on these interpretations:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z don't have any points in common. This is possible if x is entirely outside of z, even though it touches y's boundary.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z have common boundary points but no common interior points. This is possible if x extends from y's boundary to z's boundary without entering the interior of z.

Actually I was mistaken, if NTPP(y,z), then y's boundary is in the interior of z. So if x touches y's boundary, it's touching a point in the interior of z, not on the boundary of z. If EC(x,z), then x only touches z at z's boundary, but if NTPP(y,z) then y's boundary is interior to z, so touching y's boundary puts you inside z, not on z's boundary. Therefore, if EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then x cannot be EC to z, it's impossible.

Hmm, now I'm doubting my understanding. 

OK, I've been mistaken. Let me think step-by-step.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y have common boundary points but no common interior points.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper subset of z, and y's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary.

To analyze the possible relationships between x and z, I need to consider what happens to a point that's on y's boundary:

If NTPP(y,z), then y's boundary is entirely within the interior of z. It's not on z's boundary.

Now, given EC(x,y), some points of x are on y's boundary. These points are, therefore, in the interior of z. So x and z have common interior points.

This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), since both of these relations require x and z to have no common interior points.

OK, actually I'm confused now, and I think I've been making a basic error in my reasoning. Let me simplify and start over.

The relations are:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x and y have common boundary points but no common interior points.
- PO(x,y): x and y have common interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y, and x's boundary touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper subset of y, and x's boundary doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x, and y's boundary touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper subset of x, and y's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same set.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y have common boundary points but no common interior points.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper subset of z, and y's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, I'll analyze what these constraints tell us about the relationship between x and z.

If NTPP(y,z), then every point of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z. This means y's boundary is not on z's boundary; it's in the interior of z.

If EC(x,y), then x and y share boundary points. Since these boundary points of y are in the interior of z, and x contains these points, x also has points in the interior of z.

So, x has points in the interior of z. This immediately rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Now, for the remaining relations:

3. PO(x,z): If x has points outside of z and points inside z, then PO(x,z) holds. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a proper subset of z and x's boundary touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) holds. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a proper subset of z and x's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a proper subset of x and z's boundary touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) holds. But we know y is a proper subset of z, and x only touches y's boundary. It's not possible for z to be a subset of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar to the reasoning above, it's not possible for z to be a subset of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same set, then EQ(x,z) holds. But given that y is a proper subset of z and x only touches y's boundary, x and z can't be the same set. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

OK, I think I was mistaken earlier. DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible. The possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, I'm not being careful again. Let me be super explicit.

We have EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

EC(x,y) means that regions x and y are connected by a set of boundary points, but they don't have any interior points in common.

NTPP(y,z) means that region y is a proper subset of region z, and y's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary. In other words, y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

The way I'm thinking of this:
- Every point of y is an interior point of z.
- x and y share some boundary points.
- These shared boundary points, being part of y, are interior points of z.
- So, x and z share some interior points.

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z have no points in common. But we already established that x and z share some interior points (the boundary points of y that x touches). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z share only boundary points, not interior points. But we already established that x and z share some interior points (the boundary points of y that x touches). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z have common interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. If x has parts outside of z, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z, and x's boundary touches z's boundary. If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper subset of z, and x's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary. If x is entirely inside z, away from z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x, and z's boundary touches x's boundary. If y is a proper subset of z (given NTPP(y,z)) and x only touches y's boundary (given EC(x,y)), it's not possible for z to be a subset of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper subset of x, and z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary. As reasoned above, it's not possible for z to be a subset of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same set. Given that y is a proper subset of z and x only touches y's boundary, x and z can't be the same set. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Hang on, I'm still not being careful enough. Let me go relation by relation.

Recall we have EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y share boundary points but no interior points.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper subset of z and y's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary.

So y is entirely within the interior of z, including y's boundary. And x touches y only at y's boundary. This means x has some points in the interior of z (those boundary points of y that x touches).

Now let's exhaustively check each of the eight relations.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected; they don't share any points, neither boundary nor interior. But we've established that x has some points in the interior of z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z share boundary points but no interior points. But we've established that x has some points in the interior of z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z have common interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. So, x must have some parts outside of z. Given that x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, x could extend beyond z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z, and x's boundary touches z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, x could be entirely inside z and also touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z, and x's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z away from z's boundary, x could be entirely inside z and also not touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x, and z's boundary touches x's boundary. Now, if z is a proper subset of x, then all of z is inside x. But we know that y is a proper subset of z, so there are parts of z that are not in y. And since x only touches y's boundary, it's not possible for all of z to be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x, and z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, if z is a proper subset of x, then all of z is inside x. But we know that y is a proper subset of z, so there are parts of z that are not in y. And since x only touches y's boundary, it's not possible for all of z to be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same set. But given that y is a proper subset of z and x only touches y's boundary, x and z can't be the same set. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Conclusion: The possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, wait. I just realized something: If EC(x,y), then x has some points on y's boundary. But if NTPP(y,z), then y's boundary is in the interior of z. So, x has some points in the interior of z. But that doesn't mean all of x is in the interior of z. Some parts of x could be in the interior of z (the parts that touch y's boundary), and some parts could be outside of z. In fact, some parts of x could even be on z's boundary.

So let me revise my analysis.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected; they don't share any points, neither boundary nor interior. But we've established that x has some points in the interior of z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z share boundary points but no interior points. But we've established that x has some points in the interior of z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z have common interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. So, x must have some parts outside of z. Given that x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, x could extend beyond z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z, and x's boundary touches z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, x could be entirely inside z and also touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z, and x's boundary doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z away from z's boundary, x could be entirely inside z and also not touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x, and z's boundary touches x's boundary. Now, if z is a proper subset of x, then all of z is inside x. But we know that y is a proper subset of z, so there are parts of z that are not in y. And since x only touches y's boundary, it's not possible for all of z to be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x, and z's boundary doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, if z is a proper subset of x, then all of z is inside x. But we know that y is a proper subset of z, so there are parts of z that are not in y. And since x only touches y's boundary, it's not possible for all of z to be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same set. But given that y is a proper subset of z and x only touches y's boundary, x and z can't be the same set. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

My conclusion remains the same: The possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me double check to make sure I'm not missing anything.

We have EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's think about what this means more geometrically. Imagine:
- z is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle, completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. There's a "buffer zone" between y and z.
- x touches y's boundary.

Now, for each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. But if x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x shares some points with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts, then x would have to touch z's boundary. But the points where x touches y's boundary are in the interior of z, not on z's boundary. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x partially overlaps with z, then x has parts inside z and parts outside z. Since x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, x has parts inside z. If x also extends outside of z, then PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, x could be entirely inside z and also touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z away from z's boundary, x could be entirely inside z and also not touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y is inside z, and x only touches y's boundary. So, there are parts of z (away from y) that are not in x. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, there are parts of z (away from y) that are not in x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then they are the same region. But given the constraints, it's clear that x and z are different regions. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Conclusion: The possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, and NTPP.

So the answer is PO, TPP, and NTPP.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which spatial relationships are possible between x and z given that EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, I'll analyze what the given relations tell us:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
- NTPP(y,z): y is part of z but does not touch z's boundary (y is completely inside z)

Since y is completely inside z (including y's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, x must have at least some points in the interior of z. This immediately rules out two relations:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because x must share at least some points with z (where x touches y's boundary).

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because the points where x touches y are in the interior of z, not on z's boundary.

Let's check the remaining relations:

3. PO(x,z): Possible if x has some parts inside z (where it touches y) and some parts outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is completely contained in z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible because z contains y entirely, and x only touches y's boundary, so z cannot be contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because z contains y entirely while x only touches y's boundary.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
