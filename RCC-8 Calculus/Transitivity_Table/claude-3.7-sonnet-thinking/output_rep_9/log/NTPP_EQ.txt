PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the given conditions:
1. NTPP(x,y) - This means x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary. So x is completely inside y.
2. EQ(y,z) - This means y and z are coincident. They occupy exactly the same space.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given these conditions.

Since y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), anything that holds between x and y should also hold between x and z. In other words, the relationship between x and z should be the same as the relationship between x and y.

Given NTPP(x,y), and since y and z are the same (EQ(y,z)), it follows that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

To confirm this: 
- x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary (NTPP(x,y))
- y and z are the same (EQ(y,z))
- Therefore, x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(x,z))

No other relation from the RCC-8 calculus is possible given these conditions.

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z based on the given information:

1. NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)
2. EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since y and z are identical, and x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. The spatial relationship between x and y transfers directly to the relationship between x and z because z and y are coincident.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
