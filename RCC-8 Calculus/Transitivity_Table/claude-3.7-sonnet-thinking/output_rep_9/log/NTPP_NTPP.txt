PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm being asked to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between regions x and z, given that NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let's recall what NTPP means:
NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So we have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Now, what relationship can x have with z? 

Since x is completely inside y, and y is completely inside z, it follows that x must also be completely inside z. This is a transitive relationship.

The question now is whether x touches z's boundary or not. Given that x doesn't touch y's boundary and y doesn't touch z's boundary, it's impossible for x to touch z's boundary. So, x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

This corresponds to the NTPP relation in RCC-8. Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this by considering all possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because x is inside y, which is inside z.
2. EC(x,z): This would mean x touches z's boundary. This is impossible as explained above.
3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is impossible because x is completely inside z.
4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z (i.e., x touches z's boundary). As explained, this is impossible.
5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is the correct relation.
6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is impossible because z contains y, which contains x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is impossible for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal. This is impossible because z contains y, which is larger than x.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be a bit more careful with this analysis. I said that if NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). Let me confirm this is correct.

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, x is inside y, which is inside z. Clearly, x is inside z. The question is whether x touches z's boundary.

Given that x doesn't touch y's boundary and y doesn't touch z's boundary, there's a gap between x and y's boundary, and another gap between y's boundary and z's boundary. This means there's a gap between x and z's boundary, so x doesn't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, which corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is:
### Answer: NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relation can hold between x and z given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and does not touch y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary

Since x is completely inside y (without touching y's boundary), and y is completely inside z (without touching z's boundary), it follows that x must be completely inside z. Furthermore, x cannot possibly touch z's boundary because:
- x doesn't touch y's boundary
- y doesn't touch z's boundary
- Therefore, there is a "buffer zone" between x and z's boundary

This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
