PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step. We're given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they are the same region)

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent, any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that DC(x,y), meaning x and y are disconnected, and y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), it follows that x and z must also be disconnected.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me verify this more carefully:

- DC(x,y) means x and y have no common points
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are identical
- If y and z are identical, then z has exactly the same points as y
- If x has no common points with y, and z is identical to y, then x has no common points with z

So indeed, DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

The answer is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship exists between x and z given the conditions.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no parts)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (identical spatial regions)

Since y and z are identical (EQ(y,z)), z occupies exactly the same space as y. Therefore, any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Since x is disconnected from y (DC(x,y)), and z is identical to y, then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
