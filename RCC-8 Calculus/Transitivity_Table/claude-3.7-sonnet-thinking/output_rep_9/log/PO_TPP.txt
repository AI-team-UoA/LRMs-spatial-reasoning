PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the relationships and see what's possible.

We're given that:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained within the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Now we need to determine what relationship can hold between x and z.

Let's go through the possible RCC-8 relations and analyze each:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
Is this possible? We know that x partially overlaps with y, and y is contained within z. Since x and y share some spatial part, and that part of y must be within z, it seems that x and z must share at least that part. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected
Is this possible? Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y is contained within z and touches z's boundary, it's possible that x extends beyond z but touches z's boundary exactly where y does. In this case, x and z would be externally connected. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
Is this possible? Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y is contained within z, it's likely that x and z share a spatial part (the part that x shares with y). Also, since x is not fully contained within y (because PO(x,y)), and y might not fill all of z, it's possible that x is not fully contained within z. Similarly, since z fully contains y but x does not, it's likely that z is not fully contained within x. So PO(x,z) seems possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
Is this possible? If x is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) would hold. Given that x partially overlaps with y and y is a tangential proper part of z, it's possible that x is also fully contained within z and touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
Is this possible? If x is fully contained within z but does not touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) would hold. Given that x partially overlaps with y and y is a tangential proper part of z, it's possible that x is smaller than y and is fully contained within z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
Is this possible? This would mean z is fully contained within x and touches x's boundary. However, we know that y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is fully contained within z. We also know that x partially overlaps with y. For z to be fully contained within x, all of z (including the parts that don't overlap with y) would have to be within x. But if that were the case, then y would be fully contained within x, contradicting the PO(x,y) relation. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
Is this possible? Similar to the reasoning for TPPi(x,z), this would contradict the given PO(x,y) relation. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal
Is this possible? If x and z are equal, then y would be a tangential proper part of x (since TPP(y,z)). However, we're given that PO(x,y), which means y is not fully contained within x. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected
- PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Wait, let me think more carefully about EC(x,z).

We know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(y,z): y is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary.

If EC(x,z) holds, then x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. But since x partially overlaps with y, and y is fully contained within z, x and z must share at least the interior part that x shares with y. This contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider the relationships and update the list of possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible, as explained earlier.
2. EC(x,z) - Not possible, as explained now.
3. PO(x,z) - Possible.
4. TPP(x,z) - Possible.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible, as explained earlier.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible, as explained earlier.
8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible, as explained earlier.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, I just realized I may be overlooking another subtlety. Let me reconsider this more carefully again.

We're given that:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

For DC(x,z) to hold, x and z would have no common spatial parts. But since x partially overlaps with y, and y is fully contained within z, there is a part of x (the overlapping part with y) that must be within z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z would touch at a boundary but share no interior parts. Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is fully contained within z, there is a part of x (the overlapping part with y) that must be within z's interior. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z would share a spatial part, but neither would be fully contained within the other. Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is fully contained within z, x and z share a spatial part. And since x is not fully contained within y (because of PO(x,y)), it's possible that x is not fully contained within z. Similarly, since x partially overlaps with y, it's likely that x doesn't fully contain z. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would be a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is fully contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), it's possible that x is smaller than z and fully contained within it, touching z's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would be a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is fully contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), it's possible that x is smaller than z and fully contained within it without touching z's boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z would be a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is fully contained within x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is fully contained within z. If z were fully contained within x, then y would also be fully contained within x, which contradicts PO(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is fully contained within x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this would imply that y is fully contained within x, contradicting PO(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z would be equal. But if x and z are equal, then y would be a tangential proper part of x, contradicting PO(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's actually try and draw this out to confirm. 

Scenario 1: PO(x,z)
x partially overlaps with y, which is a tangential proper part of z. x extends beyond the boundary of z, but also shares a part with z (through y). This gives us PO(x,z).

Scenario 2: TPP(x,z)
x partially overlaps with y, which is a tangential proper part of z. But x is also fully contained within z and touches z's boundary. This gives us TPP(x,z).

Scenario 3: NTPP(x,z)
x partially overlaps with y, which is a tangential proper part of z. But x is also fully contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This gives us NTPP(x,z).

These scenarios seem plausible, confirming our analysis. So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Ok so to recap, the possible RCC8 relations between x and z given PO(x, y) and TPP(y, z) are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some part, but neither is contained in the other)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze the possibilities for x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible. Since x overlaps with y, and y is contained in z, x must share at least that overlapping region with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible. The part of x that overlaps with y must be in the interior of z, so x and z cannot merely touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x can partially overlap z by extending outside z's boundary while also sharing the part that overlaps with y.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. x could be completely contained in z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible. x could be completely contained within the interior of z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible. If z were contained in x, then y would be contained in x, contradicting PO(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible. Same reasoning as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x equals z, then y would be contained in x, contradicting PO(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
