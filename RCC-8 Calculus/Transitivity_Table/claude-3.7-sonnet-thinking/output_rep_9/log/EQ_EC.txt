PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that:
1. EQ(x,y) - x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
2. EC(y,z) - y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (exactly the same spatial region), x has exactly the same spatial relationship with z as y does with z.

Given that EC(y,z) - y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts - the relationship between x and z must also be EC.

So if EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), then EC(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

To double-check this:
- Since x and y are coincident (EQ), x touches z at exactly the same boundary where y touches z
- x cannot be disconnected from z because y isn't
- x cannot overlap with z because y doesn't
- x cannot be a part of z because y isn't
- z cannot be a part of x because z isn't a part of y

Therefore, EC(x,z) is the only possible answer.

ANSWER:

If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space), x must have exactly the same spatial relationship with z as y does with z.

Given that EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts, and x is equivalent to y, then x must also touch z at a boundary without sharing interior parts.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
