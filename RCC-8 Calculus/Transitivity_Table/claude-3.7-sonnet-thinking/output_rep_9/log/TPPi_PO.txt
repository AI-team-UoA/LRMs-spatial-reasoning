PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think about this problem step by step.

We are given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x, but touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): This means that y and z partially overlap. They share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

We need to determine what are the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let's analyze:

Since TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and touches x's boundary. 
Since PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? 
No, it's not possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, there must be some part of z that is also inside x. So x and z cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
Is this possible? No, it's not possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, there must be some part of z that is also inside x, which means x and z share interior parts. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Is this possible?
Yes, this is possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, there is some part of z that is inside x. But z could also have parts outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Is this possible?
No, this is not possible. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, there is some part of y that is also part of z. But y also has parts inside x that are not part of z (since PO(y,z)). Therefore, x cannot be completely inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Is this possible?
No, this is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Is this possible?
Yes, this is possible. Z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Is this possible?
Yes, this is possible. Z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. Is this possible?
No, this is not possible. Since y is properly inside x (TPPi(x,y)) and y overlaps with z but is not contained in z (PO(y,z)), z cannot be the same as x.

Wait, I think I made an error in my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let me reconsider:

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x.
If PO(y,z), then y and z partially overlap.

Let's try to visualize this: x is a larger region, y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z overlaps with y (shares some common part) but neither y nor z is completely contained in the other.

Now, could x be a proper part of z (either TPP or NTPP)? 

For TPP(x,z), x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z overlaps with y, it's hard to see how x could be completely inside z. But let me think more...

If TPPi(x,y), it means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
If PO(y,z), it means y and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other.

If z is large enough and encompasses almost all of y and all of x, then it's possible that TPP(x,z) could hold. But this would mean that the parts of y that are not part of z are precisely the parts where y touches x's boundary, which seems too specific.

For NTPP(x,z), x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This seems even more restrictive.

Let me reconsider.

Actually, I think the issue is that I'm not being rigorous enough in my reasoning. Let's try to use the formal properties of these relations.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be a tangential proper part of z.
If TPPi(x,y), then every part of y is a part of x. If PO(y,z), then y and z share some part, but y is not completely contained in z.

If TPP(x,z) were to hold, then every part of x would be a part of z. But y has parts that are parts of x but not parts of z (since PO(y,z)). So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be a non-tangential proper part of z. But again, y has parts that are parts of x but not parts of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to be the same region. But y has parts that are parts of x but not parts of z (since PO(y,z)). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me double-check these:

- PO(x,z): This means x and z share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is possible, as z could have parts that are not in x, and x could have parts that are not in z.

- TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible, as z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary.

- NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible, as z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Actually, let me think about TPPi(x,z) more carefully. 

If TPPi(x,z), then z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
If PO(y,z), then y and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.
If TPPi(x,y), then y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

So, if z is completely inside x (as required by TPPi(x,z)), and y is completely inside x, and y and z overlap but neither is contained in the other, then z could indeed be tangential to x's boundary. This is a consistent scenario.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which is also consistent with the given relations.

Now, let's think about some other possible relations between x and z:

For DC(x,z), x and z would need to be disconnected. But since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, there must be some part of z that is also inside x. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), x and z would need to touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. But again, since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, there must be some part of z that is also inside x. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

I'm pretty confident in my analysis now. The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, let me just double-check that I've been understanding the TPPi relation correctly.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of TPP, which means that x is a tangential proper part of y. So, TPPi(x,y) means that x contains y (y is a part of x), and y touches the boundary of x.

OK, so I've been understanding it correctly. TPPi(x,y) means that y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Let me think again about all the possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

For DC(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to be disconnected. But since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, there must be some part of z that is also inside x. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. But since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, there must be some part of z that is also inside x, which means x and z share interior parts. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. This is possible, as z could have parts that are not in x, and x could have parts that are not in z.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z overlaps with y but does not contain y, it's hard to see how x could be completely inside z. But let me think...

Wait, hold on. I think I've been making a mistake. Let me re-evaluate.

I've been saying that since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, then z must have some part inside x. This is correct.

But for TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z. This means every part of x is a part of z. However, since y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)) and y is not completely inside z (from PO(y,z)), there must be some part of x (specifically, a part of y) that is not in z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But again, since y is inside x and y is not completely inside z, there must be some part of x that is not in z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. This is possible, as z could be positioned such that it is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, while also overlapping with y.

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z would need to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is also possible, as z could be positioned such that it is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while also overlapping with y.

For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to be the same region. But since y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)) and y is not completely inside z (from PO(y,z)), x and z cannot be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

But actually, let me think about another possibility I may not have considered.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Let me consider the possibility of DC(x,z) (disconnected) again. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y overlaps with z, then z must have some part that overlaps with y, which is inside x. So z and x must share some part, and they cannot be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me consider the possibility of EC(x,z) (externally connected) again. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y overlaps with z, then z must have some part that overlaps with y, which is inside x. So z must have some part that is inside x, which means z and x share some interior parts. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z). For this to hold, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. Since y is inside x and touches x's boundary, if x is completely inside z, then y would also be inside z. But PO(y,z) says that y and z overlap but neither is completely contained in the other. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z) (x is a non-tangential proper part of z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But again, this would mean y is also completely inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

I think PO(x,z) (x and z partially overlap) is possible, as z could have parts that overlap with y (which is inside x) and parts that are outside x. And x could have parts (like the rest of y) that don't overlap with z.

I think TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x) is possible, as z could be positioned such that it is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, while also overlapping with y.

I think NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x) is possible, as z could be positioned such that it is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while also overlapping with y.

For EQ(x,z) (x and z are the same region) to hold, x and z would need to be the same region. But since y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)) and y is not completely inside z (from PO(y,z)), x and z cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let's consider a concrete scenario to double-check this.

Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle that is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Now, z could be:
1. A circle that overlaps with y but also extends outside of x. In this case, PO(x,z) holds.
2. A circle that is completely inside x, touches x's boundary, and overlaps with y. In this case, TPPi(x,z) holds.
3. A circle that is completely inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary, and overlaps with y. In this case, NTPPi(x,z) holds.

These all seem consistent with the given relations. So, the possible relations between x and z are indeed:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually, hold on. I think I've been too restrictive. Let's think about the EC(x,z) case more carefully.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. 

If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y overlaps with z, then z could potentially touch x at the exact point where y touches x's boundary, while the rest of z is outside of x. In this case, z would be externally connected to x. But is this consistent with PO(y,z)?

If y and z overlap, they share some common part. If this common part is just the point where y touches x's boundary, and the rest of z is outside of x, then y and z might not truly overlap in terms of sharing interior parts. I think the standard interpretation is that for regions to overlap, they need to share an interior part, not just a boundary point.

However, if z intersects with the interior of y (which would make PO(y,z) true), then z would have to have some part inside x, which would make EC(x,z) false. In other words, if z has an interior part in common with y, and y is inside x, then z must share an interior part with x.

So, I'm still convinced that EC(x,z) is not possible given the constraints.

Let me consider the other possible relations.

For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to share some interior parts, but neither is completely contained in the other. Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, z must have some part inside x, which means x and z share some interior parts. Also, since PO(y,z) means y is not completely contained in z, and y is inside x, it's possible that x is not completely contained in z. And if z extends beyond x, then z is not completely contained in x. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But since y is inside x and PO(y,z) means y is not completely inside z, x cannot be completely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But again, since y is inside x and y is not completely inside z, x cannot be completely inside z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. This is possible, as z could be positioned such that it is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, while also overlapping with y.

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z would need to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is also possible, as z could be positioned such that it is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, while also overlapping with y.

For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to be the same region. But since y is inside x and y is not completely inside z, x and z cannot be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

But let me go deeper with the EC(x,z) possibility I brought up above, where z overlaps with y on the boundary of x. In RCC-8, the standard is that regions are topologically regularized, which means that boundaries are considered part of the region. So, if two regions share a boundary point, they are considered to be connected.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Let's say y touches x's boundary at point p. If z also includes point p, then z and x are connected at that point. But this connection could be either EC(x,z) or one of the other relations like PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), etc., depending on the rest of z.

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts. If z includes point p (which is on the boundary of x) and some interior part of y, but does not extend into the interior of x beyond that part of y, then z would be partially inside x and partially outside. This would make PO(x,z) true, not EC(x,z).

For EC(x,z) to be true, z would need to be completely outside of x except for the boundary point p. But if z is overlapping with y (as required by PO(y,z)), and y is inside x (as required by TPPi(x,y)), then z must have some part inside x, which contradicts EC(x,z).

So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Let's summarize:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

And the relations DC(x,z), EC(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

Actually, wait. I just had a thought. I think my interpretation of PO(y,z) might have been too restrictive. Let me revisit that.

In RCC-8, PO(y,z) means that y and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other. This shared part could be a region with a non-empty interior.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Let's say y touches x's boundary at point p. If z overlaps with y in a way that they share a region with a non-empty interior, and this region is entirely inside x, then z must have some part inside x. This means that DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible.

However, z could extend beyond x, which would make PO(x,z) possible.

It's also possible that z is completely inside x, which would make TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) possible.

However, if z is completely inside x and y is completely inside z, then PO(y,z) would not hold (since y would be completely contained in z). So, if TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) holds, z would need to be positioned such that it is completely inside x and overlaps with y, but does not completely contain y.

What about TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)? For these to hold, x would need to be completely inside z. But since y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)) and y is not completely inside z (from PO(y,z)), x cannot be completely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to be the same region. But since y is inside x (from TPPi(x,y)) and y is not completely inside z (from PO(y,z)), x and z cannot be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

And the relations DC(x,z), EC(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

I believe this is the correct answer.

Actually, I want to double-check my reasoning for the case of DC(x,z), just to be sure.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

For DC(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to be disconnected, meaning they have no parts in common.

Since TPPi(x,y), y is completely inside x. And since PO(y,z), y and z share some common part. So, z shares some part with y, which is inside x. This means that z and x must share some part (specifically, the part that z shares with y). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's similarly double-check the case of EC(x,z).

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts.

Since TPPi(x,y), y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. And since PO(y,z), y and z share some common part, which is an interior part (because regions that only share a boundary are EC, not PO). So, z shares an interior part with y, which is inside x. This means that z and x must share an interior part (specifically, the interior part that z shares with y). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

I think I've thoroughly considered all the possibilities, and the answer remains the same. The possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Wait, I think I overlooked something. Let's consider again:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

I think I've been assuming that the part where y and z overlap must be entirely inside x. But let's consider a case where y and z overlap at a point on the boundary of x (where y touches x's boundary). In such a case, z could potentially be externally connected to x.

But, if y and z only share a boundary point, would that qualify as PO(y,z)? In RCC-8, if two regions only share a boundary, they are EC, not PO. For PO(y,z) to hold, y and z must share a region with a non-empty interior. So, if y and z overlap in a more substantial way than just a boundary point, then z must have some part inside x, which would make EC(x,z) false.

I think my original reasoning stands: EC(x,z) is not possible. And by similar logic, DC(x,z) is also not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, let me understand what these relations tell us:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap (they share some common part, but neither is completely contained in the other)

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible: Since y is inside x and y overlaps with z, some part of z must be inside x, so they cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible: Since y is inside x and partially overlaps with z, there must be some interior part of z inside x, which contradicts external connection.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible: z can have some parts inside x (where it overlaps with y) and other parts outside x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Not possible: If x were completely inside z, then y would also be completely inside z (since y is inside x), which contradicts PO(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible: Same reasoning as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible: z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary while overlapping with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible: z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary while overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible: If x and z were identical, then y would be inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
