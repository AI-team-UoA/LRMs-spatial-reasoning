PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what the relations NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) mean:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. So x is properly inside y.

PO(y,z) means that y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. So y and z overlap partially.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Since x is properly inside y, and y partially overlaps with z, there are a few possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be disconnected if x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
2. EC(x,z): x and z could touch at a boundary if x is positioned so that it just touches the boundary of the overlap between y and z.
3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap if x extends into the region where y and z overlap but also extends into a part of y that doesn't overlap with z.
4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z if x is entirely within the overlap of y and z and touches the boundary of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z if x is completely inside the overlap of y and z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let me think more carefully about each of these possibilities to see if any can be ruled out.

For DC(x,z), since x is completely inside y and y partially overlaps with z, it's possible that x is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

For EC(x,z), this would mean that x touches the boundary of z but doesn't share any interior. Since x is non-tangential to y (i.e., it doesn't touch y's boundary), and z must intersect with y's interior (due to PO(y,z)), it seems like x could potentially just touch the boundary of z where z intersects with y. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

For PO(x,z), x could extend into the region where y and z overlap but also extend into a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

For TPP(x,z), x could be entirely within the overlap of y and z and touch the boundary of z. Since x doesn't touch the boundary of y (due to NTPP(x,y)), it would touch the boundary of z where z intersects with y's interior. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPP(x,z), x could be completely inside the overlap of y and z and not touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

What about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z)? These would mean that z is a proper part of x, which seems inconsistent with the fact that x is properly inside y and y partially overlaps with z. If z were inside x, and x is inside y, then z would be inside y, which contradicts PO(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possibilities.

What about EQ(x,z)? This would mean that x and z are coincident. But since x is properly inside y and y partially overlaps with z, x and z cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But wait, let me double-check if EC(x,z) is really possible. If NTPP(x,y), then x does not touch y's boundary. If x were to externally connect with z, it would mean that x touches z only at z's boundary. But since x is strictly inside y, and y partially overlaps with z, it seems like x would either be completely disconnected from z, or it would share some interior points with z (i.e., it would overlap with z). So, I'm now thinking that EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me reconsider the possibilities:

For DC(x,z), it's clear that x can be in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z, so DC(x,z) is a possibility.

For EC(x,z), as I just argued, it doesn't seem like x can just touch z at the boundary. If x is strictly inside y, and z overlaps with y, then either x is disconnected from z, or it shares some interior with z. So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

For PO(x,z), x can overlap with z in the region where y and z overlap, so PO(x,z) is a possibility.

For TPP(x,z), x could be entirely within z and touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is positioned so that it's within the overlap of y and z and touches the boundary of the overlap. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

For NTPP(x,z), x could be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is small enough and positioned deep within the overlap of y and z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Wait, I need to reconsider TPP(x,z) again. If x is a tangential proper part of z, it means that x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But x is non-tangential to y, meaning it doesn't touch y's boundary. Now, the boundary of the overlap between y and z includes parts of y's boundary and parts of z's boundary. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary, if it touches the boundary of the overlap, it must be touching z's boundary from inside the overlap. So, TPP(x,z) seems to be a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me try to visualize this with some examples to make sure these are all the possibilities and there aren't any I've missed or incorrectly included.

Example for DC(x,z):
y is a circle, z is another circle that partially overlaps with y, and x is a small circle inside y but outside the overlap of y and z. Clearly, x and z are disconnected.

Example for PO(x,z):
y is a circle, z is another circle that partially overlaps with y, and x is a circle inside y that extends into the overlap of y and z but also extends into a part of y that doesn't overlap with z. So, x and z partially overlap.

Example for TPP(x,z):
y is a circle, z is another circle that partially overlaps with y, and x is a circle inside y that is entirely within the overlap of y and z and touches the boundary of z (but not the boundary of y, since NTPP(x,y)). So, x is a tangential proper part of z.

Example for NTPP(x,z):
y is a circle, z is another circle that partially overlaps with y, and x is a small circle inside y that is completely within the overlap of y and z and doesn't touch the boundary of either y or z. So, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

These examples confirm that DC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are all possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me re-examine the possibility for EC(x,z). If NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), then x is strictly inside y, and y partially overlaps with z. If x were to externally connect with z, it would mean that x touches z only at z's boundary. But since x is strictly inside y, and y partially overlaps with z, the only way for x to touch z's boundary is if x touches the boundary of the overlap between y and z from inside y. But the boundary of the overlap includes parts of y's boundary and parts of z's boundary. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (because NTPP(x,y)), if it touches the boundary of the overlap, it must be touching z's boundary from inside y.

So, can x touch z's boundary without sharing any interior with z? If y and z overlap, then there's a region that's both inside y and inside z. If x touches this region without entering it, then x would be touching z's boundary from inside y. This sounds like EC(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

But wait, if x touches z's boundary, it's touching a point that's both on z's boundary and inside y. Since z partially overlaps with y, a point on z's boundary could be inside y, on y's boundary, or outside y. If the point is inside y, and x touches this point, then x is touching a point that's both inside y and on z's boundary. But if this point is on z's boundary, then it's also on the boundary of the overlap between y and z. Since x is inside y and touches this point, x must be touching the boundary of the overlap between y and z from inside y.

But if x touches the boundary of the overlap from inside y, then x must be sharing some interior with z, which means it's not EC(x,z) but rather PO(x,z) or TPP(x,z).

So, after this reconsideration, I believe EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me think even more carefully about EC(x,z) to be sure.

If NTPP(x,y), then x is strictly inside y, meaning it doesn't touch y's boundary.

If PO(y,z), then y and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would share a boundary point but no interior points.

Since x is strictly inside y, any point in x is also inside y. Since PO(y,z), there's a region that's both inside y and inside z. Call this region the overlap O = y âˆ© z.

Now, for EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to share a boundary point. This point would be on the boundary of z, but since it's also in x, it's inside y. So, it's a point that's both inside y and on the boundary of z.

If a point is inside y and on the boundary of z, it's also on the boundary of the overlap O.

For x and z to be EC, x would need to touch the boundary of O from inside y but not extend into O.

But if O is the overlap of y and z, and x touches O's boundary from inside y, then x must be touching a point that's both inside y and on the boundary of z. Since x is entirely inside y, if it touches a point on the boundary of z, it's touching a point that's in both y and z, which means it's touching a point in the overlap O.

But if x touches a point in O, then x and z share an interior point, which contradicts EC(x,z).

I think the confusion here is about the nature of the boundary of the overlap. The boundary of the overlap between y and z consists of parts of y's boundary and parts of z's boundary. Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (because NTPP(x,y)), if it touches the boundary of the overlap, it must be touching z's boundary from inside y.

But if x touches z's boundary from inside y, it's touching a point that's both inside y and on the boundary of z. But a point inside y and on the boundary of z is not necessarily inside z. It could be just at the boundary of z, which means x and z could be externally connected.

So, after this thorough reconsideration, I believe EC(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

Let me try to visualize this:
Imagine y is a circle, z is another circle that partially overlaps with y, and x is a small circle inside y. The boundary of the overlap between y and z consists of parts of y's boundary and parts of z's boundary. If x is positioned so that it touches the part of z's boundary that's inside y, but doesn't extend into the overlap, then x and z are externally connected.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Hmm, let's be even more careful about EC(x,z). For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z should touch at a boundary but not share any interior parts.

Given NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
Given PO(y,z), y and z overlap, but neither is completely inside the other.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x would need to touch z's boundary but not enter z. Since x is inside y, if it touches z's boundary, it's touching a part of z's boundary that's inside y. But if a part of z's boundary is inside y, it means that z extends into y. If x touches this boundary from inside y, it's touching a point where z starts to extend into y. This point is both inside y and on the boundary of z.

However, for x and z to be externally connected, x would touch z's boundary but not extend into z. If x touches z's boundary from inside y, and z extends into y, then x would be touching the boundary of the part of z that's inside y. This boundary includes points that are both inside y and on the boundary of z. If x touches such a point, it's touching a point where z starts to extend into y.

Wait, I think I see the issue. Let me think more concretely.

Let's say we have two regions y and z that partially overlap, and a region x that's completely inside y. The overlap of y and z, denoted as O = y âˆ© z, is a region that's both inside y and inside z.

Now, the boundary of O consists of parts of y's boundary and parts of z's boundary. Specifically, it includes the parts of y's boundary that are inside z and the parts of z's boundary that are inside y.

Since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), if x touches the boundary of O, it must be touching it from inside y. Since the boundary of O includes parts of z's boundary that are inside y, if x touches these parts, it's touching z's boundary from inside y.

For x and z to be externally connected, x would touch z's boundary but not extend into z. If x touches the part of z's boundary that's inside y, but doesn't extend into z, then x and z are externally connected.

However, there's a subtlety here. If x touches the part of z's boundary that's inside y, it's touching a point that's both inside y and on the boundary of z. But a point inside y and on the boundary of z is not necessarily inside z. It could be just at the boundary of z. If x touches such a point but doesn't extend into z, then x and z are externally connected.

So, after careful consideration, I believe EC(x,z) is a possibility.

Actually, let me draw this out to make sure I'm on the right track. Let me literally draw out the regions and their boundaries to ensure I'm correct.

Alright, so we have:
- y is a region
- z is another region that partially overlaps with y
- x is a region that's completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Now, the overlap of y and z, denoted as O = y âˆ© z, is a region that's both inside y and inside z.

The boundary of O consists of parts of y's boundary and parts of z's boundary. Specifically, it includes the parts of y's boundary that are inside z and the parts of z's boundary that are inside y.

Now, for x and z to be externally connected, x would touch z's boundary but not extend into z. Since x is completely inside y, if it touches z's boundary, it's touching a part of z's boundary that's inside y. If x touches this part of z's boundary but doesn't extend into z, then x and z are externally connected.

I believe this is indeed a possibility. Let me double check with a concrete example:

Imagine y is a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.
Imagine z is a circle centered at (5,0) with radius 10.
The overlap O = y âˆ© z is the lens-shaped region that's both inside y and inside z.
Now, imagine x is a circle centered at (2,0) with radius 1.
x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
x touches the boundary of z but doesn't extend into z.
Therefore, x and z are externally connected.

So, after this thorough analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me try to see if TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) could also be possibilities, to be thorough.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a tangential proper part of x. This means z would be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), z would also need to be completely inside y. However, this contradicts PO(y,z), which states that y and z overlap but neither is completely inside the other. So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z would be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. But again, since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)), z would also need to be completely inside y, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

What about EQ(x,z)? For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would need to be the same region. But since x is completely inside y (NTPP(x,y)) and z is not completely inside y (PO(y,z)), x and z cannot be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

So, I maintain that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Ok, actually, I think I need to reconsider the possibility of EC(x,z). Let's be precise.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would share a boundary point but no interior points. 

Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Every point in x is an interior point of y.

Since PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points, but neither is completely inside the other.

For a point to be on the boundary of a region, it must be in the closure of the region but not in its interior. The boundary of z consists of points that are in the closure of z but not in the interior of z.

If x touches the boundary of z, it means there's a point that's both in x and on the boundary of z. Since every point in x is an interior point of y, this point must be both an interior point of y and on the boundary of z.

Now, can a point be both an interior point of y and on the boundary of z? Yes, it can. This happens precisely at the points where z starts to extend into y.

If x touches such a point, it's touching a point that's both inside y and on the boundary of z. But is this point inside z? No, it's on the boundary of z, which means it's not an interior point of z.

So, if x touches the boundary of z from inside y but doesn't extend into z, then x and z are externally connected, which means EC(x,z) is true.

I believe this confirms that EC(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

Just to be 100% sure, let me visualize this with a concrete example:

Imagine y is a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.
Imagine z is a circle centered at (5,0) with radius 10.
Imagine x is a circle centered at (-2,0) with radius 1.

In this setup:
- y and z overlap, but neither is completely inside the other, so PO(y,z) is true.
- x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(x,y) is true.
- x is disconnected from z, so DC(x,z) is true.

Now, if we move x to be centered at (0,0) with radius 1, then:
- x is still completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(x,y) is true.
- x touches the boundary of z but doesn't extend into z, so EC(x,z) is true.

If we move x to be centered at (2,0) with radius 1, then:
- x is still completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(x,y) is true.
- x partially overlaps with z, so PO(x,z) is true.

If we move x to be centered at (5,0) with radius 1, then:
- x is still completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(x,y) is true.
- x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, so TPP(x,z) is true.

If we move x to be centered at (5,0) with radius 0.5, then:
- x is still completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(x,y) is true.
- x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) is true.

These examples confirm that DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are all possible relationships between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z), are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z when NTPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

NTPP(x,y) means x is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
PO(y,z) means y and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other.

Given these conditions, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z) - x could be in a part of y that doesn't overlap with z
2. EC(x,z) - x could touch z's boundary from inside y
3. PO(x,z) - x could partially overlap with z
4. TPP(x,z) - x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary
5. NTPP(x,z) - x could be completely inside z without touching its boundary

The inverse relations (TPPi, NTPPi) and EQ are impossible because they would contradict the given conditions.

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
