PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let's understand what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y does not touch x's boundary. In other words, y is completely contained within the interior of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y does not touch z's boundary. In other words, y is completely contained within the interior of z.

So we have:
- y is completely contained within the interior of x (from NTPPi(x,y))
- y is completely contained within the interior of z (from NTPP(y,z))

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's consider each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know that y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. But we know y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z overlap but neither is a part of the other. This is possible. For example, x could extend beyond z in some areas, and z could extend beyond x in other areas, with y being in the common interior.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely contained within the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely contained within the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. This is possible if x and z have the same extent.

Wait, I need to re-evaluate my reasoning. Let's think more carefully about the constraints.

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely contained within the interior of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is completely contained within the interior of z.

Now, let's consider what these constraints imply for each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then they cannot share any parts, including y. But we know y is part of both x and z, so DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z only touch at their boundaries, then they cannot share any interior parts, including y. But we know y is in the interior of both x and z, so EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then there are parts of x that are not in z, and parts of z that are not in x, and parts that are in both. Since y is in the interior of both x and z, y would be in the overlap region. This scenario is consistent with our constraints, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then all of x, including y, is contained within z. This scenario is consistent with our constraints, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, then all of x, including y, is contained within the interior of z. This scenario is consistent with our constraints, so NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, then all of z, including y, is contained within x. This scenario is consistent with our constraints, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary, then all of z, including y, is contained within the interior of x. This scenario is consistent with our constraints, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, then y is contained within both. This scenario is consistent with our constraints, so EQ(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I'm not fully convinced by this analysis. Let me think through this more systematically. We have:

- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z and check if it's consistent with these constraints:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they cannot share any parts. But y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is inconsistent with our constraints.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z only touch at their boundaries, they cannot share any interior parts. But y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is inconsistent with our constraints.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then y could be in the overlap region, which is consistent with y being in the interior of both x and z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then all of x is contained within z. Since y is in the interior of x, y is also in the interior of z. This is consistent with our constraints, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, then all of x is contained within the interior of z. Since y is in the interior of x, y is also in the interior of z. This is consistent with our constraints, so NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, then all of z is contained within x. However, we know that y is in the interior of z, and y does not touch z's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, it's possible that y also touches x's boundary (if y extends all the way to the part where z touches x's boundary). But we know that y does not touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)). So, for TPPi(x,z) to be consistent with our constraints, y must not extend to the part where z touches x's boundary.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's step back and think about this geometrically.

Let's imagine these shapes. We have:
- y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
- y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. But y is inside both, so they can't be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch only at their boundaries. But y is inside both, so they can't just touch at the boundary; they must overlap. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is certainly possible. y could be in the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. y would be inside both x and z, and x would touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. This is possible. y would be inside both x and z, and x would be completely inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible. y would be inside both x and z, and z would touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary. This is possible. y would be inside both x and z, and z would be completely inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is possible. y would be inside both x and z, which are the same.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I need to think more carefully about these scenarios, especially the ones where x is part of z or z is part of x.

Let's start with TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. We know y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since x is inside z, y is also inside z. If x touches z's boundary, y might still not touch z's boundary (if y is sufficiently inside x). So TPP(x,z) is consistent with our constraints.

For NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. We know y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, y is also inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is consistent with our constraints.

For TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. We know y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since z is inside x, y is also inside x. But we also know that y doesn't touch x's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, it's still possible for y to not touch x's boundary (if y is sufficiently inside z). So TPPi(x,z) is consistent with our constraints.

For NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. We know y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is consistent with our constraints.

For EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. We know y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. If x and z are the same, then y is also inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So EQ(x,z) is consistent with our constraints.

For PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. We know y is inside both x and z, and doesn't touch the boundary of either. For PO(x,z), y would be in the overlapping region of x and z. This is consistent with our constraints, so PO(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I need to double-check one more time.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they cannot share any parts. But y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is inconsistent with our constraints.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z only touch at their boundaries, they cannot share any interior parts. But y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is inconsistent with our constraints.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then y could be in the overlap region, which is consistent with y being in the interior of both x and z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then all of x is contained within z. Since y is in the interior of x, y is also in the interior of z. This is consistent with our constraints, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, then all of x is contained within the interior of z. Since y is in the interior of x, y is also in the interior of z. This is consistent with our constraints, so NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, then all of z is contained within x. Since y is in the interior of z, y is also in the interior of x. This is consistent with our constraints, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary, then all of z is contained within the interior of x. Since y is in the interior of z, y is also in the interior of x. This is consistent with our constraints, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, then y is contained within both. This is consistent with our constraints, so EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Hmm, is there a way to rule out any of these? Let's try to visualize some specific scenarios.

Imagine y is a small circle, x is a larger circle containing y, and z is another larger circle containing y.

For PO(x,z), x and z would partially overlap, with y in the overlapping region. This is certainly possible.

For TPP(x,z), x would be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary. y would be inside x, and thus inside z. This is certainly possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be entirely inside z and not touch z's boundary. y would be inside x, and thus inside z. This is certainly possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. y would be inside z, and thus inside x. This is certainly possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be entirely inside x and not touch x's boundary. y would be inside z, and thus inside x. This is certainly possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same circle. y would be inside both. This is certainly possible.

So all of these relations are possible.

Let me double-check once more by considering the original constraints and what they imply.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

These constraints tell us that y is properly contained within both x and z, and does not touch the boundary of either. They do not place any direct constraints on the relationship between x and z.

Since y is a proper part of both x and z, x and z must at least share y, so they can't be disconnected (DC) or just touching (EC). But other than that, any relationship is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Wait, I just realized a logical constraint I missed. 

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

These relations are transitive in certain ways. For example, if NTPP(a,b) and NTPP(b,c), then NTPP(a,c). But we have a mix of NTPP and NTPPi, so we need to be careful.

Let's consider what we know about the sizes of these regions:
- Since y is a proper part of x, y is smaller than x.
- Since y is a proper part of z, y is smaller than z.

But this doesn't tell us anything about the relative sizes of x and z. x could be smaller than z, z could be smaller than x, or they could be the same size but overlap differently.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are still: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me check if there's a result from RCC-8 composition that I'm missing.

In RCC-8, the composition of two relations gives the possible relations that can hold between the first and third elements in a chain of three elements. The composition of NTPPi and NTPP would give the possible relations between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

I don't have the exact composition table for RCC-8 memorized, but based on the definitions of the relations, I believe the possible relations would still be: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me try once more from scratch. The constraints are:

- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): This means y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now, let's try to construct some visual examples to check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they cannot share any parts. But y is a part of both x and z, so this is impossible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z only touch at their boundaries, they cannot share any interior parts. But y is an interior part of both x and z, so this is impossible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, then there's a region that's part of both x and z. y could be located in this overlap region, which is consistent with y being an interior part of both x and z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then all of x is contained within z. Since y is an interior part of x, y is also an interior part of z. This is consistent with our constraints, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, then all of x is contained within the interior of z. Since y is an interior part of x, y is also an interior part of z. This is consistent with our constraints, so NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, then all of z is contained within x. Since y is an interior part of z, y is also an interior part of x. This is consistent with our constraints, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary, then all of z is contained within the interior of x. Since y is an interior part of z, y is also an interior part of x. This is consistent with our constraints, so NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, then y is contained within both. This is consistent with our constraints, so EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I realized I'm not very confident in this deduction. Let me try a specific example.

Let's say x is the unit disc and y is the disc of radius 1/3 centered at the origin. Clearly, y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,y) or equivalently NTPP(y,x) holds.

Now, let's say z is the disc of radius 2/3 centered at the origin. y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, so NTPP(y,z) holds.

In this example, z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary, so NTPPi(x,z) or equivalently NTPP(z,x) holds.

Let's try another example:

Let's say x is the unit disc and y is the disc of radius 1/3 centered at the origin. Again, NTPPi(x,y) or equivalently NTPP(y,x) holds.

Now, let's say z is the disc of radius 2 centered at the point (1, 0). y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, so NTPP(y,z) holds.

In this example, x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, so TPP(x,z) holds.

Let's try a third example:

Let's say x is the unit disc and y is the disc of radius 1/3 centered at the origin. Again, NTPPi(x,y) or equivalently NTPP(y,x) holds.

Now, let's say z is the disc of radius 1 centered at the point (1, 0). y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, so NTPP(y,z) holds.

In this example, x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z) holds.

These examples confirm that at least NTPPi, TPP, and PO are possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

For NTPP(x,z), we could have:
Let's say x is the unit disc and y is the disc of radius 1/3 centered at the origin. Again, NTPPi(x,y) or equivalently NTPP(y,x) holds.

Now, let's say z is the disc of radius 3 centered at the origin. y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, so NTPP(y,z) holds.

In this example, x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) holds.

For TPPi(x,z), we could have:
Let's say x is the unit disc and y is the disc of radius 1/3 centered at the origin. Again, NTPPi(x,y) or equivalently NTPP(y,x) holds.

Now, let's say z is the disc of radius 1/2 centered at the point (1/2, 0). y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, so NTPP(y,z) holds.

In this example, z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary, so TPPi(x,z) holds.

For EQ(x,z), we could have:
Let's say x is the unit disc and y is the disc of radius 1/3 centered at the origin. Again, NTPPi(x,y) or equivalently NTPP(y,x) holds.

Now, let's say z is also the unit disc. y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, so NTPP(y,z) holds.

In this example, x and z are the same region, so EQ(x,z) holds.

So all the relations PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are possible for the relationship between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Therefore, the final answer is: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ

ANSWER:

I need to analyze what relationships are possible between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Since y is contained within both x and z, we know that x and z must share at least the region y, so they cannot be completely disconnected (DC) or merely touching at boundaries (EC).

Let me analyze the remaining possibilities:

1. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap, with y in their shared region. This is possible.

2. TPP(x,z): x can be a proper part of z touching z's boundary, with y inside both. This is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): x can be a proper part of z not touching z's boundary. This is possible.

4. TPPi(x,z): z can be a proper part of x touching x's boundary. This is possible.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a proper part of x not touching x's boundary. This is possible.

6. EQ(x,z): x and z can be identical regions, both containing y. This is possible.
