PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We know that:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary

We need to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about the constraints:
1. EC(x,y) means x and y only share boundary points, not interior.
2. TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z (proper part) but touches z's boundary.

What are the possible relationships between x and z?

First, can x and z be disconnected (DC)? 
If y touches z's boundary and x only touches y's boundary, it's possible that x is completely outside of z, making them disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

Can x and z be externally connected (EC)?
If x touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary at the same point, then x could also touch z's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

Can x partially overlap z (PO)?
If x touches y at its boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, then x could partially enter z, creating a partial overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

Can x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)?
If y is touching z's boundary, and x is only touching y's boundary, then x could be entirely inside z while also touching z's boundary (possibly at the same point where y touches z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)?
Since x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary, it doesn't seem possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Can z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)?
If y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, it doesn't seem possible for z to be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)?
Similar to the above, this is not possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Can x and z be equal (EQ)?
Since y is a proper part of z, and x is externally connected to y, x cannot be equal to z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check these conclusions by visualizing the scenarios:

For DC(x,z):
Imagine z as a circle. y is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point. x is a circle outside of z that touches y at the boundary but doesn't intersect with z. In this case, x and z are disconnected.

For EC(x,z):
Imagine z as a circle. y is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point. x is a circle outside of z that touches y at its boundary exactly at the point where y touches z. In this case, x and z are externally connected.

For PO(x,z):
Imagine z as a circle. y is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a point. x is a circle that intersects with y at its boundary and also extends into z, creating a partial overlap with z.

For TPP(x,z):
Wait, I need to reconsider this. If x is externally connected to y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, it's hard to see how x could be entirely inside z. Let me think...

Actually, I think TPP(x,z) is not possible. If x is externally connected to y, then x has parts outside of y. Since y is inside z (touching z's boundary), for x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be entirely inside z. But that would contradict EC(x,y) because x and y would have to overlap more than just at their boundaries.

Let me review the possibilities again:

- DC(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
- EC(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
- PO(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
- TPP(x,z): Upon reconsideration, I don't think this is possible due to the constraint that EC(x,y).
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.

Hmm, let me reconsider TPP(x,z) once more:

If EC(x,y), then x and y share boundary points but no interior points. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, could x be entirely inside z (TPP(x,z))? If x only touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, then x could potentially be inside z as well. But for TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to touch z's boundary.

Let's visualize: z is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at point P. x is another circle that touches y at some point Q on y's boundary. Now, for x to be a TPP of z, x must be entirely inside z and touch z's boundary.

If Q is the same as P (the point where y touches z), then x would touch z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) possible. But if Q is not the same as P, then x might not touch z's boundary, making TPP(x,z) impossible.

But wait, even if Q is the same as P, there's another constraint: x and y are externally connected, which means they only share boundary points. For x to be entirely inside z, it would have to occupy space that y doesn't. But if x and y share only boundary points and y is already inside z, it's hard to see how x could be inside z without overlapping with y more than just at the boundary.

So, I'm still uncertain about TPP(x,z).

Let me take a different approach. Let's consider the composition table for RCC-8, which gives the possible relations between x and z given the relations between x and y, and y and z:

For EC(x,y) ∘ TPP(y,z), the possible relations are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z).

This suggests that TPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility. Let me try to understand why.

Let's visualize again: z is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at point P. x is another circle that touches y at point Q on y's boundary.

If Q is the same as P, then x would touch z's boundary. And if x is small enough, it could be entirely inside z, making TPP(x,z) possible.

But still, I'm not sure if this is consistent with EC(x,y). If x is entirely inside z and y is also inside z, how can x and y only share boundary points?

Wait, I think I was overthinking this. Let's imagine z as a large square, y as a smaller square inside z that touches z's boundary, and x as an even smaller square inside z that only touches y at the boundary and also touches z's boundary. In this configuration, EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) hold, and x is a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, that doesn't work either, because if x is inside z and y is inside z, and x is "even smaller", it wouldn't just touch y at the boundary -- they'd overlap more.

Let's step back and use the composition table for RCC-8, which is a well-established result in qualitative spatial reasoning. For EC(x,y) ∘ TPP(y,z), the possible relations are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z).

I'll try again to see why TPP(x,z) is possible.

Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at point P. Now, imagine x as an even smaller circle that touches y at a different point Q on y's boundary (not P). If x is positioned in such a way that it's entirely inside z and also touches z's boundary at a point R (different from P), then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

But this still doesn't work with EC(x,y) because if x and y are both inside z and touch at a boundary, then either x is inside y, y is inside x, or they partially overlap.

I think I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the definition of EC.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This doesn't necessarily mean they both have to be circles or squares. They could be any shape.

Let's try a different visualization: z is a large rectangle, y is an "L"-shaped region inside z that touches z's boundary, and x is a rectangle outside of z that touches y at the corner of the "L" (which is on y's boundary but not on z's boundary). In this case, x and y are externally connected, y is a tangential proper part of z, but x and z are disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

Let's try another: z is a large rectangle, y is an "L"-shaped region inside z that touches z's boundary at point P, and x is a rectangle that touches y at the corner of the "L" (which is on y's boundary but not on z's boundary) and also touches z's boundary at point P. In this case, x and y are externally connected, y is a tangential proper part of z, and x and z are externally connected. So EC(x,z) is possible.

Let's try for PO: z is a large rectangle, y is an "L"-shaped region inside z that touches z's boundary at point P, and x is a rectangle that touches y at the corner of the "L" (which is on y's boundary but not on z's boundary) and partially enters z. In this case, x and y are externally connected, y is a tangential proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

But I'm still struggling to find a configuration where TPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, looking more carefully at the RCC-8 composition table, for EC(x,y) ∘ TPP(y,z), the possible relations are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Let me try to visualize TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z):

For TPP(x,z): z is a large rectangle, y is a smaller rectangle inside z that touches z's boundary, and x is a small region inside y that touches y's boundary. But, if x is inside y and y is inside z, then x would be inside z. And if x touches y's boundary, it might also touch z's boundary at the same point y does, making TPP(x,z) possible.

Hmm but the problem now is with EC(x,y). If x is inside y, then they would overlap, contradicting EC(x,y).

Wait, I just realized an important misconception. If EC(x,y), it doesn't mean x is outside of y. It means they touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.

Let's reconsider with this in mind:

For TPP(x,z): z is a large rectangle, y is a smaller rectangle inside z that touches z's boundary at point P, and x is another rectangle inside z that touches y's boundary at point Q (which is not P) and also touches z's boundary at a different point R. In this case, x and y are externally connected, y is a tangential proper part of z, and x is a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z): z is a large rectangle, y is a smaller rectangle inside z that touches z's boundary, and x is a small rectangle inside z (but not overlapping with y) that doesn't touch z's boundary. In this case, x and y are disconnected, y is a tangential proper part of z, and x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But this doesn't work because we know EC(x,y).

Actually, I think NTPP(x,z) is not possible given the constraints. If EC(x,y), then x touches y's boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y touches z's boundary. Now, for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)), x would have to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x would either touch z's boundary or not be inside z at all, unless x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is not on z's boundary. In that case, x could be inside z without touching z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) possible.

Alright, let's be systematic. Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's enumerate the possibilities for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is outside of z and only touches y at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x is outside of z and touches y at a point on y's boundary that's also on z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x is partially inside and partially outside of z, and touches y at some point on y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y's boundary at a point that's not on z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is inside z, doesn't touch z's boundary, and touches y's boundary at a point that's not on z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. Given TPP(y,z), y is inside z. Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary. For z to be inside x, x would have to envelop y, which seems inconsistent with EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to TPPi(x,z), this doesn't seem possible for the same reasons.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. Given TPP(y,z), y is a proper part of z, which means y is smaller than z. Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary. For x to be equal to z, x would have to envelop y, which seems inconsistent with EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Wait, I think I'm overthinking this. I've been assuming that EC means the entities are "outside" of each other, but that's not necessarily the case. EC means they touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.

Let's try another approach. Consider a scenario where y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x is outside of z but touches y at the same point where y touches z. In this case, x and y would be externally connected (EC(x,y)), y would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x and z would be externally connected (EC(x,z)).

Now, consider a scenario where y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x is outside of z and doesn't touch z but touches y at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary. In this case, x and y would be externally connected (EC(x,y)), y would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x and z would be disconnected (DC(x,z)).

Next, consider a scenario where y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x partially overlaps with z and touches y at a point on y's boundary. In this case, x and y would be externally connected (EC(x,y)), y would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x and z would partially overlap (PO(x,z)).

For TPP(x,z), consider a scenario where y is inside z and touches z's boundary at point P, and x is inside z and touches z's boundary at point Q (which is different from P) and also touches y at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary. In this case, x and y would be externally connected (EC(x,y)), y would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

For NTPP(x,z), consider a scenario where y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, and touches y at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary. In this case, x and y would be externally connected (EC(x,y)), y would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x would be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible given the constraints.

Actually, let me think about this more. Imagine we have EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z). Can we have TPPi(x,z), meaning that z is a tangential proper part of x?

If y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and z is inside x and touches x's boundary, then y would also be inside x. Now, for EC(x,y) to hold, x and y would have to touch at a boundary without sharing interior points. But if y is inside x, they would share interior points, contradicting EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), if z is inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would also be inside x without touching x's boundary. This contradicts EC(x,y), so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are coincident, then y would be inside x and touching x's boundary. This contradicts EC(x,y), so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Now, let me double-check NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at a boundary without sharing interior points. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. 

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x must be inside z without touching z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary (due to EC(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (due to TPP(y,z)), how can x be inside z without touching z's boundary?

Wait, the point where x touches y's boundary doesn't have to be the same point where y touches z's boundary. So, x could touch y at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) possible.

Let's recount:
- DC(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
- EC(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
- PO(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
- TPP(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
- NTPP(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check NTPP(x,z) one more time. For NTPP(x,z) to hold, x must be inside z without touching z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary (due to EC(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (due to TPP(y,z)), then there seems to be a path from x to z's boundary via y. But for NTPP(x,z), x should not touch z's boundary.

However, "touching" in the RCC-8 calculus means sharing boundary points. Just because x touches y's boundary and y touches z's boundary doesn't mean x touches z's boundary. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary, and x is inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So, after careful consideration, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I'm more confident in this answer now. Now, let me double-check it against the RCC-8 composition table to make sure:

The composition table for RCC-8 for EC(x,y) ∘ TPP(y,z) should give us the possible relations between x and z.

For EC(x,y) ∘ TPP(y,z), the composition table gives: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Great, this matches my reasoning. So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relations can hold between x and z when we know that EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me analyze the possible scenarios:

1. **DC(x,z)** (disconnected): 
   This is possible when x touches y at a point on y's boundary that is not where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x remains completely outside z.

2. **EC(x,z)** (externally connected):
   This occurs when x touches y precisely at the point where y touches z's boundary. In this configuration, x touches z's boundary but shares no interior with z.

3. **PO(x,z)** (partially overlapping):
   This is possible when x extends partially into z while touching y at its boundary. Part of x is inside z, and part is outside.

4. **TPP(x,z)** (tangential proper part):
   This can occur when x is completely inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y at some point on y's boundary.

5. **NTPP(x,z)** (non-tangential proper part):
   This happens when x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still touching y at a point on y's boundary that is not on z's boundary.

The inverse relations (TPPi, NTPPi) and EQ are not possible given the constraints.
