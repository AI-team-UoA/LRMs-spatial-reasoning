PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this. If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), then x and y are disconnected, and y and z are disconnected. I want to determine what are the possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected, they share no spatial parts.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, they share no spatial parts.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, let's consider all eight of the RCC-8 relations:
1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Now, let's analyze which of these are possible:

1. DC(x,z): This is certainly possible. We can place x, y, and z all disconnected from each other.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. Even though x and y are disconnected, and y and z are disconnected, x and z could still touch at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z could overlap partially, while both being disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x could be a tangential proper part of z, while both are disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, while both are disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be a tangential proper part of x, while both are disconnected from y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x, while both are disconnected from y.

8. EQ(x,z): This is possible. x and z could be coincident, while both are disconnected from y.

In fact, I can't rule out any of the eight relations between x and z based on the given conditions. All eight are possible.

Actually, let me double-check if EQ(x,z) is possible when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

If EQ(x,z), then x and z are coincident, meaning they occupy the same space. If DC(x,y), then x and y are disconnected. Since x and z are coincident, z and y should also be disconnected, which is consistent with DC(y,z). So yes, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, all eight relations are possible:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me just think through a couple of concrete examples to double-check a few of these:

1. DC(x,z):
   Imagine x as a circle on the left, z as a circle on the right, and y as a circle far away from both. Here, x and z are disconnected, and both are disconnected from y.

2. EC(x,z):
   Imagine x and z as circles that touch at a point, and y as a circle far away from both. Here, x and z touch at a boundary (EC), and both are disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z):
   Imagine x and z as overlapping circles, and y as a circle far away from both. Here, x and z partially overlap, and both are disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z):
   Imagine x as a circle inside z, touching z's boundary, and y as a circle far away from both. Here, x is a tangential proper part of z, and both are disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   Imagine x as a circle inside z, not touching z's boundary, and y as a circle far away from both. Here, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and both are disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   Imagine z as a circle inside x, touching x's boundary, and y as a circle far away from both. Here, z is a tangential proper part of x, and both are disconnected from y.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   Imagine z as a circle inside x, not touching x's boundary, and y as a circle far away from both. Here, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, and both are disconnected from y.

8. EQ(x,z):
   Imagine x and z as coincident circles, and y as a circle far away from both. Here, x and z are coincident, and both are disconnected from y.

All of these are valid configurations, so all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

So, the answer is: all of the RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ.

Actually, let me be more careful with the EQ(x,z) case. If x and z are equal, and x is disconnected from y, then z must also be disconnected from y. This is given as DC(y,z), so that's consistent.

So, I confirm that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for the relation between x and z when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z). These are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given that DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

When two regions x and y are disconnected (DC), they share no spatial parts. Similarly, y and z share no spatial parts.

For x and z, the following scenarios are all possible:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be completely disconnected from each other
2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z
6. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,z): x and z can be equal

In every case, we can position y to be disconnected from both x and z, satisfying the given conditions.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
