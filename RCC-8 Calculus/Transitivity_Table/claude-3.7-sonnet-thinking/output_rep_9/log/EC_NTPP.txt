PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this situation:

1) EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share interior parts.

2) NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Now I need to determine what spatial relation(s) can hold between x and z.

Since y is completely contained within z (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches only the boundary of y (EC(x,y)), x must have some relationship with z.

Let's go through the possibilities:

1) DC(x,z) - Is it possible for x to be disconnected from z? 
   If y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, then x must at least touch z or overlap with it. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2) EC(x,z) - Is it possible for x to externally connect with z?
   If x touches the boundary of y, and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x must either be partially inside z or completely inside z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3) PO(x,z) - Is it possible for x to partially overlap with z?
   Yes, this seems possible. If x touches the boundary of y, and y is completely inside z, then x could partially extend inside z (where it touches y) and partially extend outside z.

4) TPP(x,z) - Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, this seems possible. If x touches the boundary of y but is completely contained within z while touching z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) would hold.

5) NTPP(x,z) - Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, this seems possible. If x touches the boundary of y and is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) would hold.

6) TPPi(x,z) - Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x?
   If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z would be inside x and touch x's boundary. But we know that y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x only touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)). This would mean x contains z, which contains y, but x only touches y's boundary. This seems contradictory. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7) NTPPi(x,z) - Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   Similar to the reasoning for TPPi, this would create a contradiction. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8) EQ(x,z) - Is it possible for x and z to be equal?
   If x and z are equal, then y would be inside x (since NTPP(y,z)). But we know that x only touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), so y cannot be inside x. This is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to reconsider some of these. Let me think more carefully.

Actually, I need to visualize this situation more clearly. 

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Now let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1) DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since x touches y's boundary and y is inside z, at least part of x must be inside or touching z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2) EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, this means x must at least partially enter z to touch y. So x and z can't just touch at their boundaries. EC(x,z) is not possible.

3) PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is possible. x could touch y's boundary from both inside and outside of z, resulting in x partially overlapping with z.

4) TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and is otherwise contained within z, touching z's boundary at some point.

5) NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and is otherwise completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6) TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But if z contains y (NTPP(y,z)), and x only touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7) NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. As with TPPi, this is not possible given the constraints.

8) EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal. But if x and z are equal, and y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), then y would be inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y), which says x and y only touch at their boundaries. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, this is still not satisfying me. Let me re-think this from the beginning.

Actually, I think I'm not visualizing this correctly. Let's break it down very clearly:

1. EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries.
2. NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Now, the key insight is that if y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, then x must intersect with z in some way.

Let's go through the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This isn't possible because if x touches y's boundary and y is inside z, then x must at least touch or overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z only touch at their boundaries. Is this possible? If y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary) and x touches y's boundary, then part of x must be inside z. So x and z can't just touch at their boundaries. EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. x could touch y's boundary from the inside of z, and extend outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. x could be completely inside z, touching z's boundary, and also touching y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. x could be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, but touching y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible. If z contains y completely (NTPP(y,z)), and x only touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then z can't be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This isn't possible. If x and z are equal, and y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), then y would be inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y), which says x and y only touch at their boundaries.

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me just double-check these.

PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. If x touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of z, then PO(x,z) holds.

TPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary and is otherwise contained within z, touching z's boundary at some point, then TPP(x,z) holds.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary and is otherwise completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

Actually, now I'm unsure about NTPP(x,z) again. Let me think this through once more.

NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

Actually, yes, this is possible. If y is well inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is also well inside z but touches y's boundary, then x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me reason this through one more time.

Actually, I think my original assessment was correct. Let's reconsider NTPP(x,z).

NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

Yes, this is possible. Imagine y as a smaller circle completely inside a larger circle z, and x as a circle that touches y's boundary but is also completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

Actually, let's make sure that DC(x,z) is not possible.

DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected. If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can x be disconnected from z?

No, this isn't possible. If x touches y's boundary and y is inside z, then x must at least touch or overlap with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let's double-check EC(x,z).

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping. If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can x touch z's boundary without overlapping with z?

No, this isn't possible. If y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary) and x touches y's boundary, then part of x must be inside z. So x and z can't just touch at their boundaries. EC(x,z) is not possible.

Let's double-check TPPi(x,z).

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can z be completely inside x and touch x's boundary?

Actually, I think I need to be more precise about what EC(x,y) means. It means x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share any interior points. So x is completely outside of y, but they touch at their boundaries.

Given this, if y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x is completely outside of y but touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can z be completely inside x and touch x's boundary?

No, this isn't possible. If z contains y completely (NTPP(y,z)), and x is outside of y but touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then z can't be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let's double-check NTPPi(x,z).

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x is outside of y but touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can z be completely inside x without touching x's boundary?

No, this isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi. If z contains y completely (NTPP(y,z)), and x is outside of y but touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then z can't be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let's double-check EQ(x,z).

EQ(x,z) means x and z are equal. If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x is outside of y but touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can x and z be equal?

No, this isn't possible. If x and z are equal, and y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), then y would be inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y), which says x is outside of y but touches y's boundary. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm starting to doubt that TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible. Let me think about it again.

TPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x is outside of y but touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can x be completely inside z and touch z's boundary?

Actually, this is possible. If y is inside z but not touching z's boundary, and x is a region that touches y's boundary and extends to touch z's boundary but is still completely inside z, then TPP(x,z) holds.

NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x is outside of y but touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can x be completely inside z without touching z's boundary?

This is also possible. If y is well inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x is a region that touches y's boundary but is also well inside z (not touching z's boundary), then NTPP(x,z) holds.

But let's consider another case: what if x touches y's boundary but is mostly outside of z? In this case, x would partially overlap with z, which corresponds to PO(x,z).

So it seems like the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check whether x can touch the boundary of y from outside of z, since y is not touching the boundary of z.

Hmm, since NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means there's a "buffer" zone between y and the boundary of z. If x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then x must be at least partly inside this buffer zone, which means it's inside z.

But does x have to be completely inside z? Not necessarily. It could extend beyond z, in which case PO(x,z) would hold.

If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) would hold.

If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) would hold.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

However, I'm not 100% confident because I keep changing my mind. Let me be more methodical and visualize specific examples:

1. Imagine z as a big circle, y as a small circle inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x as a shape that touches y's boundary. 

   1a. If x extends beyond z's boundary, then x and z partially overlap, so PO(x,z) holds.
   
   1b. If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z, so TPP(x,z) holds.
   
   1c. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so NTPP(x,z) holds.

So, based on these examples, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me also try to reason more abstractly using the definitions of these relations:

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.
NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

We need to find the possible relations between x and z.

Since y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), x must have some intersection with z. 

For each of the RCC-8 relations, let's determine if it could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This isn't possible because if x touches y's boundary and y is inside z, then x must at least touch or overlap with z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping. This isn't possible. If y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary) and x touches y's boundary, then part of x must be inside z. So x and z can't just touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and is otherwise contained within z, touching z's boundary at some point.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and is otherwise completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This isn't possible. If z contains y completely (NTPP(y,z)), and x is outside of y but touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then z can't be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This isn't possible. If x and z are equal, and y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), then y would be inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y), which says x is outside of y but touches y's boundary.

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

That's the third time I've arrived at the same answer, so I'm now quite confident.

Actually, let me ensure this is rigorous by using the properties of the RCC-8 calculus:

- EC(x,y) means that x and y have no common interior points, but their boundaries intersect.
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and does not share any boundary points with z.

From these, we want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Given that y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)) and x touches the boundary of y but is otherwise outside of y (EC(x,y)), the possible scenarios are:

1. x extends outside of z, in which case x and z partially overlap: PO(x,z).
2. x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary: TPP(x,z).
3. x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary: NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relation is possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, hang on, let me rigorously check my previous reasoning:

1. DC(x,z): Disconnected. If x touches y's boundary and y is inside z, then x must at least touch or overlap with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): External connection. Actually, I'm not 100% sure that this is impossible. Let me reconsider.

If y is completely inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), can x touch z's boundary without overlapping with z?

Actually, this might be possible. If x touches y's boundary at a point, and x also touches z's boundary at a point, and x is otherwise outside of z, then EC(x,z) could hold.

Hmm, but since NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. There's a "buffer" zone between y and the boundary of z. If x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then x must be at least partly inside this buffer zone, which means it's inside z.

But if x touches y's boundary at a point and is otherwise outside of z, then EC(x,z) would not hold because x would have to overlap with z at least a bit to reach y's boundary.

Wait, let me reason this through more carefully. 

Let's go back to basics:
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

If y doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then at the point where x touches y's boundary, x is inside z because y and its boundary are inside z.

So x and z share at least some interior points. This means EC(x,z) is not possible because EC requires that x and z have no common interior points.

3. PO(x,z): Partial overlap. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): Tangential proper part. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and is otherwise contained within z, touching z's boundary at some point.

5. NTPP(x,z): Non-tangential proper part. This is possible if x touches y's boundary and is otherwise completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Inverse tangential proper part. If z contains y completely (NTPP(y,z)), and x is outside of y but touches y's boundary (EC(x,y)), then z can't be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Inverse non-tangential proper part. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Equal. If x and z are equal, and y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), then y would be inside x. This contradicts EC(x,y), which says x is outside of y but touches y's boundary. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm still worried about my reasoning for EC(x,z). Let me be even more rigorous.

EC(x,z) means that x and z have no common interior points, but their boundaries intersect. Could this happen given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z)?

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. So x is outside of y but touches y's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. So both y and its boundary are inside z (not touching z's boundary).

If x touches y's boundary, and y's boundary is inside z, then x must enter z to touch y's boundary. This means x and z share interior points, which contradicts the definition of EC(x,z).

So EC(x,z) is not possible.

OK so we have:
The possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I'm going to use the precise definitions of the RCC-8 relations and trace through each scenario once more to make sure:

- DC(a,b): The topological closures of a and b are disjoint.
- EC(a,b): The topological closures of a and b share points, but their interiors do not.
- PO(a,b): The interiors of a and b share points, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(a,b): The interior and closure of a are each a subset of the interior and closure of b, respectively, but the closure of a shares points with the boundary of b.
- NTPP(a,b): The interior and closure of a are each a subset of the interior and closure of b, respectively, and the closure of a does not share points with the boundary of b.
- TPPi(a,b): TPP(b,a)
- NTPPi(a,b): NTPP(b,a)
- EQ(a,b): a and b have the same interior and closure.

Given EC(x,y), the topological closures of x and y share points, but their interiors do not. So the interior of x is disjoint from both the interior and boundary of y, but the boundary of x shares points with the boundary of y.

Given NTPP(y,z), both the interior and closure of y are subsets of the interior of z. So both y and its boundary are inside the interior of z.

Now let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean the closures of x and z are disjoint. But since the boundary of x touches the boundary of y, and the boundary of y is inside the interior of z, the closure of x must share points with the interior of z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean the closures of x and z share points, but their interiors do not. But as we established, the boundary of x (which is part of the closure of x) touches the boundary of y, which is inside the interior of z. So the closure of x shares points with the interior of z, which contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean the interiors of x and z share points, but neither is a subset of the other. If x touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of z, then PO(x,z) would hold. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean the interior and closure of x are each a subset of the interior and closure of z, respectively, but the closure of x shares points with the boundary of z. If x touches y's boundary, is completely inside z, and also touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) would hold. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean the interior and closure of x are each a subset of the interior and closure of z, respectively, and the closure of x does not share points with the boundary of z. If x touches y's boundary and is otherwise completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) would hold. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean TPP(z,x), i.e., z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But if y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary but is otherwise outside of y (EC(x,y)), then z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean NTPP(z,x), i.e., z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z have the same interior and closure. If y is inside z (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary but is otherwise outside of y (EC(x,y)), then x and z cannot be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I'm going to try one more time, drawing from a concrete example.

Imagine:
- z is a large circle
- y is a small circle inside z, not touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z))
- x is a shape that touches y's boundary but does not overlap with y (EC(x,y))

Given this setup, what are the possible relations between x and z?

1. If x extends outside of z, then x and z partially overlap, giving us PO(x,z).
2. If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z, giving us TPP(x,z).
3. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, giving us NTPP(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relation is possible in this scenario.

So the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I'm satisfied with this answer.

Checking through once more:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

From these, the possible relations between x and z are:

- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z based on the given conditions.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but do not share interior points.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Let me analyze the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible. Since x touches y's boundary, and y is completely inside z, x must intersect with z in some way.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible. Since y's boundary is entirely inside the interior of z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, x must share interior points with z.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x can touch y's boundary and extend both inside and outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be completely inside z, touch y's boundary, and also touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be completely inside z, touch y's boundary, but not touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible. If y is inside z, and x only touches y's boundary, then z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x and z were equal, y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
