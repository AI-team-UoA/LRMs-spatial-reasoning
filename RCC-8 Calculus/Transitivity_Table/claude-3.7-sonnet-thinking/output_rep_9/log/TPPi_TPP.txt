PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

First, let's understand what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is contained in z and touches z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is contained in x and touches x's boundary
- y is contained in z and touches z's boundary

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This doesn't seem possible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the region y, meaning they can't be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interiors.
   This doesn't seem possible either because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the interior region of y, not just their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, then x and z could share y and maybe some additional regions, but neither is fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of x and z, and x is also a tangential proper part of z, then the containment hierarchy is y ⊂ x ⊂ z, with each touching the boundary of the next.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This doesn't seem immediately obvious, but let's think: If y touches the boundary of x and y also touches the boundary of z, then it seems like x must also touch the boundary of z. But actually, it's possible that y touches the boundary of x at a point that is not on the boundary of z, and y touches the boundary of z at a different point. In this case, x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, making x an NTPP of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. If y is a tangential proper part of z and z is a tangential proper part of x, then the containment hierarchy is y ⊂ z ⊂ x, with each touching the boundary of the next.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to NTPP, this is possible if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, even though y touches both their boundaries.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This is possible if both x and z are the same region, with y as a tangential proper part of both.

Let me double-check this reasoning.

Actually, I think I need to be more precise about what it means for y to be a tangential proper part of both x and z. 

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x (y ⊂ x) and y touches the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z (y ⊂ z) and y touches the boundary of z.

Given these two relations, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Let's think about it spatially. We have y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, so y is in the intersection of x and z. 

But that doesn't fully constrain the relationship between x and z. They could be related in several ways:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends outside of z in some parts, and z extends outside of x in other parts.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y touches x's boundary and z's boundary, it's plausible that x touches z's boundary at the same point.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This seems possible if y touches x's boundary at a point that's inside z, and y touches z's boundary at a different point.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This seems possible if y touches z's boundary at a point that's inside x, and y touches x's boundary at a different point.

6. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is possible if x and z are the same region.

So it seems the possible relations are PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

But wait, let me think more about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). These mean z is a part of x. But we also know that y is a part of z (from TPP(y,z)). So we'd have y ⊂ z ⊂ x.

Given TPPi(x,y) or equivalently TPP(y,x), we know y ⊂ x. So the containment y ⊂ z ⊂ x is consistent with what we know.

For TPPi(x,z), z would touch x's boundary. Given that y touches z's boundary and y touches x's boundary, it's plausible that z touches x's boundary at the same point where y touches both.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This seems possible if y touches z's boundary at a point that's inside x, and y touches x's boundary at a different point.

So I think TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are both possible.

What about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z)? These mean x is a part of z. But we also know that y is a part of x (from TPPi(x,y) or TPP(y,x)). So we'd have y ⊂ x ⊂ z.

We already know y ⊂ z (from TPP(y,z)), so the containment y ⊂ x ⊂ z is consistent with what we know.

For TPP(x,z), x would touch z's boundary. Given that y touches x's boundary and y touches z's boundary, it's plausible that x touches z's boundary at the same point where y touches both.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This seems possible if y touches x's boundary at a point that's inside z, and y touches z's boundary at a different point.

So I think TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are both possible.

What about PO(x,z)? This means x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. We know y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, so y is in the overlap of x and z. PO requires that x extends beyond z in some parts, and z extends beyond x in other parts. This doesn't contradict anything we know, so PO(x,z) is possible.

What about EQ(x,z)? This means x and z are the same region. We know y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, which is consistent with x = z. And we know y touches the boundary of both x and z, which is also consistent with x = z. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

What about DC(x,z) and EC(x,z)? Both of these mean x and z don't share any interior points. But we know y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the interior of y. So DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, wait. Let me think more carefully about this.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x (y ⊂ x and y ≠ x)
- y touches the boundary of x

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is a proper part of z (y ⊂ z and y ≠ z)
- y touches the boundary of z

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's consider each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, then x and z must share at least the region y, so they can't be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interiors.
   Again, if y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, then x and z share at least the interior of y, not just their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This means x and z share some points, but each has points not in the other. We know they share at least the region y. For PO to hold, x must have points not in z, and z must have points not in x. There's nothing in our given information that contradicts this, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and x touches the boundary of z. Given that y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of z, it's plausible that x touches the boundary of z at the same point where y touches it. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. Given that y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of z, it seems like x should also touch the boundary of z wherever y does. So at first glance, NTPP(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

   But let's think more carefully. The fact that y touches the boundary of x doesn't mean that every part of the boundary of x is touched by y. And the fact that y touches the boundary of z doesn't mean that every part of the boundary of z is touched by y. So it's possible that the part of the boundary of x that y touches is not on the boundary of z, and the part of the boundary of z that y touches is not on the boundary of x. In this case, x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

   So actually, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and z touches the boundary of x. Given that y ⊂ z and y touches the boundary of x, it's plausible that z touches the boundary of x at the same point where y touches it. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This means z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and z does not touch the boundary of x. Given that y ⊂ z and y touches the boundary of x, it seems like z should also touch the boundary of x wherever y does. So at first glance, NTPPi(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

   But using the same reasoning as for NTPP, it's possible that the part of the boundary of x that y touches is not on the boundary of z, and the part of the boundary of z that y touches is not on the boundary of x. In this case, z could be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

   So actually, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This means x = z. Given that y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, and y touches the boundaries of both x and z, there's nothing contradicting x = z. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think I may need to reconsider NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). 

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But we know y touches z's boundary and y is part of x. So how can x not touch z's boundary? The only way this would be possible is if y touches z's boundary from the outside of x, but this contradicts y being a part of x. So I think NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), we need z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But we know y touches x's boundary and y is part of z. So how can z not touch x's boundary? The only way this would be possible is if y touches x's boundary from the outside of z, but this contradicts y being a part of z. So I think NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, no, I'm being careless. Let me be more precise and imagine concrete examples.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. Let's say y is a small disc, x is a slightly larger disc that contains y, and z is an even larger disc that contains x. y touches the boundary of x, and y also touches the boundary of z. But it's possible for x to be fully inside z without touching z's boundary, as long as the point where y touches the boundary of z is not also on the boundary of x. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), we need z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Let's say y is a small disc, z is a slightly larger disc that contains y, and x is an even larger disc that contains z. y touches the boundary of z, and y also touches the boundary of x. But it's possible for z to be fully inside x without touching x's boundary, as long as the point where y touches the boundary of x is not also on the boundary of z. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So I think the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I'm realizing I need to be even more careful. Let me try to draw out the scenarios more precisely.

For TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is fully inside x and touches x's boundary at least at one point.

For TPP(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully inside z and touches z's boundary at least at one point.

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Imagine y is a small disc. x is a larger disc that contains y, with y touching the boundary of x. z is another larger disc that contains y, with y touching the boundary of z. x and z overlap at y and possibly more, but x has parts outside z, and z has parts outside x. This satisfies TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and PO(x,z), so PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Imagine y is a small disc. x is a larger disc that contains y, with y touching the boundary of x. z is an even larger disc that contains x, with y touching the boundary of z at the same point where it touches the boundary of x. This satisfies TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and TPP(x,z), so TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This one is tricky. We need x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But we also need y to touch the boundary of z. I think what would work is for y to extend radially to the boundary of z, but the boundary of x is circular and doesn't extend as far. This way, y touches the boundary of z, but x doesn't. Does this satisfy TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z)?

   TPPi(x,y) means y is fully inside x and touches x's boundary. In this scenario, y is fully inside x and touches x's boundary, so this is satisfied.

   TPP(y,z) means y is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. In this scenario, y is fully inside z and touches z's boundary, so this is satisfied.

   So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Imagine y is a small disc. z is a larger disc that contains y, with y touching the boundary of z. x is an even larger disc that contains z, with y touching the boundary of x at the same point where it touches the boundary of z. This satisfies TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and TPPi(x,z), so TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to NTPP, we need z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But we also need y to touch the boundary of x. Again, I think what would work is for y to extend radially to the boundary of x, but the boundary of z is circular and doesn't extend as far. This way, y touches the boundary of x, but z doesn't. This satisfies TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z), so NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   Imagine y is a small disc. x and z are the same larger disc that contains y, with y touching the boundary of x/z. This satisfies TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and EQ(x,z), so EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

So I think the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, hold on. I think I may have been overthinking this. I'm not sure if I can just use "imagine scenarios" to determine the possible relations. Let me be more systematic.

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), what are the possible relationships between x and z?

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y ⊂ x, y ≠ x, and y touches the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y ⊂ z, y ≠ z, and y touches the boundary of z.

From these, we know y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, so y is in the intersection of x and z. But this doesn't fully determine the relationship between x and z.

Let's consider each RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Given y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, x and z share at least the region y, so they can't be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interiors.
   Given y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, x and z share at least the interior of y, not just their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This means x and z share some points, but each has points not in the other. We know they share at least the region y. For PO to hold, x must have points not in z, and z must have points not in x. There's nothing in our given information that contradicts this, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and x touches the boundary of z. There's nothing in our given information that contradicts this, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. But given that y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of z, x should also touch the boundary of z wherever y does. So it doesn't seem like NTPP(x,z) is possible.

   Actually, I think I need to be more careful here. Let's think more clearly. The fact that y touches the boundary of z doesn't mean that every part of y touches the boundary of z. And the fact that y is part of x doesn't mean that x touches the boundary of z at the same point where y does. But then again, if some part of y touches the boundary of z, and y is fully contained in x, then that part of y is also part of x, which means x touches the boundary of z at that point.

   So I don't think NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and z touches the boundary of x. There's nothing in our given information that contradicts this, so TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This means z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and z does not touch the boundary of x. But given that y ⊂ z and y touches the boundary of x, z should also touch the boundary of x wherever y does. Using the same reasoning as for NTPP, I don't think NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This means x = z. There's nothing in our given information that contradicts this, so EQ(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I think I'm still confused about NTPP and NTPPi. Let me think even more carefully.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But we also know that y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y touches z's boundary, and y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is fully inside x. But if y is fully inside x and y touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary at the same point. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), we need z to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But we also know that y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y touches x's boundary, and y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is fully inside z. But if y is fully inside z and y touches x's boundary, then z must also touch x's boundary at the same point. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So I think the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, wait. I think I've misunderstood the definition of tangential proper part again.

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. This means:
- a is a proper part of b (a ⊂ b and a ≠ b)
- a touches the boundary of b, meaning a has at least one point in common with the boundary of b.

The fact that a touches the boundary of b doesn't mean that every part of a touches the boundary of b, or that a forms the boundary of b.

So let's reconsider the relations:

For TPPi(x,y), we have TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x (y ⊂ x and y ≠ x)
- y touches the boundary of x, meaning y has at least one point in common with the boundary of x.

For TPP(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is a proper part of z (y ⊂ z and y ≠ z)
- y touches the boundary of z, meaning y has at least one point in common with the boundary of z.

Now let's reconsider NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be a non-tangential proper part of z. This means:
- x is a proper part of z (x ⊂ z and x ≠ z)
- x does not touch the boundary of z, meaning x has no points in common with the boundary of z.

But if y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of z, then x also has a point in common with the boundary of z (the same point where y touches it). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), we need z to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means:
- z is a proper part of x (z ⊂ x and z ≠ x)
- z does not touch the boundary of x, meaning z has no points in common with the boundary of x.

But if y ⊂ z and y touches the boundary of x, then z also has a point in common with the boundary of x (the same point where y touches it). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So I think the possible relations between x and z are indeed: PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I need to double-check again, using the most systematic approach I can think of. I'll consider the full composition table for RCC-8 relations, and look up the composition of TPPi with TPP. This table would already have considered all the possibilities and constraints.

The composition of R1(x,y) and R2(y,z) refers to all possible relations R3(x,z) given that R1(x,y) and R2(y,z) hold.

In this case, we're looking for the composition of TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), which is the same as the composition of TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z).

Let me think it through step-by-step.

TPP(y,x) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x (y ⊂ x and y ≠ x)
- y touches the boundary of x, meaning y has at least one point in common with the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is a proper part of z (y ⊂ z and y ≠ z)
- y touches the boundary of z, meaning y has at least one point in common with the boundary of z.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Given y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, x and z share at least the region y, so they can't be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interiors.
   Given y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, x and z share at least the interior of y, not just their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This means x and z share some points, but each has points not in the other. We know they share at least the region y. For PO to hold, x must have points not in z, and z must have points not in x. There's nothing in our given information that contradicts this, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and x touches the boundary of z. Is this possible? If y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of z, then x also touches the boundary of z at the same point. So the condition that x touches the boundary of z is satisfied. And there's nothing preventing x from being fully contained in z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. Is this possible? If y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of z, then x also touches the boundary of z at the same point. So x cannot be a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and z touches the boundary of x. Is this possible? If y ⊂ z and y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x at the same point. So the condition that z touches the boundary of x is satisfied. And there's nothing preventing z from being fully contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This means z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and z does not touch the boundary of x. Is this possible? If y ⊂ z and y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x at the same point. So z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This means x = z. Is this possible? If y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, there's nothing contradicting x = z. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So I think the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

It doesn't seem like NTPP or NTPPi can be the relationship between x and z, given the constraints.

Actually, I realize where my previous error was. I was only vaguely thinking about the fact that y is a "tangential" proper part, without fully considering what that means. The key insight is that if y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, then y touches the boundaries of both x and z. And if y is inside both x and z, then wherever y touches the boundary of z, x must also touch the boundary of z at that point, making NTPP(x,z) impossible. Similarly, wherever y touches the boundary of x, z must also touch the boundary of x at that point, making NTPPi(x,z) impossible.

So I'm confident that the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually wait, I may have been rushing to a conclusion. Let's double check. The condition for NTPP(x,z) to be impossible is: if y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of z, then x also touches the boundary of z at the same point. Is this always true?

Let's say y touches the boundary of z at point p. And y ⊂ x. Does this mean x contains point p? If p is a point of y, and y ⊂ x, then p is also a point of x. So yes, x would touch the boundary of z at point p, making NTPP(x,z) impossible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to be impossible, we need to check: if y ⊂ z and y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x at the same point. Let's say y touches the boundary of x at point q. And y ⊂ z. Does this mean z contains point q? If q is a point of y, and y ⊂ z, then q is also a point of z. So yes, z would touch the boundary of x at point q, making NTPPi(x,z) impossible.

So I'm still confident that the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I should check the RCC-8 composition table to verify my reasoning. Let me just recall the most relevant compositions:

For RCC-8, the composition TPPi ∘ TPP should give the possible relations between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

According to the RCC-8 composition table, TPPi ∘ TPP = {PO, TPP, TPPi, EQ}.

This matches my conclusion, so I'm confident that the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Let me just double-check by considering concrete examples for each of these relations.

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Imagine y is a square, x is a rectangle that properly contains y and extends to the left of y, and z is a rectangle that properly contains y and extends to the right of y. y touches the left edge of x and the right edge of z. x and z overlap at y, but each has parts not in the other. This satisfies TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and PO(x,z).

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Imagine y is a square, x is a rectangle that properly contains y, and z is a larger rectangle that properly contains x. y touches the left edge of x and the left edge of z at the same point. This satisfies TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

3. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Imagine y is a square, z is a rectangle that properly contains y, and x is a larger rectangle that properly contains z. y touches the right edge of z and the right edge of x at the same point. This satisfies TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

4. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   Imagine y is a square, and x and z are the same rectangle that properly contains y. y touches the left edge of x/z. This satisfies TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and EQ(x,z).

So I've found concrete examples for all four of the proposed relations. I'm confident that the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible, because, as I've shown, if y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, then x must touch the boundary of z wherever y does, and z must touch the boundary of x wherever y does.

DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible, because y is in the intersection of x and z, so x and z must share interior points.

So the answer is: The possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what's possible when we have TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), so:
- y is a proper part of x (y ⊂ x)
- y touches x's boundary

TPP(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z (y ⊂ z)
- y touches z's boundary

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the region of y.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because x and z share interior points (specifically, points in y).

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z overlap at y (and possibly more), but each can have parts the other doesn't contain.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be properly contained in z while touching z's boundary (where y touches it).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If y touches z's boundary and y is contained in x, then x must also touch z's boundary at that same point.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be properly contained in x while touching x's boundary (where y touches it).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If y touches x's boundary and y is contained in z, then z must also touch x's boundary at that same point.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. x and z can be identical regions, both containing y as a tangential proper part.
