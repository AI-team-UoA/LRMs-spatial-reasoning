PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to figure out what are the possible relationships between x and z given that TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me break down what these relations mean:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. So x is completely contained within y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. So y is completely contained within z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z.

First, since x is contained within y (from TPP(x,y)), and y is contained within z (from TPP(y,z)), it follows that x is contained within z. This means that x is either a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)) or a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).

For x to be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), x must touch the boundary of z. Since x touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)), and y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)), it's possible that x touches the boundary of z exactly at the point(s) where y touches the boundary of z. In this case, we would have TPP(x,z).

On the other hand, it's also possible that x only touches the boundary of y at points where y does not touch the boundary of z. In this case, x would be completely contained within z without touching the boundary of z, which would give us NTPP(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. TPP(x,z)
2. NTPP(x,z)

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what happens when x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is a tangential proper part of z.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary

Since x is contained in y, and y is contained in z, we know that x must be contained in z. This means x is either a proper part of z that touches z's boundary (TPP) or a proper part that doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP).

Two cases are possible:
1. If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x will also touch z's boundary, giving us TPP(x,z)
2. If x only touches y's boundary at points where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x will be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, giving us NTPP(x,z)

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
