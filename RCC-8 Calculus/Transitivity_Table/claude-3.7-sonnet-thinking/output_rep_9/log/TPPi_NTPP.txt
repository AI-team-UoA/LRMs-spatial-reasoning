PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me go through this step by step.

We have:
1. TPPi(x,y) - this means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x.
2. NTPP(y,z) - this means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Now we need to determine what relation holds between x and z.

Let's think about what these relations mean spatially:
- TPP(y,x) means y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Given this, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is inside both x and z, there must be some overlap between x and z. So DC and EC are definitely not possible.

Now let's go through the possible relations one by one:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible because x and z must share at least the region y.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible for the same reason as above.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible if x and z partially overlap. This could happen if part of x is outside z and part of z is outside x, while they share y.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Possible if x and z coincide exactly.

Wait, I need to be more careful about this analysis. Let me think more systematically.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary)

Now, for x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is part of both x and z, x and z must share at least y. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. But since y is in the interior of both x and z, x and z do share interior points. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - This means x and z partially overlap, with neither being fully contained in the other. This is possible. For example, x could extend beyond z in some directions, and z could extend beyond x in others, while they both contain y.

4. TPP(x,z) - This means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). This is possible if x is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary). This is possible if x is fully contained within the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - This means z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). Given that y is a tangential proper part of x and y is a non-tangential proper part of z, it seems unlikely that z could be a proper part of x. If z were inside x, and y is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then y would be farther from x's boundary than z is, which contradicts y touching x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)). So TPPi(x,z) seems not possible.

Hmm, actually let me reconsider this. If y touches x's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y to enclose it. This means z cannot be completely inside x, because if it were, it would contradict the fact that y touches x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). Following the same logic as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - This means x and z coincide exactly. If y is a tangential proper part of x but a non-tangential proper part of z, then x and z cannot be equal. So EQ is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO, TPP, NTPP.

Wait, I think I need to double-check my reasoning for TPPi and NTPPi:

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary. Given that y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)) and y is a non-tangential proper part of z (from NTPP(y,z)), we need to check if z can still be a proper part of x.

If z is a proper part of x, and y is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of x (by transitivity of the "proper part" relation). This is consistent with TPPi(x,y).

But there's a contradiction when we consider the tangentiality. If y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)) and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), then z must extend beyond y at least in the direction of x's boundary. This implies that z also touches x's boundary. But if z touches x's boundary and is a proper part of x, then z would be a tangential proper part of x, giving TPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct here. Let me rethink.

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
If NTPP(y,z), then y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, if y touches x's boundary and y is completely inside z, then z must extend beyond y in the direction of x's boundary. But this doesn't necessarily mean z extends beyond x. It's possible that z is also inside x, with its boundary coinciding with x's boundary at the points where y touches x's boundary.

But if z's boundary coincides with x's boundary at those points, then z would touch x's boundary, making TPPi(x,z) possible.

But wait, if z extends exactly to x's boundary at the points where y touches, and y is non-tangential to z, then there would be a gap between y and z's boundary, which contradicts the statement that y touches x's boundary.

Let me think about this visually. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y towards x's boundary, but not all the way to x's boundary. This means z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, which would be NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think my analysis got confused. Let me reconsider more carefully.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary)

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

If y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)) and y is inside z without touching z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), then z must extend beyond y towards x's boundary. But for z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must not extend beyond x's boundary.

Let's consider a concrete example. Imagine x is a circle, and y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at one point. For NTPP(y,z) to be true, z must be a circle that completely contains y and has some gap between its boundary and y's boundary. But this means z must extend beyond the point where y touches x's boundary, which would make z extend beyond x, contradicting TPPi(x,z).

So I think TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Again, if y touches x's boundary and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y towards x's boundary. But for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must not touch x's boundary.

Given the constraints, it seems like z would have to extend to just short of x's boundary, making NTPPi(x,z) possible.

Oh, I think I've been making an error in my reasoning. Let me revise my understanding.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means that y is fully inside x and touches x's boundary at least at one point.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that y is fully inside z and does not touch z's boundary.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

PO(x,z) is possible: x and z could partially overlap, with neither fully containing the other.

TPP(x,z) is possible: x could be fully inside z and touch z's boundary.

NTPP(x,z) is possible: x could be fully inside z and not touch z's boundary.

TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z would have to be fully inside x and touch x's boundary. If y is fully inside x and touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), and y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), then z must extend beyond y in the direction of x's boundary. But if z extends beyond y to touch x's boundary, this doesn't contradict the given relations. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z would have to be fully inside x and not touch x's boundary. Given the constraints, this is also possible.

EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z would have to be exactly the same region. But if y is a tangential proper part of x and a non-tangential proper part of z, then x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me visualize a few concrete examples to make sure:

Scenario 1 (TPP(x,z)):
- x is a circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at one point
- z is a larger circle that contains both x and y, and x touches z's boundary at one point

In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) is true (y is inside x and touches x's boundary), and NTPP(y,z) is true (y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary). And TPP(x,z) is true (x is inside z and touches z's boundary).

Scenario 2 (NTPP(x,z)):
- x is a circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at one point
- z is a much larger circle that contains both x and y, with some gap between x's boundary and z's boundary

In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) is true, NTPP(y,z) is true, and NTPP(x,z) is also true (x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary).

Scenario 3 (PO(x,z)):
- x is a circle
- y is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's boundary at one point
- z is a circle that contains y but also extends beyond x in some direction, while not fully containing x

In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) is true, NTPP(y,z) is true, and PO(x,z) is true (x and z partially overlap).

Scenario 4 (TPPi(x,z)):
Hmm, I'm having trouble visualizing a scenario where TPPi(x,z) would be true given the constraints. If y touches x's boundary and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y towards x's boundary. But for TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be fully inside x and touch x's boundary.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe z could be another shape that wraps around y but is still contained within x.

Actually I think I was mistaken when considering TPPi(x,z). Let me reconsider:

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary.

Given that y is a tangential proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)) and y is a non-tangential proper part of z (from NTPP(y,z)), we need to check if z can still be a tangential proper part of x.

If y touches x's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y in the direction of x's boundary. This means z also touches x's boundary at those points.

But is z fully inside x? If y is inside x and z contains y, z could still be fully inside x, especially if x is much larger than both y and z.

So I think TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Scenario 4 (TPPi(x,z)):
- x is a large circle
- y is a small circle inside x that touches x's boundary at one point
- z is a medium circle that fully contains y (with a gap between their boundaries) and touches x's boundary at the same point that y does

In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) is true, NTPP(y,z) is true, and TPPi(x,z) is also true (z is inside x and touches x's boundary).

Scenario 5 (NTPPi(x,z)):
Actually, I think I'm getting confused again. I'm having trouble visualizing a scenario where NTPPi(x,z) would be true given the constraints.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

But if y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)) and y is inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), then z must also extend to x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,z).

So I think NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

To recap, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and TPPi(x,z).

Actually, I still think I've been making a mistake. Let me reconsider the problem from scratch with a clearer mind.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means TPP(y,x), so y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is fully inside x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let's go through them systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is part of both x and z, x and z must share at least y. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. But since y is in the interior of both x and z, x and z do share interior points. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - This means x and z partially overlap, with neither being fully contained in the other. This is possible if part of x is outside z and part of z is outside x, while they both contain y.

4. TPP(x,z) - This means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary). This is possible if x is contained within z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary). This is possible if x is fully contained within the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - This means z is a tangential proper part of x (z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary). 

Let's think about this carefully: y is a tangential proper part of x (y touches x's boundary), and y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y doesn't touch z's boundary). If z were a tangential proper part of x, then z would touch x's boundary.

But if y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)) and y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), then y must be some distance away from z's boundary. And if z touches x's boundary, then there's a region of z between y and x's boundary. But this means y doesn't touch x's boundary, which contradicts TPPi(x,y).

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). 

Using the same logic as above, if y touches x's boundary and y doesn't touch z's boundary, then z cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x, because z would have to extend between y and x's boundary, which would make z touch x's boundary (contradicting the non-tangentiality).

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - This means x and z coincide exactly. If y is a tangential proper part of x but a non-tangential proper part of z, then x and z cannot be equal. So EQ is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Wait, on second thought, I think I might be making an error. Let's be more careful about what TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) imply.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Now, if y touches x's boundary and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then there's a gap between y and z's boundary. But if z touches x's boundary and y is inside z, then y could still touch x's boundary at the same point where z touches x's boundary.

Wait, I need to visualize this more concretely. Let's say x is a large circle, y is a small circle inside x that touches x's boundary at a point p, and z is a medium circle that fully contains y with a gap between their boundaries. For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be inside x and touch x's boundary. But if y touches x's boundary at point p, and y is inside z with a gap, then z would have to extend beyond y to include point p, which means z also touches x's boundary at point p.

But this is consistent! y can touch x's boundary at point p, be fully inside z with a gap to z's boundary everywhere except at point p, and z can touch x's boundary at point p as well.

So TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me visualize this:
- x: a large circle
- y: a small circle inside x that touches x's boundary at point p
- z: a medium circle that fully contains y, with y not touching z's boundary except possibly at point p, and z touching x's boundary at point p

In this scenario, TPPi(x,y) is true, NTPP(y,z) is true, and TPPi(x,z) is also true.

But wait, if y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)), then y can't touch z's boundary at point p. And if y touches x's boundary at point p, and z also touches x's boundary at point p, then y would also touch z's boundary at point p, which contradicts NTPP(y,z).

So I think TPPi(x,z) is not possible after all.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would have to be a non-tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But if y touches x's boundary and y is inside z, then z must also extend to touch x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,z).

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me try once more with a clear head. I'm drawing on paper to help me visualize.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is fully contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is fully contained within z, and y does not touch the boundary of z. This means there's a "buffer" or gap between y and the boundary of z.

Now, for the relation between x and z, let's go through the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is contained in both x and z, x and z must share at least the region occupied by y. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But since y is in the interior of both x and z, x and z do share interior points. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - This means x and z partially overlap, with neither being fully contained in the other. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - This means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary). This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary). This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - This means z is a tangential proper part of x (z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary). 

Let's use my drawing to check: If y touches the boundary of x and y is fully inside z with a gap to z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y to include that gap. But this means z would extend beyond the point where y touches x's boundary, which would make z extend outside of x. This contradicts the definition of TPPi(x,z), which requires z to be fully inside x.

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). 

Using the same logic, if y touches the boundary of x and y is fully inside z with a gap to z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y, which would make z extend outside of x. This contradicts the definition of NTPPi(x,z).

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - This means x and z coincide exactly. But if y is a tangential proper part of x and a non-tangential proper part of z, then x and z cannot be equal. So EQ is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more concrete and rigorous. I'm still not satisfied with my reasoning.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary)

I need to understand what these relations constrain about the regions x, y, and z. Then I can determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is fully contained within x
- y touches the boundary of x
- y is not equal to x

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is fully contained within z
- y does not touch the boundary of z
- y is not equal to z

Now, let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is contained in both x and z, x and z must share at least the region occupied by y. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But since y is in the interior of both x and z, x and z do share interior points. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - This means x and z partially overlap, with neither being fully contained in the other. This is possible. For example, x could extend beyond z in some areas, and z could extend beyond x in others, while they both contain y.

4. TPP(x,z) - This means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary). 

Is this possible? If y touches the boundary of x and y is inside z with a gap to z's boundary, then x's boundary must be inside z. But can x's boundary touch z's boundary? I believe it can. If we place x inside z such that x's boundary touches z's boundary at some point, and y is inside x touching x's boundary at a different point, then all constraints are satisfied.

So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary). 

Is this possible? Similar to the above, we can place x inside z such that there's a gap between x's boundary and z's boundary, and y is inside x touching x's boundary. This satisfies all constraints.

So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - This means z is a tangential proper part of x (z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary). 

Is this possible? If y touches the boundary of x and y is inside z with a gap to z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y to include that gap. But the boundary of z cannot extend beyond the boundary of x, or else z would not be fully inside x. So the only way for these constraints to be consistent is if z extends exactly to the boundary of x at the points where y touches x's boundary, and there's a gap between y and z's boundary everywhere else.

But this means y would touch the boundary of z at those points, which contradicts NTPP(y,z). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). 

Is this possible? If y touches the boundary of x and y is inside z, then z must extend to include the points where y touches x's boundary. But if z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z must not touch x's boundary. These two requirements are contradictory.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - This means x and z coincide exactly. 

Is this possible? If y is a tangential proper part of x, it touches x's boundary. If y is a non-tangential proper part of z, it doesn't touch z's boundary. If x and z are equal, then x's boundary is the same as z's boundary. But then y cannot both touch and not touch this boundary. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

It took me a few iterations, but I'm pretty confident in this answer now. The key insight is that if y touches the boundary of x and y is inside z with a gap to z's boundary, then z must extend to include the points where y touches x's boundary. This rules out TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z). But it still allows for PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check my answer:
- DC(x,z): Not possible because y is in both x and z.
- EC(x,z): Not possible because y is in the interior of both x and z.
- PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible because if y touches x's boundary and y is inside z with a gap to z's boundary, then z would have to extend beyond x.
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because y cannot both touch and not touch the same boundary.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) again, because I think I might be mistaken.

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is fully contained within x, and z touches the boundary of x.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

If y touches the boundary of x and y is inside z with a gap to z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y to include that gap. This means z extends towards the boundary of x. But for TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be fully inside x and touch x's boundary.

So, for these to be consistent, z must extend exactly to the boundary of x at the points where y touches x's boundary, and not beyond. But if z's boundary coincides with x's boundary at those points, and y touches x's boundary at those points, then y would also touch z's boundary at those points, which contradicts NTPP(y,z).

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I think my reasoning is correct now, and the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I was making a mistake in my earlier reasoning for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me think through this more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is fully contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x at some point p.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is fully contained within z, and y does not touch the boundary of z anywhere.

Now, for TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a tangential proper part of x. So z must be fully contained within x, and z must touch the boundary of x at some point q.

But if y touches the boundary of x at point p, and y is fully contained within z without touching z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y to include a buffer around y. This means z must extend beyond point p, which would place z outside of x. This contradicts the requirement that z is fully contained within x.

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x. So z must be fully contained within x, and z must not touch the boundary of x anywhere.

Again, if y touches the boundary of x at point p, and y is fully contained within z, then z must extend beyond y to include point p. But this would mean z touches the boundary of x at point p, which contradicts the requirement that z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be exactly the same region. But if y touches the boundary of x and y does not touch the boundary of z, then x and z cannot be the same region.

So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

That leaves PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) as the possible relations between x and z.

Actually I'm still not satisfied. Let me go through this even more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is fully contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x at some point p.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is fully contained within z, and y does not touch the boundary of z anywhere.

For y to touch the boundary of x at point p, and for y to be fully contained within z without touching z's boundary, z must extend beyond y to include a buffer around y. This means z must extend beyond point p.

Now let's go through each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - This means x and z are disconnected. But since y is contained in both x and z, x and z cannot be disconnected. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But since y is in the interior of both x and z, x and z must share interior points. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - This means x and z partially overlap, with neither being fully contained in the other. This is possible. For example, z could extend beyond x in some areas, and x could extend beyond z in others, while they both contain y.

4. TPP(x,z) - This means x is a tangential proper part of z (x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary). This is possible. For example, x could be fully contained within z, with their boundaries touching at some point, and y could be inside x touching x's boundary at a different point.

5. NTPP(x,z) - This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary). This is possible. For example, x could be fully contained within z with a gap between their boundaries, and y could be inside x touching x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - This means z is a tangential proper part of x (z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary). 

If y touches the boundary of x at point p, and y is fully contained within z without touching z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y and must include point p. But if z includes point p, which is on the boundary of x, then z cannot be fully contained within x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I'm not being precise enough. Point p is not "on" the boundary of x, but rather y touches the boundary of x at point p. This means that point p is on both y and the boundary of x.

If y is fully contained within z without touching z's boundary, then z must completely enclose y with a gap between them. This means z must extend beyond y in all directions, including at point p. But if z extends beyond y at point p, then z would extend beyond the boundary of x, which means z cannot be fully contained within x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). 

Using the same logic as above, if y touches the boundary of x at point p, and y is fully contained within z, then z must extend beyond y and include point p. But point p is on the boundary of x, so z would touch the boundary of x at point p. This contradicts the definition of NTPPi(x,z), which requires z to be fully inside x and not touch x's boundary.

So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - This means x and z coincide exactly. 

If y touches the boundary of x at point p, and y is fully contained within z without touching z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y at point p. But if x and z are the same region, then their boundaries are the same. This means y would touch the boundary of z at point p, which contradicts the definition of NTPP(y,z).

So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

I keep changing my mind on this, but after careful reconsideration, I think this final analysis is correct. The confusion stems from the subtle distinction between "touching the boundary" and "being on the boundary". 

To clarify once more:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is fully contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x at some point p. This means p is a point on both y and the boundary of x.
- NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is fully contained within z, and y does not touch the boundary of z anywhere.

Since y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, z must extend beyond y in all directions, including at point p. But if z extends beyond y at point p, it would extend beyond the boundary of x, which means z cannot be fully inside x. This rules out TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

And if x and z are the same region, then y would touch the boundary of z at point p (since it touches the boundary of x at point p), which contradicts NTPP(y,z). This rules out EQ(x,z).

So, the final answer is: the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's be super clear: TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x, so y is fully contained within x and y ≠ x.
- y is tangential to x, so y touches the boundary of x.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is a proper part of z, so y is fully contained within z and y ≠ z.
- y is non-tangential to z, so y does not touch the boundary of z.

For y to be tangential to x, there must be a point p that is both on y and on the boundary of x. For y to be non-tangential to z, there must be no point on y that is also on the boundary of z. For all points on y, there must be some buffer of z extending beyond y.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

If y touches the boundary of x at point p, and y is inside z with a buffer in all directions, then z must extend beyond y at point p. This means z extends beyond the boundary of x at point p, which places a part of z outside of x. This rules out TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z), because all of these require z to be contained within x or equal to x.

So, the possible relations are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Yep, I was overthinking this, but I think this is the correct final answer. The possible relations between x and z are:

- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, with neither being fully contained in the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, so x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me understand what these constraints mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is fully contained within x and touches x's boundary at some point.
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is fully contained within z and does not touch z's boundary anywhere.

Now I'll analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible because y is contained in both x and z, so they must share at least the region occupied by y.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible because y is in the interior of both x and z, so they must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with neither being fully contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be fully inside z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be fully inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible. If y touches x's boundary and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then z must extend beyond y at the point where y touches x's boundary. This would place part of z outside x, contradicting the requirement that z is fully inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible. Using the same reasoning as for TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would both touch and not touch the same boundary, which is contradictory.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
