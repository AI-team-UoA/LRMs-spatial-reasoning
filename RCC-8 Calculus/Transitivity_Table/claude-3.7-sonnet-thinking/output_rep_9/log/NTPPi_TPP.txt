PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm being asked to determine what possible relations can hold between $x$ and $z$, given that $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$ and $\text{TPP}(y, z)$.

First, let me make sure I understand these relations correctly:

- $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$ means that $y$ is a non-tangential proper part of $x$. In other words, $y$ is completely contained within the interior of $x$, not touching $x$'s boundary.

- $\text{TPP}(y, z)$ means that $y$ is a tangential proper part of $z$. In other words, $y$ is completely contained within $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary.

Now, given these two conditions, I need to determine what relation can hold between $x$ and $z$. Let's think about this:

$\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$ means that $y$ is completely contained within the interior of $x$.
$\text{TPP}(y, z)$ means that $y$ is completely contained within $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary.

So $y$ is contained within both $x$ and $z$. But $y$ touches the boundary of $z$ while being entirely in the interior of $x$ (not touching $x$'s boundary).

Let's consider the possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between $x$ and $z$:

1. $\text{DC}(x, z)$: This means $x$ and $z$ are disconnected. But we know that $y$ is contained in both $x$ and $z$, so they must share at least the space occupied by $y$. So $\text{DC}(x, z)$ is not possible.

2. $\text{EC}(x, z)$: This means $x$ and $z$ touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Again, since $y$ is contained in both $x$ and $z$, they must share interior parts. So $\text{EC}(x, z)$ is not possible.

3. $\text{PO}(x, z)$: This means $x$ and $z$ share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is a possibility, as $x$ could extend beyond $z$ in some areas, and $z$ could extend beyond $x$ in others.

4. $\text{TPP}(x, z)$: This means $x$ is a tangential proper part of $z$. This is possible if $x$ is completely contained within $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary.

5. $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$: This means $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $z$. This is possible if $x$ is completely contained within the interior of $z$ (not touching $z$'s boundary).

6. $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$: This means $z$ is a tangential proper part of $x$. This is possible if $z$ is completely contained within $x$ and touches $x$'s boundary.

7. $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$: This means $z$ is a non-tangential proper part of $x$. This is possible if $z$ is completely contained within the interior of $x$ (not touching $x$'s boundary).

8. $\text{EQ}(x, z)$: This means $x$ and $z$ are coincident. This is possible if $x$ and $z$ occupy exactly the same space.

Now, let me carefully analyze which of these are consistent with the given constraints:

Given $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$, we know that $y$ is entirely contained within the interior of $x$, not touching $x$'s boundary.

Given $\text{TPP}(y, z)$, we know that $y$ is entirely contained within $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary.

Let's analyze each possibility:

3. $\text{PO}(x, z)$: We know that $y$ is contained in both $x$ and $z$, so they share at least the space occupied by $y$. Also, since $y$ touches the boundary of $z$ but is entirely in the interior of $x$, it seems that $x$ must extend beyond $z$ in at least some region. And since $y$ does not fully fill $z$ (as it's a proper part), $z$ might extend beyond $x$ in some regions. So $\text{PO}(x, z)$ is a possibility.

4. $\text{TPP}(x, z)$: For this to be true, $x$ must be entirely contained within $z$ and touch $z$'s boundary. Given that $y$ is entirely within the interior of $x$ and also touches $z$'s boundary, it seems that $x$ must also touch $z$'s boundary at the same points where $y$ does. This means $x$ must touch $z$'s boundary, making $\text{TPP}(x, z)$ possible.

5. $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$: For this to be true, $x$ must be entirely contained within the interior of $z$, not touching $z$'s boundary. But we know that $y$ is entirely within the interior of $x$ and touches $z$'s boundary. This means that $x$ must also touch $z$'s boundary at those same points, which contradicts $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$. So $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$ is not possible.

6. $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$: For this to be true, $z$ must be entirely contained within $x$ and touch $x$'s boundary. But we know that $y$ is entirely within the interior of $x$ and touches $z$'s boundary. Since $y$ touches $z$'s boundary, and $y$ is entirely within the interior of $x$ (not touching $x$'s boundary), it means that at least some part of $z$'s boundary is not touching $x$'s boundary. But for $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$ to be true, $z$ must touch $x$'s boundary. This is a contradiction, so $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$ is not possible.

7. $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$: For this to be true, $z$ must be entirely contained within the interior of $x$, not touching $x$'s boundary. But we know that $y$ touches $z$'s boundary, so $y$ and $z$ share a boundary point. And since $y$ is entirely within the interior of $x$, this boundary point of $z$ is also within the interior of $x$. This means that $z$ is entirely contained within the interior of $x$, making $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$ possible.

8. $\text{EQ}(x, z)$: For this to be true, $x$ and $z$ must occupy exactly the same space. But we know that $y$ touches $z$'s boundary while being entirely in the interior of $x$. This implies that $z$'s boundary is within the interior of $x$, which means $x$ extends beyond $z$. So $\text{EQ}(x, z)$ is not possible.

Let me double check and make sure I haven't made a mistake in my reasoning:

3. $\text{PO}(x, z)$: We know that $y$ is a proper part of both $x$ and $z$, so $x$ and $z$ definitely share a part. Since $y$ touches $z$'s boundary but doesn't touch $x$'s boundary, $x$ must extend beyond $z$ in at least some region. And since $y$ is a proper part of $z$ (not all of $z$), $z$ might extend beyond $x$ in some regions. So $\text{PO}(x, z)$ is a possibility.

4. $\text{TPP}(x, z)$: For this to be true, $x$ must be entirely contained within $z$ and touch $z$'s boundary. Given that $y$ is entirely within the interior of $x$ and also touches $z$'s boundary, it seems that $x$ must also touch $z$'s boundary at the same points where $y$ does.

Wait, that's a contradiction. If $y$ touches $z$'s boundary while being entirely in the interior of $x$, then those boundary points of $z$ are in the interior of $x$, not on the boundary of $x$. So $x$ doesn't necessarily touch $z$'s boundary at those points.

Let me reconsider. If $y$ touches $z$'s boundary, that means there's a point $p$ on the boundary of $z$ that's also in $y$. And since $y$ is entirely within the interior of $x$, $p$ is in the interior of $x$. So at the point $p$, $z$'s boundary is within the interior of $x$. This means $x$ extends beyond $z$ at that boundary point, which rules out $\text{TPP}(x, z)$.

So $\text{TPP}(x, z)$ is not possible.

Let me take a step back and rethink. I think I'm making this too complicated. 

Given:
- $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$: $y$ is entirely within the interior of $x$, not touching $x$'s boundary.
- $\text{TPP}(y, z)$: $y$ is entirely within $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary.

What can we infer about the relationship between $x$ and $z$?

Actually let me draw a diagram to visualize this. Let's denote the boundary of a region with a solid line and the interior with a dotted line:

```
      +------------+   z
      |            |
      |   +-----+  |
      |   |  y  |  |
      |   +-----+  |
      |            |
      +------------+
   +------------------+   x
   |                  |
   |                  |
   +------------------+
```

In this diagram, $y$ is inside $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary (TPP(y,z)). And $y$ is inside $x$ but doesn't touch $x$'s boundary (NTPPi(x,y)). As we can see, in this case, $x$ and $z$ have a partial overlap. Neither is contained within the other. So $\text{PO}(x, z)$ is one possibility.

But let's try another diagram:

```
   +------------------+   x
   |                  |
   |    +---------+   |   z
   |    |         |   |
   |    |  +---+  |   |
   |    |  | y |  |   |
   |    |  +---+  |   |
   |    +---------+   |
   |                  |
   +------------------+
```

In this diagram, $y$ is inside $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary (TPP(y,z)). And $y$ is inside $x$ but doesn't touch $x$'s boundary (NTPPi(x,y)). But here, $z$ is entirely contained within the interior of $x$, not touching $x$'s boundary. So $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$ is another possibility.

Let's try one more:

```
   +------------------+   x
   |                  |
   |    +---------+   |   z
   |    |         |   |
   |    |  +---+  |   |
   |    |  | y |  |   |
   |    |  +---+  |   |
   |    |         |   |
   +------------------+
   |    |         |   |
   |    +---------+   |
   |                  |
   +------------------+
```

In this diagram, $y$ is inside $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary (TPP(y,z)). And $y$ is inside $x$ but doesn't touch $x$'s boundary (NTPPi(x,y)). But here, $z$ touches $x$'s boundary. So $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$ is another possibility.

OK that feels like it exhausts all the possibilities. 

So, the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$ and $\text{TPP}(y, z)$ are:
- $\text{PO}(x, z)$
- $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$
- $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$

But let me double check that these all make sense.

$\text{PO}(x, z)$: This means $x$ and $z$ share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. As shown in the first diagram, this is a valid possibility.

$\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$: This means $z$ is entirely contained within the interior of $x$, not touching $x$'s boundary. As shown in the second diagram, this is a valid possibility.

$\text{TPPi}(x, z)$: This means $z$ is entirely contained within $x$ and touches $x$'s boundary. As shown in the third diagram, this is a valid possibility.

In all these cases, $y$ is entirely within the interior of $x$ and doesn't touch $x$'s boundary (satisfying $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$), and $y$ is entirely within $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary (satisfying $\text{TPP}(y, z)$).

So, the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given the constraints are:
- $\text{PO}(x, z)$
- $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$
- $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$

Actually let me check once more to make sure I haven't missed any possibilities. Let's use a systematic approach: $y$ is completely contained within both $x$ and $z$, and $y$ touches the boundary of $z$ but not the boundary of $x$. The remaining regions (outside of $y$) of $x$ and $z$ can overlap in various ways:

1. $x$ extends beyond $z$ in some regions, and $z$ extends beyond $x$ in others. This gives $\text{PO}(x, z)$.
2. $x$ completely contains $z$, and $z$ doesn't touch the boundary of $x$. This gives $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$.
3. $x$ completely contains $z$, and $z$ touches the boundary of $x$. This gives $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$.
4. $z$ completely contains $x$, and $x$ doesn't touch the boundary of $z$. This gives $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$.
5. $z$ completely contains $x$, and $x$ touches the boundary of $z$. This gives $\text{TPP}(x, z)$.
6. $x$ and $z$ occupy the same space. This gives $\text{EQ}(x, z)$.

But let's check which of these are consistent with the given constraints:

4. $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$: If $x$ is completely contained within the interior of $z$, and $y$ is completely contained within the interior of $x$, then $y$ would be completely contained within the interior of $z$, not touching $z$'s boundary. This contradicts $\text{TPP}(y, z)$. So $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$ is not possible.

5. $\text{TPP}(x, z)$: If $x$ is completely contained within $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary, and $y$ is completely contained within the interior of $x$, then the part of $y$ touching $z$'s boundary would also be in the interior of $x$. This means that part of $x$ extends beyond the boundary of $z$, which contradicts $\text{TPP}(x, z)$. So $\text{TPP}(x, z)$ is not possible.

6. $\text{EQ}(x, z)$: If $x$ and $z$ occupy the same space, and $y$ touches the boundary of $z$, then $y$ would also touch the boundary of $x$. This contradicts $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$. So $\text{EQ}(x, z)$ is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given the constraints are:
- $\text{PO}(x, z)$
- $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$
- $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$

Actually wait, now I'm having second thoughts about TPPi(x, z). Let's analyze it more carefully.

$\text{TPPi}(x, z)$ means that $z$ is completely contained within $x$ and touches $x$'s boundary. But we know that $y$ touches $z$'s boundary while being completely in the interior of $x$. Let's think about this more carefully.

If $y$ touches $z$'s boundary at a point $p$, then $p$ is on the boundary of $z$. And since $y$ is completely in the interior of $x$, $p$ is also in the interior of $x$. So, at the point $p$, the boundary of $z$ is in the interior of $x$. This seems to suggest that $z$ is completely contained within the interior of $x$, which corresponds to $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$, not $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$.

But wait. This might not be the case everywhere. It's possible that at some other point, the boundary of $z$ touches the boundary of $x$. In that case, we would have $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$.

Let me draw another diagram:

```
   +------------------+   x
   |                  |
   |    +---------+   |   z
   |    |         |   |
   |    |  +---+  |   |
   |    |  | y |  |   |
   |    |  +---+  |   |
   |    |         |   |
   |    +---------+   |
   |                  |
   +------------------+
```

In this diagram, $y$ is inside $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary (TPP(y,z)). And $y$ is inside $x$ but doesn't touch $x$'s boundary (NTPPi(x,y)). And $z$ is completely contained within $x$ but doesn't touch $x$'s boundary. So $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$ is valid.

But let's modify the diagram slightly:

```
   +------------------+   x
   |                  |
   |    +---------+   |   z
   |    |         |   |
   |    |  +---+  |   |
   |    |  | y |  |   |
   |    |  +---+  |   |
   |    |         |   |
   |    +---------+   |
   |                  |
   +------+     +-----+
          |     |
          +-----+
```

In this diagram, $y$ is inside $z$ and touches $z$'s boundary (TPP(y,z)). And $y$ is inside $x$ but doesn't touch $x$'s boundary (NTPPi(x,y)). But $z$ touches $x$'s boundary at a point different from where $y$ touches $z$'s boundary. So $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$ is valid.

So, I think the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$ and $\text{TPP}(y, z)$ are:
- $\text{PO}(x, z)$
- $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$
- $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$

But again I'm second guessing myself. let me try a different approach, going back to the constraints and the definitions:

Given:
- $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$: $y$ is a non-tangential proper part of $x$.
- $\text{TPP}(y, z)$: $y$ is a tangential proper part of $z$.

Constraint: $y$ touches $z$'s boundary, but doesn't touch $x$'s boundary.

Let's consider the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$:

1. $\text{DC}(x, z)$: $x$ and $z$ are disconnected. Since $y$ is part of both $x$ and $z$, $x$ and $z$ must share at least the region occupied by $y$. So $\text{DC}(x, z)$ is not possible.

2. $\text{EC}(x, z)$: $x$ and $z$ touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. Again, since $y$ is part of both $x$ and $z$, $x$ and $z$ must share interior parts. So $\text{EC}(x, z)$ is not possible.

3. $\text{PO}(x, z)$: $x$ and $z$ share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is possible, as shown in the first diagram I drew.

4. $\text{TPP}(x, z)$: $x$ is a tangential proper part of $z$. For this to be true, $x$ must be completely contained within $z$ and touch $z$'s boundary. But if $y$ touches $z$'s boundary while being completely in the interior of $x$, then $x$ must extend beyond $z$ at that boundary point, which contradicts $\text{TPP}(x, z)$. So $\text{TPP}(x, z)$ is not possible.

5. $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$: $x$ is a non-tangential proper part of $z$. For this to be true, $x$ must be completely contained within the interior of $z$. But if $y$ touches $z$'s boundary while being completely in the interior of $x$, then $x$ must extend beyond $z$ at that boundary point, which contradicts $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$. So $\text{NTPP}(x, z)$ is not possible.

6. $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$: $z$ is a tangential proper part of $x$. For this to be true, $z$ must be completely contained within $x$ and touch $x$'s boundary. This is possible, as shown in the modified diagram I drew.

7. $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$: $z$ is a non-tangential proper part of $x$. For this to be true, $z$ must be completely contained within the interior of $x$. This is possible, as shown in the second diagram I drew.

8. $\text{EQ}(x, z)$: $x$ and $z$ are coincident. If $y$ touches $z$'s boundary while being completely in the interior of $x$, then $x$ and $z$ cannot be the same. So $\text{EQ}(x, z)$ is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$ and $\text{TPP}(y, z)$ are:
- $\text{PO}(x, z)$
- $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$
- $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$

The more I analyze it, the more I feel like $\text{PO}(x, z)$, $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$, and $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$ are the only possibilities. 

So, the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ given that $\text{NTPPi}(x, y)$ and $\text{TPP}(y, z)$ are:
- $\text{PO}(x, z)$
- $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$
- $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$

Actually, let me try yet another approach, using the composition table for RCC-8. The composition of two relations $R$ and $S$ is denoted as $R \circ S$, and it gives the possible relations that can hold between $x$ and $z$ if $R(x, y)$ and $S(y, z)$.

According to the RCC-8 composition table, $\text{NTPPi} \circ \text{TPP}$ should give us the possible relations between $x$ and $z$.

OK well I don't have the composition table, but I think the consistent results should still be the ones I've determined, which are:
- $\text{PO}(x, z)$
- $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$
- $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$

Let me very quickly check with one more conceptual approach. 

We know:
- $y$ is properly inside $x$ (not touching the boundary of $x$)
- $y$ is inside $z$ and touching the boundary of $z$

So we have three options:
- $z$ can be partially inside and partially outside $x$, which gives $\text{PO}(x, z)$.
- $z$ can be completely inside $x$ and not touching the boundary of $x$, which gives $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$.
- $z$ can be completely inside $x$ and touching the boundary of $x$, which gives $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$.

So the possible relationships between $x$ and $z$ are:
- $\text{PO}(x, z)$
- $\text{NTPPi}(x, z)$
- $\text{TPPi}(x, z)$

I'm confident that these are the correct possibilities.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me analyze what these given relations tell us:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely contained within the interior of x, not touching x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary

Now I'll consider each possible relation between x and z:

First, x and z must share at least some interior parts (since y is inside both), so DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible.

Since y touches z's boundary while being completely in the interior of x, z's boundary extends at least partially into x's interior. This means:

1. PO(x,z) is possible - x and z can partially overlap
2. TPPi(x,z) is possible - z can be completely inside x while touching x's boundary
3. NTPPi(x,z) is possible - z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary

TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible because if y touches z's boundary while being in x's interior, then x must extend beyond z at that boundary point.

EQ(x,z) is not possible because y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
