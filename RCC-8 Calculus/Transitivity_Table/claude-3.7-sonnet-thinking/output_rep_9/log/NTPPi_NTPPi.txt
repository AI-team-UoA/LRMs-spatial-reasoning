PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what each of these relations means.

NTPPi(x,y) means x is a container for y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. In other words, y is completely inside x with some space between y and the boundary of x.

NTPPi(y,z) means y is a container for z, and z doesn't touch the boundary of y. In other words, z is completely inside y with some space between z and the boundary of y.

So we know:
1. y is completely inside x (with space from boundary)
2. z is completely inside y (with space from boundary)

What does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

If z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x, then z must also be completely inside x. Moreover, since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, there's even more space between z and the boundary of x. So z is definitely properly inside x, not touching its boundary.

This corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I've been using "inside" in a loose sense, but I need to be more precise with these relations. Let me revisit what each relation means:

- NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b. That is, a is completely inside b and doesn't touch b's boundary.
- NTPPi(a,b) is the inverse, meaning b is completely inside a and doesn't touch a's boundary.

So given:
1. NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
2. NTPPi(y,z): z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

If z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x, then z must be completely inside x. And since z doesn't touch the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, there's definitely space between z and the boundary of x. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x). Equivalently, we can say NTPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which means z is completely inside x without touching its boundary.

Wait, let me double check this. NTPPi(a,b) means NTPP(b,a). So:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Given NTPP(y,x) and NTPP(z,y), what's the relationship between z and x?

If y is completely inside x (not touching boundary), and z is completely inside y (not touching boundary), then z is definitely completely inside x (not touching boundary). So NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I see that I'm rushing this a bit. Let me carefully check if there are any other possible relations between x and z given the conditions. I'll go through each RCC-8 relation to see if it's consistent with our constraints.

1. DC(x,z): Disconnected. This is impossible because z is inside y, which is inside x, so z must be inside x.

2. EC(x,z): Externally connected. Again, this is impossible because z is inside y, which is inside x. There's no way z can be touching the boundary of x while being completely inside y.

3. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping. This would mean z and x share a part, but neither is part of the other. This is impossible because z is completely inside y, which is completely inside x, so z must be completely inside x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This is impossible because y is completely inside x, and z is completely inside y, so there's no way x can be inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z without touching its boundary. Again, impossible because y is inside x, and z is inside y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know z is inside y, which doesn't touch the boundary of x, so z can't touch the boundary of x. This is inconsistent with our constraints.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x without touching its boundary. Given that z is inside y, which is inside x without touching its boundary, this is consistent with our constraints.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This would mean x and z are the same region. But if y is properly inside x, and z is properly inside y, then z can't be the same as x. This is inconsistent.

So, out of all the RCC-8 relations, only NTPPi(x,z) is consistent with our constraints. This confirms my original answer.

Let me first double-check the NTPPi relation.
NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x without touching its boundary. So y is a non-tangential proper part of x, or y is properly within the interior of x. This is consistent with my reasoning above.

So, to summarize: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, hang on. Let me be more careful and take a step back. Let's formulate this more explicitly.

NTPPi(x, y) means NTPP(y, x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y, z) means NTPP(z, y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So we have NTPP(y, x) and NTPP(z, y).

NTPP(a, b) intuitively means a is completely inside the interior of b. So NTPP(y, x) means y is completely inside the interior of x, and NTPP(z, y) means z is completely inside the interior of y.

If z is completely inside the interior of y, and y is completely inside the interior of x, then z must be completely inside the interior of x. So NTPP(z, x).

And NTPP(z, x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x, z).

Wait, let me just double-check everything one more time using the formal definitions. Relation NTPP(a, b) means that a is a non-tangential proper part of b. "Non-tangential" means a doesn't touch the boundary of b. "Proper part" means a is a part of b, and a is not equal to b.

Relation NTPPi(a, b) is the inverse of NTPP(a, b), which means NTPP(b, a). So NTPPi(a, b) means b is a non-tangential proper part of a.

Given:
- NTPPi(x, y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside the interior of x.
- NTPPi(y, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside the interior of y.

If z is completely inside the interior of y, and y is completely inside the interior of x, then z must be completely inside the interior of x. This is NTPP(z, x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x, z).

To be triple sure, let me check if there's any other possible relation that could hold.

1. DC(x, z): Disconnected. This is impossible because if z is inside y, and y is inside x, then z must be inside x. They can't be disconnected.

2. EC(x, z): Externally connected. This is impossible for the same reason. If z is inside y, and y is inside x, then z is inside x, not just touching its boundary.

3. PO(x, z): Partially overlapping. This would mean parts of z are outside of x. But since z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x, z must be completely inside x.

4. TPP(x, z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But we've established that z is inside y, which is inside x. So x can't be inside z.

5. NTPP(x, z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z without touching its boundary. Again, if z is inside y, and y is inside x, it's impossible for x to be inside z.

6. TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But since z is inside y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x either.

7. NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside the interior of x. Given that z is inside y, and y is inside the interior of x, this is consistent.

8. EQ(x, z): x and z are equal. This would mean x and z occupy the same space. But if y is properly inside x, and z is properly inside y, then z must be properly inside x and can't be equal to x.

So, out of all the RCC-8 relations, only NTPPi(x, z) is consistent with the constraints.

So the final answer is: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize that I'm potentially glossing over some subtleties. Let me more careful with the formal definitions.

In the RCC-8 calculus, the relations are defined based on the notion of connectedness. Let's see if that changes anything.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x, y): This means NTPP(y, x), which in the RCC-8 calculus means y is a part of x, and every part of y that's connected to the complement of x is also connected to the interior of x. Intuitively, y is fully inside x, away from the boundary.
2. NTPPi(y, z): This means NTPP(z, y), so z is fully inside y, away from the boundary.

Now, given these, what's the relationship between x and z?

If z is fully inside y, and y is fully inside x, then z must be fully inside x, away from the boundary. This is NTPP(z, x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x, z).

I think the answer is consistently NTPPi(x, z).

Actually, I think this is a transivity question. If we have the relation NTPP (non-tangential proper part), and we know NTPP(y, x) and NTPP(z, y), then NTPP(z, x) follows by the transitivity of the NTPP relation. Equivalently, if NTPPi(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z), then NTPPi(x, z) follows by the transitivity of the NTPPi relation. I should look more carefully to see if there are any other possible relationships.

Given:
1. NTPPi(x, y): y is fully inside x, away from the boundary.
2. NTPPi(y, z): z is fully inside y, away from the boundary.

Let's check all RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): Disconnected. If z is inside y, and y is inside x, then z must be inside x. They can't be disconnected.

2. EC(x, z): Externally connected. This would mean z touches the boundary of x but doesn't share interior points. But since z is inside y, and y is away from the boundary of x, z can't touch the boundary of x.

3. PO(x, z): Partially overlapping. This would mean z and x share some interior points, but neither is fully inside the other. But since z is fully inside y, and y is fully inside x, z must be fully inside x.

4. TPP(x, z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But z is inside y, which is inside x, so x can't be inside z.

5. NTPP(x, z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is fully inside z, away from the boundary. Again, since z is inside y, and y is inside x, x can't be inside z.

6. TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But z is inside y, and y is away from the boundary of x, so z can't touch the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x, away from the boundary. Given that z is inside y, and y is fully inside x away from the boundary, z must be fully inside x away from the boundary.

8. EQ(x, z): x and z are equal. This would mean x and z are the same region. But if y is properly inside x, and z is properly inside y, then z must be properly inside x and can't be equal to x.

So, out of all the RCC-8 relations, only NTPPi(x, z) is consistent with the constraints.

To summarize, if NTPPi(x, y) and NTPPi(y, z), then the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x, z).

The answer is NTPPi(x, z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship(s) could exist between x and z given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary

Let me analyze this step by step:

Given these two conditions, z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x, both without touching their respective container's boundaries.

This means z must be:
1. Completely inside x (since it's inside y which is inside x)
2. Not touching x's boundary (since z doesn't even touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary)

Looking at all possible RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,z): Impossible since z is inside x
- EC(x,z): Impossible since z can't touch x's boundary
- PO(x,z): Impossible since z is completely inside x
- TPP(x,z): Impossible since x can't be inside z
- NTPP(x,z): Impossible since x can't be inside z
- TPPi(x,z): Impossible since z can't touch x's boundary
- NTPPi(x,z): Consistent with our constraints
- EQ(x,z): Impossible since z is properly inside x

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
