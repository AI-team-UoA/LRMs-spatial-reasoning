PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think carefully about this problem. We know that
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected
- PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap

We need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Given that DC(x,y), we know that x and y share no spatial parts. They are completely separate regions.

Given that PO(y,z), we know that y and z share some spatial parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. That means some parts of y are not in z, and some parts of z are not in y.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since x is disconnected from y, and y partially overlaps with z, x could potentially have various relationships with z. Let's analyze the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): x could be disconnected from z. This is certainly possible if x is far away from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): x could externally connect with z (touch at boundary). This is possible if x touches z at a boundary point, but doesn't touch y.

3. PO(x,z): x could partially overlap with z. This is possible if x overlaps with parts of z that don't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside the portion of z that doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is entirely contained in z without touching z's boundary. Again, this is possible if x is deep inside the portion of z that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is entirely inside x, and y overlaps with just the part of z that touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is entirely contained in x without touching x's boundary. This is possible if z is deep inside x, and y only overlaps with z without touching x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal. This doesn't seem possible because if x and z were equal, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would also partially overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

Wait, I need to be more careful about TPPi and NTPPi. Let's think about these cases more carefully.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is entirely contained in x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x as well, which contradicts DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, if z is entirely contained in x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me also double-check the EQ(x,z) case again. If x and z were equal, and PO(y,z), then y would partially overlap with x. But we know DC(x,y), which means x and y are disconnected. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Now let's check the remaining possibilities again:

1. DC(x,z): Definitely possible. x could be completely separate from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries. Given that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x could touch z at a part of z's boundary that doesn't include y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Given that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x could overlap with parts of z that don't overlap with y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Given that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x could be entirely contained in the portion of z that doesn't overlap with y, and touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Given that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x could be entirely contained deep inside the portion of z that doesn't overlap with y. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me double-check the TPP and NTPP cases more carefully.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary. Given that DC(x,y), x cannot be in the part of z that overlaps with y. So x would need to be in the part of z that doesn't overlap with y. This is possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would need to be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary. Again, given that DC(x,y), x cannot be in the part of z that overlaps with y. So x would need to be deep inside the part of z that doesn't overlap with y. This is also possible.

So I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, I made a mistake in my reasoning about the TPPi and NTPPi cases. Let me think more carefully.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. If z is entirely contained in x, and y partially overlaps with z, then part of y would be inside x. But this contradicts DC(x,y), which says x and y are disconnected. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is entirely contained in x without touching x's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z, then part of y would be inside x. This again contradicts DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Let me double-check my analysis once more, just to be sure.

DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected - they share no spatial parts.
PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap - they share some spatial parts, but neither is fully contained in the other.

So we have x disjoint from y, and y partially overlapping with z.

For the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x can be disconnected from z. This is clearly possible if x is far away from both y and z.

2. EC(x,z): x can externally connect with z (touch at boundary). This is possible if x touches z at a boundary point, but doesn't touch y.

3. PO(x,z): x can partially overlap with z. This is possible if x overlaps with parts of z that don't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside the portion of z that doesn't overlap with y, and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is entirely contained in z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is deep inside the portion of z that doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. But if z is entirely in x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is entirely contained in x without touching x's boundary. Again, if z is entirely in x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z can be equal. If x and z were equal, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would have to partially overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

To summarize:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x is disconnected from z
- EC(x,z): x externally connects with z
- PO(x,z): x partially overlaps with z
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Let's check my logic one more time:

1. DC(x,z): Since DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x could be completely separate from z. This is clearly possible.

2. EC(x,z): Since DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x could touch z at a boundary but not overlap, while still being separate from y. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): Since DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x could partially overlap with z in the parts where z doesn't overlap with y. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Since DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x could be entirely contained in the part of z that doesn't overlap with y, and touch z's boundary. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Since DC(x,y) and PO(y,z), x could be entirely contained deep inside the part of z that doesn't overlap with y. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained in x and touches x's boundary. But if z is entirely in x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained in x without touching x's boundary. Again, if z is entirely in x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are identical. If x and z were identical, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

The possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that DC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Since x is disconnected from y, x could be completely separate from z as well.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. x could touch z at its boundary while remaining disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x could overlap with parts of z that don't overlap with y.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be contained within z (touching z's boundary) in areas where z doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be fully inside z (not touching z's boundary) in areas where z doesn't overlap with y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were a tangential proper part of x, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were a non-tangential proper part of x, then y (which partially overlaps z) would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, and y partially overlaps with z, then y would have to overlap with x, contradicting DC(x,y).
