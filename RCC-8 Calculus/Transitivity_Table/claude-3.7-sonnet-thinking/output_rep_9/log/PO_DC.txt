PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let's recall the definitions of the RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): Same as TPP(y,x), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): Same as NTPP(y,x), so y is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (the same region).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is contained in the other.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.

Let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if the parts of x that are not shared with y are also disconnected from z. Since y and z are disconnected, the parts of x that overlap with y must be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches z at a boundary but doesn't share interior parts. The part of x that is shared with y must not touch z (since y and z are disconnected), but other parts of x could touch z at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if x and z share a spatial part but neither is contained in the other. The part of x that is shared with y can't overlap with z (since y and z are disconnected), but other parts of x could overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if the parts of x that are not shared with y are all contained in z, and some part of x touches z's boundary. The part of x that is shared with y can't be part of z (since y and z are disconnected).

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is not possible because x shares a part with y, and y is disconnected from z. So x can't be entirely contained within z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is entirely contained within the parts of x that are not shared with y, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is entirely contained within the parts of x that are not shared with y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is not possible because x shares a part with y, and y is disconnected from z. So x can't be the same as z.

Let me double-check the cases where I'm unsure:

For NTPP(x,z), I said it's not possible. Let's verify: If NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But since PO(x,y), x shares a part with y. That shared part would have to be part of z too, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

For TPP(x,z), I said it's possible. Let's verify: If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Since PO(x,y), x shares a part with y. That shared part would have to be part of z too, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible either.

Let me reconsider my analysis:

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), we know that:
- x and y share a part, but neither is contained in the other.
- y and z are disconnected, sharing no parts.

For x and z, the possibilities are:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible because the part of x that overlaps with y must be disconnected from z (since y and z are disconnected), and the rest of x could also be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is possible because the part of x that overlaps with y must be disconnected from z, but other parts of x could touch z at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a part, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible because the part of x that overlaps with y must be disconnected from z, but other parts of x could overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. If x is entirely contained in z, then the part of x that overlaps with y would also be contained in z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to TPP, this is not possible because it would contradict DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible because z could be contained within the parts of x that don't overlap with y, and z could touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible because z could be contained within the parts of x that don't overlap with y, and z might not touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is not possible because x shares a part with y, and y is disconnected from z. So x can't be the same as z.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double-check this by drawing some simple diagrams or thinking of concrete examples:

Imagine y is a circle in the center. 
- x is a circle that partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)). 
- z is a circle that is completely separate from y (DC(y,z)).

Now, considering the different possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): z could be completely separate from both x and y. This works.

2. EC(x,z): z could touch the boundary of x at a point, but be disconnected from y. This works.

3. PO(x,z): z could overlap with the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. This works.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is entirely contained in z. But since part of x overlaps with y, and y is disconnected from z, this is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained in x. This is possible if z is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is entirely contained in x but doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible if z is in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, and z is completely interior to x.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since x overlaps with y, and y is disconnected from z, this is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just double check once again that I haven't made a mistake about TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z): If x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, then all of x is contained in z. But since PO(x,y), part of x overlaps with y. If all of x is in z, then that overlapping part would also be in z, which would mean y and z share a part. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z): Similarly, if x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary, all of x is contained in z. This would again mean that the part of x that overlaps with y is also in z, contradicting DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z, given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which spatial relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is contained in the other
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts

Let me analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x could be completely disconnected from z
2. EC(x,z): Possible - x could touch z at a boundary without sharing interior parts
3. PO(x,z): Possible - x could overlap with z in areas where x doesn't overlap with y
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible - if x were contained in z, the part of x that overlaps with y would also be in z, contradicting DC(y,z)
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - same reasoning as TPP
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z could be contained in the portion of x that doesn't overlap with y
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z could be properly contained within x without touching x's boundary
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x and z were identical, z would share parts with y, contradicting DC(y,z)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
