PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), and I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Let me recall the definition of PO: PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

So, from PO(x,y), we know that:
- x and y share a spatial part
- x is not a part of y
- y is not a part of x

And from PO(y,z), we know that:
- y and z share a spatial part
- y is not a part of z
- z is not a part of y

Now, let me think about the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. Is this possible? Yes, it's possible that x and y share a part, and y and z share a different part, but x and z don't share any part.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is possible if, for example, x and y overlap in one region, y and z overlap in a different region, and x and z only touch at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is certainly possible. For instance, if x, y, and z all share a common region, but each also has parts that are not shared with the others.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? Given that x is not a part of y and y is not a part of z, I don't think we can definitively say x is a part of z. But it's not ruled out either. It's possible that parts of x that don't overlap with y are contained within z, making x a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to the reasoning above, this is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Similar to the reasoning for TPP, this is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the reasoning for NTPP, this is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. Is this possible? Well, if x and y share a part and y and z share a part, and if the parts of x that don't overlap with y are the same as the parts of z that don't overlap with y, then x and z could be identical.

So, to sum up, all RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me think about this a bit more carefully, especially for the part-of relations.

Given PO(x,y), we know that x has a part that's not in y and y has a part that's not in x. Similarly, from PO(y,z), we know that y has a part that's not in z and z has a part that's not in y.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, all of x must be inside z. But we know that some part of x doesn't overlap with y, and if this part is not inside z, then TPP(x,z) can't hold. However, it's not guaranteed that this part of x must be outside z. It's quite possible that all of x, including the part that doesn't overlap with y, is contained within z. So, TPP(x,z) is still a possibility.

Similar reasoning applies to NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z). They are all possible relations given the constraints.

For EQ(x,z), both x and z need to be identical. Since x has a part that doesn't overlap with y and z has a part that doesn't overlap with y, if these non-overlapping parts are the same and the overlapping parts are also the same, then x and z can be identical. So, EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

In conclusion, given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), all RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

Actually, let me think about this problem more carefully.

From PO(x,y), we know:
- x and y share a spatial part, call it A.
- x has a part, call it B, that's not in y.
- y has a part, call it C, that's not in x.

From PO(y,z), we know:
- y and z share a spatial part, call it D.
- y has a part, call it E, that's not in z.
- z has a part, call it F, that's not in y.

Now, the spatial part that y and z share (D) might or might not overlap with the spatial part that x and y share (A). Let's consider both cases.

Case 1: A and D have no overlap.
In this case, the part of y that overlaps with x is separate from the part that overlaps with z. So, x and z don't share any spatial part. This means DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) are the possible relations.

Case 2: A and D have some overlap.
In this case, there's a part of y that overlaps with both x and z, which means x and z share a spatial part. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z). The relation could be PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), or EQ(x,z).

Let's see if we can narrow down Case 2 further.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, all of x must be inside z, and x must touch the boundary of z. From our analysis, we know that x has a part B that's not in y. For TPP(x,z) to be true, this part B must be entirely within z. That's certainly a possibility, but not a necessity based on the given constraints.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z), whether they are possible depends on the specific configuration of the regions.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be identical. Given that x has a part B that's not in y and z has a part F that's not in y, if B and F are the same, and the overlapping parts are also the same, then x and z can be identical.

So, to conclude, given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ. All of them are possible depending on the specific configuration of the regions.

Actually, let me be a bit more rigorous about this. I need to determine which of the 8 RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z, given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

First, I note that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) don't give us complete information about the shapes of x, y, and z. So there might be multiple possible relations between x and z, depending on how these shapes are configured.

Let me consider each of the 8 RCC-8 relations and determine if it's possible for it to hold between x and z.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? Yes. Consider a scenario where x and y overlap in a region that doesn't include any part of z, and y and z overlap in a region that doesn't include any part of x. In this case, x and z would be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected. Is this possible? Yes. Consider a scenario where x and y overlap in a region that comes up to the boundary of z, and y and z overlap in a region that comes up to the boundary of x, but x and z themselves only touch at a boundary. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Is this possible? Yes. Consider a scenario where the region of overlap between x and y intersects with the region of overlap between y and z. In this case, there would be a part common to all three regions. Additionally, x would have parts not in z and z would have parts not in x. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. Is this possible? Yes. Imagine a scenario where x is completely contained within z, touching the boundary of z, and y overlaps with both x and z in such a way that neither y is contained in x nor x is contained in y, and neither y is contained in z nor z is contained in y. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Is this possible? Yes. Similar to the TPP case, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. Is this possible? Yes. Just swap the roles of x and z in the TPP case. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Is this possible? Yes. Just swap the roles of x and z in the NTPP case. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. Is this possible? Yes. Imagine a scenario where x and z are the exact same region, and y overlaps with them partially. So EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

So, all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Just to be sure, let me verify with specific examples for a few of the cases:

DC(x,z): 
Let's consider x, y, and z as circles. Place y in the middle, and x on the left such that it overlaps with the left part of y. Place z on the right such that it overlaps with the right part of y. If the distance between the centers of x and z is large enough, x and z will be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z): 
Adjust the position of x and z from the previous example so that they just touch each other. So EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z): 
Adjust the position of x and z further so that they overlap, but not entirely. So PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): 
Consider x as a small circle on the left boundary of a large circle z. Let y be another circle that overlaps with both x and z but is not contained in either. Here, x is a tangential proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): 
Move x from the previous example to the center of z. Now, x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z): 
Swap the roles of x and z in the TPP and NTPP examples. So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.

EQ(x,z): 
Consider x and z to be the same circle, and y to be another circle that overlaps with x (and hence z). So EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, to conclude, given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), all RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I need to be careful about the definitions, especially for the case of EQ(x,z). Let me recheck.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical regions. Given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), for EQ(x,z) to be true, we need to consider if it's possible for x and z to be the exact same region. If x and z are the same, then the relationship between x and y is the same as the relationship between z and y. But we're given that both relations are PO. So, it's entirely possible for x and z to be the same region, and for both to have a PO relationship with y. For example, imagine y as a large circle, and x (which is the same as z) as another circle that overlaps with y but is not contained in y, and y is not contained in x.

So, to conclude, given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), all RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, upon thinking more, I realized I've approached this problem a bit hastily. Let me try to systematically verify each potential relation between x and z.

Let's define regions x, y, and z as composed of atomic regions for clarity. Let's denote the atomic region that's in x, y, and z as 'xyz', the region that's in x and y but not z as 'xy', and so on. So we have the following atomic regions:
- xyz: present in all three
- xy: present in x and y, but not z
- xz: present in x and z, but not y
- yz: present in y and z, but not x
- x: present only in x
- y: present only in y
- z: present only in z

The conditions PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) give us:
1. x and y overlap, so either 'xyz' or 'xy' (or both) must exist.
2. y has parts not in x, so either 'yz' or 'y' (or both) must exist.
3. x has parts not in y, so either 'xz' or 'x' (or both) must exist.
4. y and z overlap, so either 'xyz' or 'yz' (or both) must exist.
5. z has parts not in y, so either 'xz' or 'z' (or both) must exist.
6. y has parts not in z, so either 'xy' or 'y' (or both) must exist.

Now, let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z and see if it's consistent with these conditions.

DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any parts. This means 'xyz' and 'xz' don't exist. From condition 3, 'x' must exist. From condition 5, 'z' must exist. From condition 1, 'xy' must exist. From condition 4, 'yz' must exist. So, the atomic regions are 'xy', 'yz', 'x', 'y', 'z', which is consistent. So DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z): In the RCC-8 calculus, regions are considered as sets of points. For EC(x,z), x and z share boundary points but no interior points. Using our atomic regions, this is the same as DC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z): This means x and z share parts, and each has parts not in the other. This means either 'xyz' or 'xz' (or both) must exist. From condition 3, either 'xz' or 'x' (or both) must exist. From condition 5, either 'xz' or 'z' (or both) must exist. All these conditions can be simultaneously satisfied. So PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. In terms of our atomic regions, this means 'x', 'xz', and 'xyz' can exist, but 'xy' can't exist (since every part of x must be in z). But from condition 1, either 'xyz' or 'xy' must exist. If 'xyz' exists, then 'xy' doesn't need to exist. So, TPP(x,z) is possible only if 'xyz' exists, 'xy' doesn't exist, and x touches the boundary of z.

Actually, let me reconsider this from a slightly different angle.

From PO(x,y), we know that x and y overlap, but neither is fully contained in the other. Similarly, from PO(y,z), y and z overlap, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Let's consider each of the 8 RCC-8 relations between x and z and determine if they're possible.

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. For this to be consistent with the given conditions, y must overlap with x in a region that doesn't include z, and y must overlap with z in a region that doesn't include x. This is definitely possible. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected, sharing only boundary points. Similar to the DC case, y can overlap with x and z in separate regions, but now x and z touch at a boundary. This is possible. So, EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. For this to be consistent, y might overlap with the region where x and z overlap, or y might overlap with x and z separately. Either way, this is possible. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. For this to be consistent, y must overlap with x, and might also overlap with z outside of x. Since x is a tangential proper part of z, all of x is inside z, which means the overlap between x and y is also inside z. This is possible. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to the TPP case, y can overlap with x and might also overlap with z outside of x. This is possible. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. For this to be consistent, y must overlap with z, and might also overlap with x outside of z. This is possible. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similar to the TPPi case, y can overlap with z and might also overlap with x outside of z. This is possible. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are identical. For this to be consistent, y must overlap with x (which is the same as z) but neither y is contained in x nor x is contained in y. This is possible. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

In conclusion, given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Actually, I'm second-guessing myself. Let me check again with respect to the definitions of the RCC-8 relations. 

First, RCC-8 relations are based on the concept of connection (denoted by C). Two regions are connected if they share at least one point. Using connection, other relations are defined:

- DC(x,y): not C(x,y), meaning x and y do not share any points.
- EC(x,y): C(x,y) and the interiors of x and y do not overlap, meaning x and y touch only at their boundaries.
- PO(x,y): The interiors of x and y overlap, and neither is contained in the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and shares a boundary point with the exterior of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not share any points with the exterior of y.
- TPPi(x,y): Inverse of TPP, i.e., TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y): Inverse of NTPP, i.e., NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.

Given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), let's see which of these relations are possible for x and z.

DC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to not share any points? Yes, consider a scenario where x and y overlap in a region that's completely separate from where y and z overlap. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to share boundary points but not interior points? Yes, similar to the DC case, but now x and z touch at their boundaries. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z): Is it possible for the interiors of x and z to overlap, with neither contained in the other? Yes, consider a scenario where the overlap between x and y intersects with the overlap between y and z. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a proper part of z and to share a boundary point with the exterior of z? Yes, consider a scenario where x is inside z, touching the boundary of z, and y overlaps with x and extends outside of z. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a proper part of z and not share any points with the exterior of z? Yes, similar to the TPP case, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a proper part of x and to share a boundary point with the exterior of x? Yes, just swap the roles of x and z in the TPP case. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a proper part of x and not share any points with the exterior of x? Yes, just swap the roles of x and z in the NTPP case. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

EQ(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be the same region? Yes, consider a scenario where x and z are identical, and y overlaps with them but neither is contained in the other. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

Actually, I need to make sure that the conditions for PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are properly maintained. Let me check each case again:

PO(x,y) means:
- The interiors of x and y overlap.
- x is not a part of y.
- y is not a part of x.

PO(y,z) means:
- The interiors of y and z overlap.
- y is not a part of z.
- z is not a part of y.

Now, let's check each possible relation between x and z again:

DC(x,z): This means x and z do not share any points.
Is this consistent with the given conditions? Yes. For example, place y in the middle, and x and z on opposite sides of y such that x overlaps with the left half of y, and z overlaps with the right half of y. If x and z are sufficiently far apart, they won't share any points. So, DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z): This means x and z touch only at their boundaries.
Is this consistent with the given conditions? Yes. Adjust the DC scenario slightly so that x and z just touch. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z): This means the interiors of x and z overlap, and neither is contained in the other.
Is this consistent with the given conditions? Yes. For example, place y, x, and z such that they all have a common overlap region, but each also has regions not shared with the others. So, PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and shares a boundary point with the exterior of z.
Is this consistent with the given conditions? Yes. For example, place x inside z such that x touches the boundary of z, and y overlaps with a part of x and extends outside of z. Since x is inside z, the overlap between x and y is also inside z. This doesn't contradict any of the given conditions. So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't share any points with the exterior of z.
Is this consistent with the given conditions? Yes. Adjust the TPP scenario so that x is completely inside z without touching the boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and shares a boundary point with the exterior of x.
Is this consistent with the given conditions? Yes. Just swap the roles of x and z in the TPP scenario. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't share any points with the exterior of x.
Is this consistent with the given conditions? Yes. Just swap the roles of x and z in the NTPP scenario. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region.
Is this consistent with the given conditions? Yes. If x and z are the same region, and both have a PO relationship with y, there's no contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, to conclude, given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

To triple-check that I've not made a mistake, let me think through the problem with specific region configurations (I'll represent regions as sets of points or shapes):

DC(x,z):
Let y be a rectangle. Let x be a circle overlapping with the left half of y, and let z be a circle overlapping with the right half of y. If the distance between the centers of x and z is large enough, x and z won't share any points. In this setup:
- The interiors of x and y overlap.
- x is not a part of y (since some of x is outside y).
- y is not a part of x (since some of y is outside x).
- The interiors of y and z overlap.
- y is not a part of z (since some of y is outside z).
- z is not a part of y (since some of z is outside y).
- x and z don't share any points.
So, DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z):
Adjust the DC scenario so that x and z just touch. The conditions for PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) are still satisfied. So, EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z):
Let y, x, and z be three circles of the same size, placed such that each circle overlaps with a part of the other two. In this setup:
- The interiors of x and y overlap.
- x is not a part of y.
- y is not a part of x.
- The interiors of y and z overlap.
- y is not a part of z.
- z is not a part of y.
- The interiors of x and z overlap.
- x is not a part of z.
- z is not a part of x.
So, PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z):
Let z be a large circle, and x be a smaller circle placed inside z such that x touches the boundary of z. Let y be a third circle that overlaps with x and extends outside of z. In this setup:
- The interiors of x and y overlap.
- x is not a part of y (since some of x is outside y).
- y is not a part of x (since some of y is outside x).
- The interiors of y and z overlap.
- y is not a part of z (since some of y is outside z).
- z is not a part of y (since some of z is outside y).
- x is a tangential proper part of z.
So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z):
Adjust the TPP scenario so that x is completely inside z without touching the boundary. The conditions for PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) can still be satisfied. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z):
Swap the roles of x and z in the TPP scenario. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

NTPPi(x,z):
Swap the roles of x and z in the NTPP scenario. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

EQ(x,z):
Let x and z be the same circle, and y be another circle that overlaps with x/z but neither is contained in the other. In this setup:
- The interiors of x and y overlap.
- x is not a part of y.
- y is not a part of x.
- The interiors of y and z overlap.
- y is not a part of z.
- z is not a part of y.
- x is the same as z, so EQ(x,z) holds.
So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

In conclusion, given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), all 8 RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

Possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z):
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

From PO(x,y), I know:
- x and y share a spatial part
- x is not a part of y
- y is not a part of x

From PO(y,z), I know:
- y and z share a spatial part
- y is not a part of z
- z is not a part of y

Let me check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Example: x overlaps with the left side of y, z overlaps with the right side of y, with no overlap between x and z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. Example: Similar to DC case, but x and z touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. Example: Three overlapping circles where each pair shares some region.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. Example: x inside z touching z's boundary, with y overlapping x and extending outside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. Example: Similar to TPP but x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. Example: z inside x touching x's boundary, with y overlapping z and extending outside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. Example: Similar to TPPi but z doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. Example: x and z are identical, both partially overlapping with y.
