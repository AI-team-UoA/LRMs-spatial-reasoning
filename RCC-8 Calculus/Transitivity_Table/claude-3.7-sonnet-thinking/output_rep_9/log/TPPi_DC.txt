PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me first recall the definitions of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), so y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

We know:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, they share no spatial parts.

Now I need to determine what relationship(s) could hold between x and z.

Given that y is part of x and y is disconnected from z, there are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected. This is possible if all of x (including the part y) is disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z could externally connect. This is possible if some part of x (but not y) touches z at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap. This is possible if some part of x (but not y) overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible because y is part of x, and if x were part of z, then y would also be part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is contained within x but does not overlap with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is fully contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and doesn't overlap with y.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal. This isn't possible because if x and z were equal, and y is part of x, then y would also be part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check this reasoning carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is fully contained within x, and y touches the boundary of x.

DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected, they have no parts in common.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. Since y is part of x and y is disconnected from z, it's possible that all of x is disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. This is possible. If y is in the interior of x and doesn't touch the part of x's boundary that touches z, then x and z can be externally connected while y and z remain disconnected.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. If the overlapping part of x and z doesn't include y, then y and z can remain disconnected.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is part of z, and y is part of x, then y would be part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So this isn't possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For the same reason as TPP(x,z), this isn't possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. If z is contained within x but doesn't overlap with y, and z touches the boundary of x, then z can be a tangential proper part of x while y and z remain disconnected.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible. If z is fully contained within x, doesn't touch the boundary of x, and doesn't overlap with y, then z can be a non-tangential proper part of x while y and z remain disconnected.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. If x and z were equal, and y is part of x, then y would be part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So this isn't possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me check this more carefully:

1. DC(x,z): If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is disconnected from z, then it's possible for x to be disconnected from z. For instance, if z is far away from both x and y. 

2. EC(x,z): If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is disconnected from z, then it's possible for x to externally connect with z. For instance, if z touches x at a point on x's boundary that y doesn't touch.

3. PO(x,z): If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is disconnected from z, then it's possible for x to partially overlap with z. For instance, if a part of x that doesn't include y overlaps with z.

4. TPPi(x,z): If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is disconnected from z, then it's possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x. For instance, if z is contained within x, touches x's boundary, but doesn't overlap with y.

5. NTPPi(x,z): If y is a tangential proper part of x, and y is disconnected from z, then it's possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x. For instance, if z is fully contained within x, doesn't touch x's boundary, and doesn't overlap with y.

Actually, I need to be more precise with my reasoning here, particularly regarding the constraint that y touches the boundary of x (since TPPi(x,y)).

If y touches the boundary of x, and z is disconnected from y, that would seem to constrain z from certain configurations where it might be "on the other side" of y. But I think the above relations are still possible.

Let's think about a 2D case:

Imagine x as a square and y as a smaller square inside x, with one edge of y aligned with one edge of x (so y touches the boundary of x). Now, z could be:

1. DC(x,z): A square outside of x, not touching x. Clearly, z is disconnected from y as well.

2. EC(x,z): A square outside of x, but touching x at a point on x's boundary that y doesn't touch. For instance, if y touches the left edge of x, z could touch the right, top, or bottom edge of x.

3. PO(x,z): A square that partially overlaps with x, but in a region of x that doesn't include y. For instance, if y is in the bottom-left corner of x, z could overlap with the top-right part of x.

4. TPPi(x,z): A square inside x, touching x's boundary at a point that y doesn't touch, and not overlapping with y. For instance, if y is in the bottom-left corner of x, z could be in the top-right corner of x, touching the top and right edges of x.

5. NTPPi(x,z): A square fully inside x, not touching x's boundary, and not overlapping with y. For instance, if y is in the bottom-left corner of x, z could be a small square in the center of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I need to revisit my analysis. 

Let's think about this more systematically. We have that TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), and we want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. Specifically, y is a proper part of x (meaning y is fully contained within x and is not equal to x), and y touches the boundary of x.

DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected. They share no parts and do not touch.

Now, let's go through each of the RCC-8 relations and see if it's possible for that relation to hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected? Yes. If y is disconnected from z, and y is part of x, then it's possible for the entirety of x to be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z externally connect? Yes. It's possible for x to touch z at the boundary without y touching z, especially since y only touches part of x's boundary, not all of it. However, I need to double-check this.

Actually, I'm not sure now about EC(x,z). Let's think more about this:

We know that y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y touches the boundary of x. And we know that y is disconnected from z. If x and z externally connect (touch at the boundary), could y still be disconnected from z?

Yes, this is possible. Imagine x as a square, y as a smaller square inside x touching the left edge of x, and z as a square outside of x touching the right edge of x. In this case, EC(x,z) holds, and DC(y,z) also holds.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap? Yes. If the overlapping part of x and z doesn't include y, then y and z can remain disconnected. For instance, if y is in the bottom-left corner of x, and z overlaps with the top-right part of x.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z? If x is part of z, and y is part of x, then y would be part of z (by transitivity). But this contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) isn't possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z? Like TPP(x,z), this would mean y is part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) isn't possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x? Yes. If z is contained within x, touches x's boundary, and doesn't overlap with y, then TPPi(x,z) is possible. For instance, if y is in the bottom-left corner of x, z could be in the top-right corner of x, touching the top and right edges of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes. If z is fully contained within x, doesn't touch x's boundary, and doesn't overlap with y, then NTPPi(x,z) is possible. For instance, if y is in the bottom-left corner of x, z could be a small square in the center of x.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are equal? If x and z were equal, and y is part of x, then y would be part of z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So EQ(x,z) isn't possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

To double-check, let's visualize a few specific cases to confirm:

1. DC(x,z): Let x be a square with y as a smaller square inside touching the left edge of x. Let z be a square completely outside and not touching x. Clearly, y and z are disconnected, and x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Let x be a square with y as a smaller square inside touching the left edge of x. Let z be a square outside x but touching the right edge of x. Here, y and z are disconnected, and x and z externally connect.

3. PO(x,z): Let x be a square with y as a smaller square inside touching the left edge of x. Let z be a square that overlaps with the right half of x but not with y. Here, y and z are disconnected, and x and z partially overlap.

4. TPPi(x,z): Let x be a square with y as a smaller square inside touching the left edge of x. Let z be a smaller square inside x, touching the right edge of x, and not overlapping with y. Here, y and z are disconnected, and z is a tangential proper part of x.

5. NTPPi(x,z): Let x be a square with y as a smaller square inside touching the left edge of x. Let z be a small square fully inside x, not touching the boundary of x, and not overlapping with y. Here, y and z are disconnected, and z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

All of these configurations satisfy TPPi(x,y) and DC(y,z), and they represent each of the five possible relations between x and z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

These are the five possible relations.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what's possible given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (they share no parts and don't touch)

Let me determine possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. If y is inside x and disconnected from z, x could be entirely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If y touches only part of x's boundary, x could touch z at a different part of its boundary while y remains disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x could partially overlap with z in regions that don't include y.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were part of z, then y would be part of z (by transitivity), contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be contained in x, touch x's boundary, but not overlap with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z could be completely contained within x without touching x's boundary and without overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, y would be part of z, contradicting DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
