PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully analyze the given conditions and determine the possible relations between x and z.

We are told that:
1. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y), that means x and y are the same spatial region. And since TPP(y,z), we know that y is a tangential proper part of z.

Given that x and y are coincident (exactly the same), and y is a tangential proper part of z, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be:
TPP(x,z)

Let me double-check this by reasoning through the properties of these relations:

EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical regions.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Since x is identical to y (from EQ(x,y)), and y is a tangential proper part of z, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

So the answer is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relation(s) hold between x and z given the conditions EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Since EQ(x,y), this means that x and y are exactly the same spatial region - they coincide completely.

Since TPP(y,z), this means that y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary).

Because x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), whatever relation y has with z, x must have the same relation with z. 

Since y is a tangential proper part of z, and x is identical to y, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
