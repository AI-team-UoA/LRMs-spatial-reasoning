PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

Let me think about what these conditions mean spatially:
- DC(x,y) means x and y have no common points
- TPP(y,z) means y is completely contained in z, and y touches the boundary of z

Now I need to determine what constraints these place on the relation between x and z.

Since y is completely contained in z (TPP(y,z)), and x has no overlap with y (DC(x,y)), I need to consider all possible ways x can be positioned relative to z.

Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is possible - x could be completely outside of z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connected (touching at boundary).
   This is possible - x could be outside of z but touching its boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible - x could partially overlap with z in areas where y is not present.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible - x could be completely inside z and touching z's boundary, while still being disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible - x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while still being disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? If z contains y, and y is disconnected from x, then z cannot be contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   For the same reason as above, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   If x and z were equal, then y would be a tangential proper part of x. But we know that x and y are disconnected, so y cannot be part of x. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z externally connected
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z

Let me just double-check these conclusions:

For DC(x,z): Yes, x could be entirely outside z while y is inside z.

For EC(x,z): Yes, x could be touching the boundary of z from the outside, while y is inside z.

For PO(x,z): Yes, x could partially overlap with z in regions where y is not present.

For TPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is also a tangential proper part of z, and x and y are disconnected, this is possible if x and y are in different parts of z but both touch z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z): This means x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if x is in the "interior" of z, away from both y and z's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z): None of these are possible because they would require z to be part of or equal to x, which would mean y is at least partially within x (since y is part of z), contradicting DC(x,y).

So my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. I need to be precise about the constraints.

Given:
1. DC(x,y): x and y have no points in common
2. TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

For DC(x,z): This means x and z have no points in common. But TPP(y,z) means y is inside z. Since DC(x,y), x and y have no points in common. But this doesn't necessarily mean x and z have no points in common. x could still overlap with parts of z where y is not present. So DC(x,z) is possible.

For EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Again, since y is only part of z, x could touch z at a point on z's boundary that is not occupied by y. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. Since y is only part of z, x could overlap with parts of z where y is not present, while still being disconnected from y. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Since y is also part of z, and DC(x,y) means x and y don't overlap, it's possible for x to be a different part of z that doesn't overlap with y. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, since y is only part of z, and DC(x,y) means x and y don't overlap, x could be in a different part of z's interior that doesn't overlap with y. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. But we know that y is part of z (TPP(y,z)). If z were part of x, then y would also be part of x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this would imply y is part of x, contradicting DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. But TPP(y,z) means y is part of z, which would make y part of x as well, contradicting DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me be even more careful.

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (no common points)
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z, touching z's boundary)

Now for each possible relation between x and z:

DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
If x and z are disconnected, then x and y must also be disconnected (since y is inside z). This is consistent with our given DC(x,y). So DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected:
If x and z touch at their boundaries, x and y could still be disconnected if x touches z at a part of the boundary where y is not present. This is consistent with our given DC(x,y). So EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
If x and z partially overlap, then x could overlap with parts of z where y is not present, maintaining DC(x,y). So PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, it can still be disconnected from y if y is in a different part of z. This maintains DC(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, it can still be disconnected from y if y is in a different part of z. This maintains DC(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, then y must also be inside x (since y is inside z). This contradicts DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y must also be inside x (since y is inside z). This contradicts DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
If x and z are the same region, then y must be inside x (since y is inside z). This contradicts DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I think I made another mistake in my reasoning. Let me try a different approach by thinking about the composition of RCC-8 relations.

We know that DC(x,y) and TPP(y,z). The composition of these relations, denoted DC ∘ TPP, gives us the possible relations between x and z.

According to the RCC-8 composition table, the result of DC ∘ TPP is:
DC ∘ TPP = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP}

This means that if x is disconnected from y, and y is a tangential proper part of z, then x can be:
1. Disconnected from z (DC)
2. Externally connected to z (EC)
3. Partially overlapping with z (PO)
4. A tangential proper part of z (TPP)
5. A non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This confirms my earlier reasoning. The answer is that x and z can be related by any of the following RCC-8 relations: DC, EC, PO, TPP, or NTPP.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (share no points)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can be completely outside z while y is inside z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can touch z's boundary from the outside at a point where y is not touching.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially overlap with z in areas where y is not present.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z and touch z's boundary, while still being disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, while remaining disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible - if z were part of x, then y would also be part of x (since y is part of z), contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible - for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x and z were identical, then y would be part of x, contradicting DC(x,y).
