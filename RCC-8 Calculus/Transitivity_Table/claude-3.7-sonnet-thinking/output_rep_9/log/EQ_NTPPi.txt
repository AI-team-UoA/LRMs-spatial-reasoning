PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what we know:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same region).
- NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y). NTPP(z,y) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is entirely contained within y (without touching the boundary).

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are identical in terms of spatial relationship. So whatever relationship y has with z, x will have the same relationship with z.

We know that NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Since x is identical to y (because EQ(x,y)), it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. That means NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by considering the meaning of the relations more explicitly:

- EQ(x,y): x and y occupy exactly the same region.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means z contains y fully in its interior.

Now, since x and y occupy the same region (EQ(x,y)), if y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x must also be a non-tangential proper part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me clarify the meaning of NTPPi again:

- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is fully contained within y without touching the boundary.

Now, since EQ(x,y), x and y occupy the same region. If z is fully contained within y without touching the boundary, then z is also fully contained within x without touching the boundary. So, NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I think I'm being careless with the definition of NTPPi. Let's be precise.

- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). 

Sorry, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me restate the definitions clearly:

- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y. That is, x is fully contained within y and touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. That is, x is fully contained within y and does not touch the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x).

So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is fully contained within y and does not touch the boundary of y.

Now, considering EQ(x,y), which means x and y occupy the same region, if z is fully contained within y without touching its boundary, then z is also fully contained within x without touching its boundary. So, NTPP(z,x), or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's think about it from another angle to make sure.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means z properly contains y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, since x and y are the same region (due to EQ(x,y)), if y is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is also a non-tangential proper part of z. This means NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

OK, I think I've been making an error in interpreting NTPPi.

NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. So, y is contained within z without touching the boundary.

Given that EQ(x,y), which means x and y are identical regions, if y is fully contained within z without touching its boundary, then x is also fully contained within z without touching its boundary. Therefore, NTPP(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check one more time:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are the same region.
- NTPPi(y,z): Wait, I need to be careful here. NTPPi means the inverse of NTPP. So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is fully contained within y without touching the boundary.

Given that x and y are the same region, if z is fully contained within y without touching the boundary, then z is also fully contained within x without touching the boundary. So, NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

But I'm now doubting my understanding of NTPPi. Let me make sure:
- NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z).
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z.
- So, NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

OK, I was correct before. 

OK, so with NTPPi(y,z), we know that z is a non-tangential proper part of y.
Given EQ(x,y), which means x and y are the same region, if z is a non-tangential proper part of y, then z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. Therefore, NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, this is why I was making a mistake. I need to be careful. Let me define the relations directly so I don't make a mistake again. Let me refer to the original definitions as given:

- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

So NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. 

Given that EQ(x,y), which means x and y are coincident, if z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary, then z is also part of x but does not touch x's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this one more time to be absolutely sure.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same region.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is fully contained within y without touching the boundary of y.

Now, since x and y are coincident (due to EQ(x,y)), they have the same boundaries and the same interiors. If z is fully contained within y without touching the boundary of y, then z must also be fully contained within x without touching the boundary of x. This is because x and y occupy the same region.

Therefore, NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I have been overthinking this. Let's do this step by step:

1. EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident, i.e., they occupy the same region.
2. NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.
3. Since x and y are the same region, the relationship between z and x is the same as the relationship between z and y.
4. Since NTPP(z,y), we have NTPP(z,x).
5. NTPP(z,x) is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

The answer is that x and z have the relationship NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relationships EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) together constrain the possible relationship between x and z.

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (equivalently, z is properly contained within y without touching y's boundary)

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are identical in terms of their spatial extent. This means x has exactly the same relationship with any third object as y does.

We know that NTPPi(y,z), which means z is properly contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y occupy exactly the same region (they're coincident), z must also be properly contained within x without touching x's boundary. This corresponds to NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).
