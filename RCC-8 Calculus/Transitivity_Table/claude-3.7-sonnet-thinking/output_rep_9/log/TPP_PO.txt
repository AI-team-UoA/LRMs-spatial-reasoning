PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think through this step by step.

We have two relationships:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.
2. PO(y,z): y partially overlaps z. This means y and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other.

Now I need to figure out what relationship x could have with z. 

Let's think about the possible positions of x relative to z, given that x is a tangential proper part of y and y partially overlaps with z.

Since x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y partially overlaps with z, there are several possibilities:

1. x could be completely outside z (disconnected from z) - this would be DC(x,z)
2. x could touch z's boundary without overlapping - this would be EC(x,z)
3. x could partially overlap with z - this would be PO(x,z)
4. x could be completely inside z, touching z's boundary - this would be TPP(x,z)
5. x could be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary - this would be NTPP(x,z)

Let me check if any of the inverse relationships (TPPi, NTPPi) or equality (EQ) are possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Since x is a proper part of y, and y shares some parts with z but not all, z cannot be fully contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similarly, this is not possible because x is contained in y.
8. EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same region. This is not possible because y partially overlaps z, but x is fully contained in y.

Now let me double-check this reasoning with some visual thinking.

For TPP(x,y), x is inside y, touching y's boundary.
For PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap.

If y and z partially overlap, and x is inside y touching y's boundary, then:

1. x could be in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z, which would give DC(x,z) if x is completely separated from z.
2. x could be at the boundary between y and z, which would give EC(x,z) if x touches the boundary of z.
3. x could extend into the overlapping region between y and z, which would give PO(x,z).
4. x could be completely in the overlapping region of y and z, touching the boundary of z, which would give TPP(x,z).
5. x could be completely in the overlapping region of y and z, not touching the boundary of z, which would give NTPP(x,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me think once more if NTPP(x,z) is possible. If x touches the boundary of y (since TPP(x,y)), and some part of y's boundary is also the boundary of z (in the overlap region), then x might be touching the boundary of z as well. So NTPP(x,z) would be possible only if x doesn't touch any part of y's boundary that coincides with z's boundary.

Upon reflection, I think NTPP(x,z) is indeed possible. It would happen if x touches y's boundary at a point that doesn't intersect with z's boundary, and x is completely contained within the overlap of y and z.

So my final answer for the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given TPP(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y, touching y's boundary)
- PO(y,z): y partially overlaps with z (they share some parts but neither contains the other)

Possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x could be entirely in the part of y that doesn't overlap with z
2. EC(x,z) - x could touch z's boundary without sharing interior points
3. PO(x,z) - x could partially overlap with z
4. TPP(x,z) - x could be completely inside z, touching z's boundary
5. NTPP(x,z) - x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary

The inverse relations (TPPi, NTPPi) and EQ are impossible because x is contained within y, while z extends outside y.
