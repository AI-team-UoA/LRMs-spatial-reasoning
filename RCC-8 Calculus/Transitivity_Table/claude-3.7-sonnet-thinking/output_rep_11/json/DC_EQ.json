{"prompt": "If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Let me analyze this step by step:\n\n1) DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts\n2) EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (exactly the same region)\n\nSince y and z are exactly the same spatial region (EQ relation means they are identical), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.\n\nGiven that x is disconnected from y (DC relation), and z is identical to y, x must also be disconnected from z.\n\n### Answer: DC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 6.845963954925537, "reasoning-tokens": 438, "completion-tokens": 438}
