{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Given:\n- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (occupy the same space)\n- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (share no spatial parts)\n\nSince x and y are exactly the same spatial entity (they are coincident), and y is disconnected from z, then x must also be disconnected from z.\n\n### Answer: DC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 7.357531547546387, "reasoning-tokens": 461, "completion-tokens": 461}
