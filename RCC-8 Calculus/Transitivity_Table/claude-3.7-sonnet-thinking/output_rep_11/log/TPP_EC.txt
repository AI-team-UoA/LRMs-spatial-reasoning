PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this problem step by step.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected, meaning they touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. 
Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.

Let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - disconnected:
   This is possible if x is inside y but doesn't reach the part of y's boundary that touches z. In this case, x would be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z) - externally connected:
   This is possible if x touches the exact part of y's boundary that also touches z. In this case, x and z would touch at a boundary point (or segment) without overlapping.

3. PO(x,z) - partially overlapping:
   This seems impossible. Since EC(y,z), y and z don't share interior points. And since TPP(x,y), x is entirely inside y. Therefore, x cannot overlap with z's interior.

4. TPP(x,z) - tangential proper part:
   This seems impossible. If x were a tangential proper part of z, it would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But since TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), x is inside y and y only touches z at the boundary, x cannot be inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - non-tangential proper part:
   This is definitely impossible. If x were a non-tangential proper part of z, it would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But since x is inside y and y only touches z at the boundary, x cannot be inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - inverse tangential proper part:
   This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since x is inside y (due to TPP(x,y)) and z is outside y (due to EC(y,z)), z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - inverse non-tangential proper part:
   This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. But since x is inside y and z is outside y, z cannot be inside x.

8. EQ(x,z) - equal:
   This is impossible. If x were equal to z, then x and z would occupy the same space. But since TPP(x,y), x is inside y, and since EC(y,z), z is outside y, x and z cannot be equal.

Based on my reasoning, the only possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.

Let me double-check this:

For DC(x,z): If x is inside y but doesn't reach the part of y's boundary that touches z, then x and z would be disconnected. This seems valid.

For EC(x,z): If x touches the exact part of y's boundary that also touches z, then x and z would touch at a boundary point (or segment) without overlapping. This also seems valid.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

But I'm a bit unsure about TPP(x,z). Let me reconsider. 

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary. However, since TPP(x,y), x is inside y, and since EC(y,z), y and z only touch at a boundary. This means x cannot be inside z, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

I'm also questioning my conclusion about EC(x,z). Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary. And since TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. But does x necessarily touch the part of y's boundary that touches z? Not necessarily. If x touches a different part of y's boundary, then x and z would be disconnected.

Actually, let's consider the possible configurations in a bit more detail:

Since TPP(x,y), x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.

Now, there are two possibilities:
1. x touches the part of y's boundary that touches z. In this case, x and z would also touch at a boundary, so EC(x,z).
2. x doesn't touch the part of y's boundary that touches z. In this case, x and z would be completely disconnected, so DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

But wait, there's another possibility I'm missing. What if x overlaps with z? Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. And since TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. If x touches the part of y's boundary that touches z, and if x extends in a way that it also overlaps with z, then PO(x,z) would be possible.

But no, this can't be right. Since EC(y,z), y and z don't share interior points. This means there's no part of z inside y. And since TPP(x,y), x is entirely inside y. So, x cannot overlap with z, ruling out PO(x,z).

But maybe can z overlap with x? If z extends beyond the boundary of y, and if x touches that part of y's boundary where z also touches, then x and z might overlap. But again, since EC(y,z), z doesn't share interior points with y, so z cannot overlap with x.

So, my conclusion remains the same: the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Hmm, let me step back and think more carefully. I think I've been overthinking this.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. This means they touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.

Given these, what are the possible configurations of x and z?

Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.

There are two cases:
1. x touches the part of y's boundary that touches z.
2. x touches a different part of y's boundary, not the part that touches z.

In case 1, x and z would touch at a boundary without sharing interior points, so EC(x,z).
In case 2, x and z would not touch at all, so DC(x,z).

Given the pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive nature of the RCC-8 relations, x and z can only be in one of these eight relations. From my analysis, the only possible relations are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Ok I think I've been overthinking this. I'll just double check my logic:

We know TPP(x,y), meaning x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is properly contained within y, but x touches the boundary of y at at least one point.

We also know EC(y,z), meaning y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Given these, what are the possible relations between x and z?

Since x is inside y (due to TPP(x,y)) and z is outside y (due to EC(y,z)), there's no way x can be inside z or vice versa. This rules out TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Similarly, since x is inside y and z is outside y, they cannot share interior points. This rules out PO(x,z).

The only question is whether x and z can touch. Since x touches y's boundary and z also touches y's boundary, there are two possibilities:
1. x and z touch the same part of y's boundary. In this case, x and z would touch, making EC(x,z) valid.
2. x and z touch different parts of y's boundary. In this case, x and z would not touch, making DC(x,z) valid.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Therefore, the answer is DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I think this is correct.

Actually, wait. In the context of RCC-8, "touching the boundary" might mean different things. TPP(x,y) means x is inside y and "touches" y's boundary. EC(y,z) means y and z "touch" at a boundary. But do these "touches" have the same definition?

Normally:
- TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is properly contained in y and its boundary touches the boundary of y.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. This means the boundaries of y and z touch, but their interiors don't overlap.

Given these, if TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), then x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary. The question is: can x also touch z's boundary?

It depends on the specific configuration, but there are scenarios where x and z don't touch (DC(x,z)) and scenarios where they do touch (EC(x,z)).

So, my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

OK, I've confirmed my final answer. When we have TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z based on the given conditions.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points)

Let me analyze the possible relations between x and z:

Since x is inside y (from TPP(x,y)) and z is outside y (from EC(y,z)):
- x cannot be part of z, so TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible
- z cannot be part of x, so TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are impossible
- x and z cannot be equal, so EQ(x,z) is impossible
- x and z cannot partially overlap, so PO(x,z) is impossible

The only possibilities are:
1. DC(x,z): If x touches y's boundary at a location different from where y touches z
2. EC(x,z): If x touches y's boundary exactly where y touches z

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
