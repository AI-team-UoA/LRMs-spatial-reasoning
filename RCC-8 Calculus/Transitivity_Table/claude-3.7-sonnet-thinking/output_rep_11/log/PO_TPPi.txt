PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step. We have two given relations:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Given that PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some spatial part, but neither is contained entirely within the other.

Given that TPP(z,y), we know that z is entirely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected?
   Yes, this is possible. Since x partially overlaps with y, part of x is outside y. And since z is entirely within y, it's possible that z doesn't overlap with the part of x that's inside y. In this case, x and z would be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts?
   Yes, this is possible. Since z touches y's boundary and x can also intersect with y's boundary (due to partial overlap), it's possible that x and z touch at a common boundary point but don't share interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap?
   Yes, this is possible. Since x partially overlaps with y and z is inside y, it's possible that the part of x inside y overlaps with z, but neither contains the other entirely.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. But since x partially overlaps with y, part of x is outside y. Since z is entirely inside y, it's not possible for x to be entirely inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Similar to the above, this would require x to be entirely inside z, which is not possible given the conditions. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that z is inside y and x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that the part of x that's inside y entirely contains z. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given the conditions, this is possible if the part of x inside y completely encompasses z without z touching the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are coincident?
   This would mean x and z are the same region. But since x partially overlaps with y and z is entirely inside y, they can't be the same. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double check this by visualizing these spatial relationships.

PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap. Here's a simple visualization:
```
   +------+
   |      |
+--+------+--+
|  |      |  |
|  |      |  |
+--+------+--+
   |      |
   +------+
   
   x: the left rectangle
   y: the right rectangle
```

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. Here's a visualization:
```
   +------+
   |      |
   |  +---+
   |  |   |
   |  +---+
   |      |
   +------+
   
   y: the outer rectangle
   z: the inner rectangle that touches y's boundary
```

Combining these, we have:
```
   +------+
   |      |
+--+------+--+
|  |  +---+  |
|  |  |   |  |
+--+--+---+--+
   |      |
   +------+
   
   x: the left rectangle
   y: the right rectangle
   z: the small rectangle inside y that touches y's boundary
```

Now, let's re-examine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x, then x and z are disconnected. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z): If z touches the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y, then x and z can touch at a boundary. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): If z partially overlaps with the overlapping region between x and y, then x and z can partially overlap. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be entirely inside z. But since part of x is outside y and z is entirely inside y, this is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be entirely inside z, which is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary. This is possible if the overlapping region between x and y entirely contains z and z touches the boundary of this region.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be entirely inside x and not touch x's boundary. This is possible if the overlapping region entirely contains z and z doesn't touch the boundary of this region.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be coincident, they would need to be the same region. Given that x partially overlaps with y and z is entirely inside y, they can't be the same.

So, the possible relationships are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But actually, let me think about this more carefully. I'm not sure that the NTPP(z, x) case is possible.

We have PO(x, y) and TPP(z, y). TPP(z, y) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. 

Let's think about the definition of NTPP(z, x). It means that z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. But we also know that z touches the boundary of y (from TPP(z, y)). 

Given that z touches the boundary of y, for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, it would mean that the boundary of y that z touches is entirely inside x. But this contradicts the PO(x, y) relation, which means x and y share a part but neither is a part of the other.

If a point on the boundary of y is inside x, then that point is not on the boundary of the overlapping region of x and y, which means x extends beyond y at that point. But this doesn't align with the PO(x, y) relation where neither is part of the other.

Let me clarify: for NTPPi(x, z) to hold, z must be inside x and not touch the boundary of x. Given TPP(z, y), z touches the boundary of y. For z to not touch the boundary of x while touching the boundary of y, the boundary of y that z touches must be inside x. But this suggests that x extends beyond y at that point, which contradicts PO(x, y) where neither is part of the other.

Actually let me rethink this... Maybe I'm overthinking the NTPPi(x, z) case. 

Let's try to visualize this differently:
```
   +------+
   |      |
+--+------+--+
|  |      |  |
|  |  +---+  |
|  |  |   |  |
+--+--+---+--+
   |      |
   +------+
   
   x: the left rectangle
   y: the right rectangle
   z: the small rectangle inside both x and y that touches y's boundary but not x's boundary
```

In this visualization, z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, which is NTPPi(x, z). But z does touch the boundary of y, which aligns with TPP(z, y).

So I think NTPPi(x, z) is possible.

Let me verify the other cases once more:

1. DC(x, z): If z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x, then x and z are disconnected.
   Example visualization:
   ```
   +------+
   |      |
+--+------+--+
|  |      |  |
|  |   +--+  |
|  |   |  |  |
+--+---+--+--+
   |      |
   +------+
   
   x: the left rectangle
   y: the right rectangle
   z: the small rectangle inside y but not overlapping with x
   ```

2. EC(x, z): If z touches the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y, then x and z can touch at a boundary.
   Example visualization:
   ```
   +------+
   |      |
+--+------+--+
|  |   +--+  |
|  |   |  |  |
+--+---+--+--+
   |      |
   +------+
   
   x: the left rectangle
   y: the right rectangle
   z: the small rectangle inside y that touches the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y
   ```

3. PO(x, z): If z partially overlaps with the overlapping region between x and y, then x and z can partially overlap.
   Example visualization:
   ```
   +------+
   |      |
+--+------+--+
|  |   +--+  |
|  +---+  |  |
+--+---+--+--+
   |      |
   +------+
   
   x: the left rectangle
   y: the right rectangle
   z: the small rectangle that partially overlaps with x inside y
   ```

4. TPPi(x, z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary.
   Example visualization:
   ```
   +------+
   |      |
+--+------+--+
|  |      |  |
|  +---+  |  |
|  |   |  |  |
+--+---+--+--+
   |      |
   +------+
   
   x: the left rectangle
   y: the right rectangle
   z: the small rectangle inside both x and y that touches the boundary of x
   ```

5. NTPPi(x, z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be entirely inside x and not touch x's boundary.
   Example visualization:
   ```
   +------+
   |      |
+--+------+--+
|  |      |  |
|  |  +---+  |
|  |  |   |  |
+--+--+---+--+
   |      |
   +------+
   
   x: the left rectangle
   y: the right rectangle
   z: the small rectangle inside both x and y that doesn't touch the boundary of x
   ```

Given the visual confirmations, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z) are:
- DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x, z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me verify this with the composition table for RCC-8.

The RCC-8 composition table for PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z) states that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)
- PO(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

So, my analysis aligns with the established composition table for RCC-8.

To be completely sure, let's check the definitions once more:

1. DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x, z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x, z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary.
5. NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

And the given:
- PO(x, y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y, z): z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is entirely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given the above, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)
- PO(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

I've double-checked this and I'm confident in the answer.

Actually, now I'm remembering that we originally had TPPi(y, z) and not TPP(z, y). I think I interpreted TPPi(y, z) incorrectly earlier.

TPPi(y, z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, or equivalently, TPP(y, z). This means y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider the spatial relationships:

Given:
- PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y, z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's visualize:
```
     +----------+
     |          |
     |  +------+|
     |  |      ||
+----+--+------+|
|    |  |       |
|    +--+       |
|                |
+----------------+

x: the bottom rectangle
y: the small rectangle in the middle
z: the large rectangle surrounding y
```

Now, let's re-examine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): Can x and z be disconnected? If x and y overlap, and y is entirely inside z, then x and z must share at least the part where x and y overlap. So, DC(x, z) is not possible.

2. EC(x, z): Can x and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts? Given the overlap between x and y, and the fact that y is inside z, x and z must share some interior parts. So, EC(x, z) is not possible.

3. PO(x, z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if part of x is outside z and part of x overlaps with y (which is inside z). This is possible.

4. TPP(x, z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z and touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x, z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is deep inside z.

6. TPPi(x, z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside z and overlaps with x, it's not possible for z to be entirely inside x. So, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Similarly to the above, z can't be entirely inside x. So, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): Can x and z be coincident? Since x overlaps with y and y is a proper part of z, it's possible that x and z are the same region. However, if y is a proper part of z, it implies that z has parts that y doesn't. If x and y partially overlap, it's unlikely that x and z would be the same. So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

But let me double check this. TPP(y, z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. PO(x, y) means x and y partially overlap. Could x and z be equal?

If x and z are equal, then y would be a tangential proper part of x. This contradicts the PO(x, y) relation, which means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z) are:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)

Let's double check this with the composition table for RCC-8. The composition of PO(x, y) and TPP(y, z) should give the possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, let's be more careful here. TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given:
- PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y, z): This is the inverse of TPP, which means TPP(z, y). So, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Visualizing:
```
   +------+
   |      |
+--+------+--+
|  |  +---+  |
|  |  |   |  |
+--+--+---+--+
   |      |
   +------+
   
   x: the left rectangle
   y: the right rectangle
   z: the small rectangle inside y that touches y's boundary
```

Now, let's re-examine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x, z): Can x and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts? Yes, if z touches the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y.

3. PO(x, z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if z overlaps with the overlapping region between x and y.

4. TPP(x, z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Given that x extends beyond y and z is inside y, it's not possible for x to be entirely inside z. So, TPP(x, z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x, z): Similarly, x can't be entirely inside z. So, NTPP(x, z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x, z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if the overlapping region between x and y entirely contains z and z touches the boundary of this region.

7. NTPPi(x, z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if the overlapping region entirely contains z and z doesn't touch the boundary of this region.

8. EQ(x, z): Can x and z be coincident? Given that x partially overlaps with y and z is inside y, they can't be the same. So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z) are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)
- PO(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

This aligns with my previous analysis. Let's check it with the RCC-8 composition table.

According to the RCC-8 composition table:
For PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)
- PO(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

Which aligns with our analysis.

In summary, given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
DC(x, z), EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPPi(x, z), and NTPPi(x, z).

Now let me double-check this by generating explicit scenarios for each of the possible relations.

1. DC(x, z):
```
    y
+-------+
|       |
|   z   |   x
|  +-+  | +---+
|  | |  | |   |
|  +-+  | |   |
|       | |   |
+-------+ +---+
```
In this scenario, y and x are partially overlapping (so PO(x, y) holds), and z is a tangential proper part of y but entirely separate from x. This means DC(x, z) holds.

2. EC(x, z):
```
    y
+-------+
|       |
|   z   |
|  +-+  |
|  | |  |
|  +-+  |
|       |
+---+---+
    |
  +-+-+
  |   |
  |   |
  |   |
  +---+
    x
```
In this scenario, y and x share a region (PO(x, y)), and z is a tangential proper part of y. The boundary of z touches the boundary of x exactly at the boundary of y, making x and z externally connected (EC(x, z)).

3. PO(x, z):
```
    y
+-------+
|       |
|   z   |
|  +---+|
|  |////|
|  +/---+
|   /   |
+---+---+
    |
  +-+-+
  |///|
  |///|
  |   |
  +---+
    x
```
In this scenario, y and x share a region (PO(x, y)), and z is a tangential proper part of y. The region z partially overlaps with x (denoted by ////), making PO(x, z) true.

4. TPPi(x, z):
```
      y
  +-------+
  |       |
  |   z   |
  |  +---++-----+
  |  |    ||     |
  |  |    ||     |
  |  +----++     |
  |        |     |
  +--------+     |
               x |
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 +
```
In this scenario, y and x share a region (PO(x, y)), and z is a tangential proper part of y. The region z is also a tangential proper part of x, meaning that z is contained in x and touches the boundary of x, making TPPi(x, z) true.

5. NTPPi(x, z):
```
       y
   +-------+
   |       |
   |   z   |
   |  +--+ |
   |  |  | |  x
   |  |  | | +-----+
   |  +--+ | |     |
   |       | |     |
   +-------+ |     |
              |     |
              |     |
              |     |
              +-----+
```
In this scenario, y and x share a region (PO(x, y)), and z is a tangential proper part of y. The region z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x, z) true.

Based on these visualizations, it's clear that all five spatial relationships (DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi) are possible between x and z given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z).

But wait, I see a problem with my visualization for the TPPi(x, z) case. Let me reexamine.

4. TPPi(x, z):
```
      y
  +-------+
  |       |
  |   z   |
  |  +---++-----+
  |  |////||     |
  |  |////||     |
  |  +----++     |
  |        |     |
  +--------+     |
               x |
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 +
```
In this scenario, the region z is not a tangential proper part of x. Instead, x is partially overlapping with z. The correct visualization for TPPi(x, z) would be:

```
      y
  +-------+
  |       |
  |   z   |
  |  +---+|
  |  |   ||
  |  |   ||
  |  |   ||
  |  |   ||
  |  |   ||
  |  +---+|
  |       |
  +-------+
     |   |
     |   |
  +--+---+----+
  |  |   |    |
  |  +---+    |
  |           |
  |         x |
  +-----------+
```

Now, in this scenario, z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x. This makes TPPi(x, z) true.

But hold on, I'm still not sure this is right. Let's reexamine the definitions and the relationship again:

- PO(x, y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y, z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

So y is contained in z and touches the boundary of z. If x partially overlaps with y, and y is contained in z, then x can have various relationships with z.

Specifically, could TPPi(x, z) be true? That would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, it's challenging to visualize how z could be contained within x. Let me think about this case more carefully.

If TPPi(x, z) is true, then TPP(z, x) is true. This means z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y is a tangential proper part of z, y is contained within z. And given that x partially overlaps with y, part of x is outside y. It's hard to reconcile these constraints.

Actually, let's look at the relationship slightly differently:

- PO(x, y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPPi(y, z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

If TPPi(x, z) is true, then z is a tangential proper part of x. That is, z is contained within x and touches the boundary of x. But TPPi(y, z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. Given the nesting, y is also contained within x. 

For PO(x, y) to hold, x and y must share a spatial part, and neither can be a part of the other. If y is a tangential proper part of z, and z is a tangential proper part of x, then y is also a proper part of x. But this contradicts the PO(x, y) relation. Therefore, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x, z) would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This also implies y is a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x, y).

Let me revisit the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected? If x and y overlap, and y is inside z, then x and z must share at least the part where x and y overlap. So, DC(x, z) is not possible.

2. EC(x, z): Is it possible that x and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts? Given the overlap between x and y, and the fact that y is inside z, x and z must share some interior parts. So, EC(x, z) is not possible.

3. PO(x, z): Is it possible that x and z partially overlap? Yes, if part of x is outside z and part of x overlaps with y (which is inside z). This is possible.

4. TPP(x, z): Is it possible that x is a tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z and touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x, z): Is it possible that x is a non-tangential proper part of z? Yes, if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is deep inside z.

6. TPPi(x, z): Is it possible that z is a tangential proper part of x? Given the relationship between y and z, this would mean y is also a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x, y). So, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): Is it possible that z is a non-tangential proper part of x? Similarly to the above, this would mean y is a proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x, y). So, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): Is it possible that x and z are coincident? If y is a proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, then x and z can't be the same. So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

In summary, given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)

Let's consult the RCC-8 composition table.

For PO(x, y) o TPPi(y, z), the possible relationships between x and z according to the RCC-8 composition table should be:
- PO(x, z)
- TPP(x, z)
- NTPP(x, z)

Ok, now I see the problem. I've been shifting the interpretation of TPPi(y, z). 

TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. But in the above interpretation, I incorrectly interpreted it as TPP(y, z).

Let's stick with the correct interpretation: TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), so z is a tangential proper part of y, not the other way around. This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given:
- PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPPi(y, z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

   y: the right rectangle
   z: the small rectangle inside y that touches y's boundary
```

Now, let's re-examine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, if z is in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x, z): Can x and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts? Yes, if z touches the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y.

3. PO(x, z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if z overlaps with the overlapping region between x and y.

4. TPP(x, z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? Given that x extends beyond y and z is inside y, it's not possible for x to be entirely inside z. So, TPP(x, z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x, z): Similarly, x can't be entirely inside z. So, NTPP(x, z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x, z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if the overlapping region between x and y entirely contains z and z touches the boundary of this region.

7. NTPPi(x, z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if the overlapping region entirely contains z and z doesn't touch the boundary of this region.

8. EQ(x, z): Can x and z be coincident? Given that x partially overlaps with y and z is inside y, they can't be the same. So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

In summary, given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x, z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let's check it with the RCC-8 composition table. For PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), the possible relationships between x and z according to the RCC-8 composition table are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)
- PO(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

Ah, I see the problem. I was initially working with the right interpretation, but then I got confused when double-checking. Let's settle on the correct answer now:

Given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), which means TPP(z, y) or "z is a tangential proper part of y", the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x, z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

I just realized that I'm getting confused with my own use of TPPi(y, z). Let's be absolutely clear:

- TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), which means "z is a tangential proper part of y."
- TPP(a, b) means "a is a tangential proper part of b."

So, TPPi(y, z) means "z is a tangential proper part of y." This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given the clarity on TPPi(y, z), the possible relationships between x and z given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z) are:
- DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x, z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Actually let's double-check the answer.

Given PO(x, y) and TPPi(y, z), which means TPP(z, y) (z is a tangential proper part of y), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x, z)
- EC(x, z)
- PO(x, z)
- TPPi(x, z)
- NTPPi(x, z)

I believe that's the definitive answer based on the definitions and the RCC-8 composition table.

Actually, I think I introduced confusion above by toggling back and forth between direct interpretation (y is a TPP of z) and the inverse interpretation (z is a TPP of y). Let's eliminate the mention of the TPPi notation and just say:

Given PO(x, y) and the fact that z is a tangential proper part of y, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x, z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x, z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- PO(x, z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPPi(x, z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x, z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

In summary: DC(x, z), EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPPi(x, z), NTPPi(x, z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z given the two constraints.

Given information:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some spatial part, but neither is contained in the other)
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (which means z is properly contained in y and touches y's boundary)

Since z is properly contained in y (and touches y's boundary), and x partially overlaps with y, the possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if z is located in a part of y that doesn't overlap with x.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z touches the boundary of the overlapping region between x and y.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if z partially overlaps with the region where x and y intersect.

4. TPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

The relations TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because x extends beyond y while z is contained in y.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
