PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm given that NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). Let's understand what these mean:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x). This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). This means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. So z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

So we have z completely inside y, and y completely inside x. 

Let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z.

We know that z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x. This means z is also completely inside x. And since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z certainly doesn't touch x's boundary. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x).

In the given notation, this would be NTPPi(z,x).

Wait, I need to be careful. The relation is between x and z, not z and x. So the relation is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

To double-check: NTPPi(x,z) means NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. That makes sense given our setup.

So the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, let me try to visualize this to make sure I haven't made a mistake.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Given these two, z is inside y which is inside x. So z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

But actually, I want to double-check that this is the only possible relationship. 

Let's review all the possible RCC-8 relations:
1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
3. PO(x,z) - x and z share a part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,z) - x is a part of z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are coincident (the same).

We need to determine which of these is compatible with the given information.

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know z is inside y and y is inside x, so z is also inside x. Thus, x and z are connected, and DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. But we know z is completely inside y, which is completely inside x. So z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Thus, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share a part, but neither is part of the other. But we know z is completely inside y, which is completely inside x. So z is completely inside x, meaning z is a part of x. Thus, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a part of z and touches z's boundary. But we know z is completely inside y, which is completely inside x. So it's z that is a part of x, not the other way around. Thus, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to 4, we know it's z that is a part of x, not the other way around. Thus, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a part of x and touches x's boundary. We know z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So z, being inside y, also cannot touch x's boundary. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. We know z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So z, being inside y, also cannot touch x's boundary. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same. But we know z is inside y, which is inside x. So x and z are different. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning, because I want to make sure I've considered all potential options.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x, away from x's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.

These together imply that z is completely inside x, away from x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z).

I think that's the only possible relationship between x and z given the information.

Wait, let's actually double-check a bit more. I'm thinking about the fact that the regions can have different shapes. We know that z is completely inside y, and y is completely inside x. Could there be any other relationship between z and x?

Actually, with the given relations, NTPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), there is only one possible relationship between x and z, which is NTPPi(x,z).

So to be sure, the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

One more double-check: I realize I've been making an implicit assumption that the regions are in 2D. But even in higher dimensions, the logic would hold. If z is completely inside y and away from y's boundary, and y is completely inside x and away from x's boundary, then z is completely inside x and away from x's boundary.

So I believe the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, after further reflection, I'm realizing there might be some subtleties. Let's be even more careful:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x) which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x, away from x's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y) which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y, away from y's boundary.

Given these, z is inside y and y is inside x. This means z is inside x. Furthermore, z is away from y's boundary, and y is away from x's boundary. This ensures that z is away from x's boundary. So z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x), or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So I maintain that the answer is: NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how x and z relate given the information about their relationships with y.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Analyzing the spatial arrangement:
- z is completely contained within y (away from y's boundary)
- y is completely contained within x (away from x's boundary)

This means z must be completely contained within x, and since z doesn't touch y's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is expressed as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
