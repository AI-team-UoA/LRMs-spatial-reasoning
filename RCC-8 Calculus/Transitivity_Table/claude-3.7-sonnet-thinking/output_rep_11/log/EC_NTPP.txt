PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. 

We're given that:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's analyze what EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) tell us:
- EC(x,y): x touches y only at their boundaries.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary.

Given that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x only touches y at their boundaries, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected and don't share any parts.
   Is this possible? No, because x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, so x must have some relationship with z.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
   Is this possible? Yes, if x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z but not touching z's boundary, then x could be touching z at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts.
   Is this possible? Yes, x could overlap with z, especially if part of x extends into z beyond its touch point with y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary.
   Is this possible? Yes, x could be completely inside z but touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   Is this possible? I'm not sure about this. If x is touching y, and y is completely inside z not touching z's boundary, it seems like x might touch z's boundary or not be inside z at all.

   Actually, it could be possible if x is very small and only touches y, and both x and y are inside z away from its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary.
   Is this possible? If z is bigger than y, and y is inside z, it seems unlikely that z would be inside x. So, I don't think this is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
   Is this possible? For similar reasons as TPPi, this doesn't seem possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident.
   Is this possible? If x and y are touching at their boundaries, and y is inside z, it's unlikely that x and z would be identical. So, I don't think this is possible.

Wait, I need to reconsider some of my reasoning. Let me think more carefully about the implications of EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. This means there's at least one point p that is both on the boundary of x and on the boundary of y, and there's no point that's in the interior of both x and y.

NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This means every point of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z.

Given these, if there's a point p that's on the boundary of both x and y, and every point of y (including its boundary) is in the interior of z, then p is both on the boundary of x and in the interior of z.

Now, let's reassess the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This would mean x and z don't share any points. But we know p is both on the boundary of x and in the interior of z, so they do share at least one point. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. This would mean there's a point q that's on both the boundary of x and the boundary of z, and no point is in the interior of both. But we've established that p is on the boundary of x and in the interior of z. This contradiction means EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts, but neither is completely inside the other. Given that there's a point p on the boundary of x that's in the interior of z, if there are points of x outside of z, then PO(x,z) would be the relationship. This is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, touching z's boundary. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given our constraints, is this possible? 

   If x is completely inside z and there's a point p on the boundary of x that's in the interior of z, then all of x must be in the interior of z, which means x doesn't touch z's boundary. This contradiction means TPP(x,z) is not possible.

   Wait, I need to be more careful. TPP(x,z) means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. So, part of the boundary of x coincides with part of the boundary of z, and the rest of x is inside z. Given that every point of y (including its boundary) is in the interior of z, and x touches y at their boundaries, it means that the point where x touches y is in the interior of z. But this doesn't preclude x from also touching z's boundary at another point. So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given our constraints, is this possible?

   If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and there's a point p on the boundary of x that's in the interior of z, then all of x must be in the interior of z. This is consistent with our constraints. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary. This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y at their boundaries. This would place y inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to the reasoning for TPPi, this would place y inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same, and y is completely inside z, then y would be completely inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I think I might be making errors in my reasoning. Let me reconsider and use a more visual approach. 

If we have EC(x,y), it means x and y share boundary points but no interior points.
If we have NTPP(y,z), it means y is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, for each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: If x is disconnected from z, and y is inside z, then x would be disconnected from y, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I should start with a cleaner conceptualization. 

Let's visualize this:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap in their interiors.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, and no part of y touches the boundary of z.

Given these, what can be the relationship between x and z?

Since x touches y at their boundaries, and y is completely inside z, x must interact with z in some way. Because y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, the point where x touches y is strictly inside z.

Now, let's consider the rest of x:
- If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z).
- If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z).
- If x partially extends outside z, then PO(x,z).

I think these are the only possible relationships. Let me double-check the other possibilities:

- DC(x,z): Not possible because x touches y, which is inside z.
- EC(x,z): Not possible because the point where x touches y is strictly inside z, so x and z share interior points.
- TPPi(x,z): Not possible because z contains y, which is EC to x, so z cannot be inside x.
- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPPi.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because if x equals z, and y is strictly inside z, then y would be strictly inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think my reasoning around TPP(x,z) might be flawed. Let me reconsider.

TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x touches y at their boundaries, and y is strictly inside z away from its boundary, then the touch point between x and y must be inside z and away from z's boundary. This doesn't preclude other parts of x from touching z's boundary, so TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me double check my conclusions using the definitions of the relations:

- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This can happen if part of x extends outside of z while still touching y.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This can happen if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, while still touching y somewhere else.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This can happen if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, while still touching y.

Yes, these are the three possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, let me try once more with a clearer approach. I want to make sure I'm not making any errors in my reasoning.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

If y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then any point on the boundary of y is in the interior of z. Since x touches y at their boundaries, the touch point is on the boundary of both x and y. This means the touch point is on the boundary of x and in the interior of z. This touch point alone doesn't determine the entire relationship between x and z; we need to consider the rest of x.

For each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This would mean x and z don't share any points. But we've established that there's a point on the boundary of x that's in the interior of z, so they do share points. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This would mean the only shared points between x and z are boundary points. But we've established that there's a point on the boundary of x that's in the interior of z, which contradicts the definition of EC. Thus, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap, meaning they share some interior points but neither is a subset of the other. If x extends outside of z, then PO(x,z) is a possible relationship. Given our constraints, this can happen.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given our constraints, this can happen if the rest of x (apart from the touch point with y) is inside z, and some part of x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given our constraints, this can happen if the rest of x (apart from the touch point with y) is inside z and away from z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know y is inside z, so if z were inside x, then y would also be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Similarly to TPPi, this would imply y is inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same. If this were the case, then y would be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y). Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I realize I'm probably overthinking this, so let me try to visualize the scenarios and reason through them more intuitively:

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at their boundaries.
Given NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Scenario 1: x extends outside of z.
If x touches y at their boundaries, and y is inside z, and x extends outside of z, then x and z partially overlap. This gives us PO(x,z).

Scenario 2: x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.
If x touches y at their boundaries, and y is inside z, and x is also inside z but touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z. This gives us TPP(x,z).

Scenario 3: x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
If x touches y at their boundaries, and y is inside z, and x is also inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This gives us NTPP(x,z).

Based on these scenarios, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, but actually I'm a bit unsure about TPP(x,z). Let me think again...

TPP(x,z) means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is strictly inside z, the touch point is inside z. For TPP(x,z) to be true, some other part of x (not the touch point with y) must touch z's boundary. This is geometrically possible.

Let me double check once more:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't overlap in their interiors.
NTPP(y,z): y is strictly inside z, away from z's boundary.

Given these, the point where x touches y is inside z and away from z's boundary. Based on the rest of x:

1. If x extends outside of z, we have PO(x,z).
2. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary (at a point other than where it touches y), we have TPP(x,z).
3. If x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, we have NTPP(x,z).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I've reasoned through this several times now and have consistently reached the same conclusion, so I'm confident that these are the correct possible relationships.

Final answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given the constraints:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points
2. NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Since x touches y at their boundaries, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, the point where x touches y must be inside z's interior. From this point, there are three possible configurations for x:

1. PO(x,z): If x partially extends outside of z while touching y, then x and z partially overlap.

2. TPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z but some part of x (away from where it touches y) touches z's boundary, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

3. NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary anywhere, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Other relationships are impossible because:
- DC(x,z) is impossible since x must interact with z through y
- EC(x,z) is impossible since x must share interior points with z
- TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ are impossible since they would require y to be inside x, contradicting EC(x,y)

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
