PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this carefully. We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): x contains y as a non-tangential proper part. This means y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y contains z as a tangential proper part. This means z is properly inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, we need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

Since y is properly inside x (without touching x's boundary), and z is properly inside y (touching y's boundary), we know that z is inside x. But we need to determine whether z touches x's boundary or not.

Given that z touches y's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, can z touch x's boundary? 

No, z cannot touch x's boundary. Since y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and z is inside y, there's a "buffer" of y between z and x's boundary. So z cannot reach x's boundary.

Therefore, z is properly inside x without touching x's boundary. This means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Let's double-check this reasoning:

NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means z is properly inside y and touches y's boundary.

Wait, let me be more careful here. TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is properly inside z and touches z's boundary. So y is inside z, not the other way around.

Let's start over and be more precise with the definitions:

- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is properly inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, we have y properly inside x without touching x's boundary, and y properly inside z touching z's boundary.

So both x and z contain y. Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But both x and z contain y, so they must overlap. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But since both contain y, they must overlap. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is possible if some parts of x are outside z and some parts of z are outside x, while they both contain y.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. This is possible if x and z occupy exactly the same space.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Wait, let me think more carefully about this. I think I'm missing some constraints.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means y is properly inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these constraints, let's think about what we know:
- y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- y is properly inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. But since both contain y, they must overlap. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But since both contain y, they must overlap. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. y is inside the overlapping region, and there are parts of x outside z and parts of z outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and also touches z's boundary, it's possible for x to also touch z's boundary. So TPP is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know y is inside z and doesn't touch x's boundary. If z touches x's boundary, y cannot be a non-tangential proper part of x. So TPPi is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Given that y is inside z and doesn't touch x's boundary, z could be completely inside x without touching its boundary. So NTPPi is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. If x and z occupy exactly the same space, then y would be inside both and would either touch both of their boundaries or none. But we know y touches z's boundary but not x's. So EQ is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm still not sure if I've got this right. Let's think about it in a different way.

NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x without touching x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

We can draw this scenario and see what's possible for the relationship between x and z.

Given these constraints, here are the possible scenarios:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. y is in the overlapping region, and there are parts of x outside z and parts of z outside x.

2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and also touches z's boundary, it's possible for x to also touch z's boundary. So TPP is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible.

4. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. But if z is completely inside x and y touches z's boundary, then y would be inside x but not inside z's interior. This contradicts our given TPPi(y,z), which says y is inside z. So NTPPi is not possible.

Actually, I think I've been making a logical error. Let me rethink the TPPi relation.

TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly inside y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): z is properly inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must be inside x. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must be inside x. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z is completely inside x. So PO is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, x cannot be inside z. So TPP is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, x cannot be inside z. So NTPP is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that z touches y's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, it's not possible for z to touch x's boundary. So TPPi is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that z is inside y and y is inside x without touching x's boundary, z is also inside x without touching its boundary. So NTPPi is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z cannot be equal to x. So EQ is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm not sure if I got the logic right when I said TPPi is not possible. Let me reconsider.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is properly inside x and touches x's boundary.

Given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we know:
- y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- z is properly inside y and touches y's boundary.

If z touches y's boundary but y doesn't touch x's boundary, can z touch x's boundary? I think not, because there's a "buffer" of y between z and x's boundary. So TPPi is indeed not possible.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I should have been more careful with the original definitions. Let me restate:

- NTPPi(x,y) means x contains y as a non-tangential proper part. In other words, y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means y contains z as a tangential proper part. In other words, z is properly inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these definitions, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must also be inside x. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must be properly inside x and cannot touch x's boundary. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must be completely inside x. So PO is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, it's not possible for x to be inside z. So TPP is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, it's not possible for x to be inside z. So NTPP is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that z touches y's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, it's not possible for z to touch x's boundary. So TPPi is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that z is inside y and y is inside x without touching x's boundary, z is also inside x without touching its boundary. So NTPPi is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z cannot be equal to x. So EQ is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm not sure if I'm interpreting TPPi correctly. Let me double-check.

In RCC-8, TPPi(a,b) means a contains b as a tangential proper part. It's the inverse of TPP(b,a), which means b is a tangential proper part of a. In TPP(b,a), b is inside a and touches a's boundary. So in TPPi(a,b), b is inside a and touches a's boundary.

Given this interpretation, TPPi(y,z) means y contains z as a tangential proper part. In other words, z is properly inside y and touches y's boundary.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,y) means x contains y as a non-tangential proper part. That is, y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary.

So, we have:
- y is properly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- z is properly inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these constraints, z is inside y and y is inside x. So z is inside x. But does z touch x's boundary? Since z touches y's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, there's a "buffer" of y between z and x's boundary. So z cannot touch x's boundary. Therefore, z is properly inside x without touching its boundary, which means NTPPi(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) is NTPPi(x,z).

I think I've been quite thorough in my analysis, but let me double-check once more by thinking about a concrete example to make sure.

Imagine three concentric circles:
- The outer circle is x.
- The middle circle is y.
- The inner circle is z.

The middle circle (y) doesn't touch the boundary of the outer circle (x), satisfying NTPPi(x,y).
The inner circle (z) touches the boundary of the middle circle (y), satisfying TPPi(y,z).

In this scenario, the inner circle (z) is inside the outer circle (x) without touching its boundary, which corresponds to NTPPi(x,z).

This concrete example confirms our conclusion: given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think there's another possible relationship I haven't fully considered. Let's think about a different example.

Imagine:
- x is a large circle.
- y is a small circle completely inside x without touching its boundary.
- z is a small circle inside y and touching y's boundary.

In this scenario:
- NTPPi(x,y) is satisfied because y is inside x without touching its boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) is satisfied because z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z) is satisfied because z is inside x without touching its boundary.

But what if z is not a small circle but a more complex shape? For instance, imagine z is a complex shape that extends almost to the boundary of y in multiple places. It's still completely inside y and touches y's boundary, but it covers a larger portion of y. In such a case, z could still be inside x without touching its boundary, satisfying NTPPi(x,z).

So, I think the only possible relationship between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) is indeed NTPPi(x,z).

Wait actually, let me reconsider just to make sure I've truly covered all possible relationships in the RCC-8 calculus.

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must also be inside x. So DC is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must be properly inside x and cannot touch x's boundary. So EC is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must be completely inside x. So PO is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, it's not possible for x to be inside z. So TPP is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, it's not possible for x to be inside z. So NTPP is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that z touches y's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, it's not possible for z to touch x's boundary. So TPPi is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Given that z is inside y and y is inside x without touching x's boundary, z is also inside x without touching its boundary. So NTPPi is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident. But since z is inside y and y is inside x, z cannot be equal to x. So EQ is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) is NTPPi(x,z).

So the answer is: NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationship can exist between x and z given the conditions NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me understand what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these conditions, I can make the following deductions:
- y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary
- z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary
- Therefore, z must be completely inside x (since z is in y and y is in x)
- Since y doesn't touch x's boundary and z only touches y's boundary, z cannot touch x's boundary

This means z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which corresponds to the NTPPi(x,z) relation.

I can verify this is the only possible relation by checking each RCC-8 relation:
- DC, EC: Not possible because z is inside x
- PO: Not possible because z is completely inside x
- TPP, NTPP: Not possible because x cannot be inside z
- TPPi: Not possible because z cannot touch x's boundary
- EQ: Not possible because z is properly inside x
- NTPPi: Possible because z is inside x without touching its boundary

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
