PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through the relationships systematically.

We know that:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and touches y's boundary.

So we have a situation where z is contained within y, and y is contained within x. The question is: what relationship does z have with x?

Let me go through the possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This can't be true because z is contained within y, which is contained within x. So z must be connected to x.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior. This can't be true because z is within y, which is within x, so z must be inside x.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior, but neither is wholly contained in the other. This can't be true because z is wholly contained in y, which is wholly contained in x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This can't be true because we know y is a proper part of x, and z is a proper part of y, so z cannot contain x.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This can't be true for the same reason as #4.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z touches the boundary of x while being inside x. Given that z is a tangential proper part of y, and y is a tangential proper part of x, it's possible for z to touch the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is also possible if z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Even though z touches y's boundary, that doesn't mean it touches x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. This can't be true because z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, so z cannot be equal to x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me double-check this. We know that z touches the boundary of y. And we know that y touches the boundary of x. But does this mean z necessarily touches the boundary of x? Not necessarily. Z could touch a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x, not on the boundary of x.

Let me visualize this:

Case 1: z touches y's boundary at a point that is also on x's boundary. In this case, z touches the boundary of x, so TPPi(x,z) holds.

Case 2: z touches y's boundary at a point that is in the interior of x. In this case, z doesn't touch the boundary of x, so NTPPi(x,z) holds.

So my conclusion seems correct: the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to make sure I haven't overlooked anything. Let me think about this again.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
- y is a proper part of x: all of y is inside x, and y does not equal x.
- y is tangential to x: y touches the boundary of x.

TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
- z is a proper part of y: all of z is inside y, and z does not equal y.
- z is tangential to y: z touches the boundary of y.

Now, let's derive the possible relationships between x and z.

First, we know that z is inside y, and y is inside x. So z is definitely inside x. This means z is a proper part of x. Therefore, one of the following must hold:
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

As I explained earlier, both are possible depending on whether z touches the boundary of x or not.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize there's a simpler way to express this. If TPPi(x,y), then TPP(y,x). And if TPPi(y,z), then TPP(z,y). So we're looking at the composition TPP(y,x) * TPP(z,y) and asking what that implies about the relationship between z and x.

In the RCC-8 calculus, the composition TPP * TPP yields either TPP or NTPP. That is, if TPP(z,y) and TPP(y,x), then either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

Translating back to our problem, if TPPi(x,y) (i.e., TPP(y,x)) and TPPi(y,z) (i.e., TPP(z,y)), then either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x). In terms of the inverse relations, this means either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize I'm making a mistake here. When we translate TPP(z,y) and TPP(y,x) to a relation between z and x, we don't get the inverse relation. We get the direct relation: TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x). But the question asks for the relationship between x and z, not z and x. So we need to express these as relations between x and z.

TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x, which is TPPi(x,z) (the inverse relation).
NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPPi(x,z) (the inverse relation).

So, indeed, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me just make sure I've got all this right. We know that TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). This means:
- y is a tangential proper part of x: all of y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- z is a tangential proper part of y: all of z is inside y, and z touches the boundary of y.

So, z is definitely inside x. The question is whether z touches the boundary of x.

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPPi(x,z).

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x (i.e., at a point in the interior of x), then z doesn't touch the boundary of x. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check once more by reasoning about the possible configurations:

1. Z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z touches the boundary of y.
2. Y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning y touches the boundary of x.

Case 1: z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, z also touches the boundary of x.
Case 2: z touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x (i.e., at a point in the interior of x). In this case, z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

In Case 1, z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).
In Case 2, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, but let me reason about this from the original definitions once more just to be sure.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. "Tangential" means y touches the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. "Tangential" means z touches the boundary of y.

Given these relations, we know:
- y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

From these, we can deduce:
- z is inside x (because z is inside y, which is inside x).
- x and z are definitely not disconnected (DC), not externally connected (EC), not partially overlapping (PO), not equal (EQ).
- z is not a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x (because z is smaller than y, which is smaller than x).

So the only possible relations are:
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is fully inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Let's think: Can z touch the boundary of x?

Given that z touches the boundary of y and y touches the boundary of x, z might touch the boundary of x if it touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary. But z might also touch y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch x's boundary. So both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this more deeply. Specifically, let's consider the properties of "touching the boundary":

1. If z touches the boundary of y at a point p, and y touches the boundary of x at the same point p, then z also touches the boundary of x at point p. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPPi(x,z).

2. If z touches the boundary of y at a point p, but y doesn't touch the boundary of x at point p (i.e., point p is in the interior of x), then z doesn't necessarily touch the boundary of x. In this case, z might be a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z).

So, based on the given information, both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z.

I think I'm still a bit uncertain about this. Let me try to construct specific scenarios to make sure I've covered all possibilities.

Scenario 1: Consider three concentric circles, with z inside y inside x, and all circles touching at one point (like a bullseye with all three circles touching at the top). In this case, z touches the boundary of y, which touches the boundary of x, and z also touches the boundary of x. This gives us TPPi(x,z).

Scenario 2: Consider z as a circle touching the boundary of y from the inside, and y as a circle touching the boundary of x from the inside, but at a different point. For example, z touches y at the top, and y touches x at the bottom. In this case, z touches the boundary of y but not the boundary of x. This gives us NTPPi(x,z).

So both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible, depending on the specific configuration.

Let me try one more approach. We know that:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

From these, we know:
- z is inside y, which is inside x. So z is inside x.
- z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x.

But as I've illustrated, z might or might not touch the boundary of x, depending on the specific configuration. If z touches the boundary of x, then TPPi(x,z). If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I might be making a mistake. Let me double-check my reasoning.

Let's say that R(a, b) refers to the relationship between a and b. We know:
- R(x,y) = TPPi, i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x.
- R(y,z) = TPPi, i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y.

We're asked to find R(x,z), the relationship between x and z.

Now, TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), and TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y). So we're looking at the composition TPP(y,x) * TPP(z,y), and asking what that implies about the relationship between x and z.

Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. The composition TPP(y,x) * TPP(z,y) doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between x and z. Instead, it tells us about the relationship between z and x. Let's think about this more carefully.

From TPPi(x,y), we know y is a tangential proper part of x. From TPPi(y,z), we know z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, z is a proper part of y, which is a proper part of x. Hence, z is a proper part of x.

Now, the question is whether z is a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x. This depends on whether z touches the boundary of x.

Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, z might touch the boundary of x if it touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary. But z might also touch y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch x's boundary. So both are possible.

If z touches the boundary of x, then z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., TPP(z,x). In terms of the relationship from x to z, this is TPPi(x,z).

If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x). In terms of the relationship from x to z, this is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I've been unnecessarily complicating this. Let me reason about this one more time.

We have:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

To find the relationship between x and z, let's consider the possible scenarios.

First, we know z is inside x because z is inside y, which is inside x.

Second, we need to determine if z touches the boundary of x. Given that z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, there are two scenarios:

Scenario 1: z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, z also touches the boundary of x. The relationship is TPPi(x,z), meaning z is a tangential proper part of x.

Scenario 2: z touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x (i.e., at a point in the interior of x). In this case, z doesn't touch the boundary of x. The relationship is NTPPi(x,z), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

But now I realize I need to consider more scenarios. Let's think about the exact meaning of TPPi.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means:
1. All of y is inside x.
2. y is not equal to x.
3. y touches the boundary of x.

Similarly, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
1. All of z is inside y.
2. z is not equal to y.
3. z touches the boundary of y.

Given these, we know:
1. All of z is inside y, which is inside x. So all of z is inside x.
2. z is not equal to y, which is not equal to x. So z is not equal to x.
3. z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x.

But point 3 doesn't directly tell us whether z touches the boundary of x. We need to consider the possible configurations:

a. If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. The relationship is TPPi(x,z).
b. If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z doesn't touch the boundary of x. The relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reason about this one more time.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, we have TPP(y,x) and TPP(z,y). We want to know the possible relations between x and z.

In the RCC-8 calculus, the composition table tells us that TPP(z,y) ∘ TPP(y,x) = {TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x)}. This means if z is a tangential proper part of y, and y is a tangential proper part of x, then either:
- z is a tangential proper part of x, or
- z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Translating back to the inverse relations, we get:
- TPPi(x,z), or
- NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think I've been on the right track all along. The composition table for RCC-8 tells us that TPP ∘ TPP = {TPP, NTPP}. This means if TPP(z,y) and TPP(y,x), then either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

But the question asks for the relationship between x and z, not z and x. So we need to express these as relations between x and z.

TPP(z,x) means z is a tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to TPPi(x,z) (the inverse relation).
NTPP(z,x) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to NTPPi(x,z) (the inverse relation).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

I think I can stop here. The possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me be even more explicit:

TPPi(x,z) means "z is a tangential proper part of x", which occurs when z touches the boundary of x.
NTPPi(x,z) means "z is a non-tangential proper part of x", which occurs when z is fully inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, given that TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

The first relationship, TPPi(x,z), occurs when z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x. The second relationship, NTPPi(x,z), occurs when z touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Let me double check once more that these are the only two possibilities. We know that:

- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

From these, we know:
- z is inside y, which is inside x. So z is inside x.
- z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x.

Given that z is inside y and y is inside x, we know z is inside x. This means z is a proper part of x, so the relationship between x and z must be one of: TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Now, the distinction between these two relations hinges on whether z touches the boundary of x. As I've explained, both are possible:
- If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. The relationship is TPPi(x,z).
- If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z doesn't touch the boundary of x. The relationship is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Let's reason from a different angle to make sure we're not missing anything.

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we know:
- y is a tangential proper part of x.
- z is a tangential proper part of y.

From these, we can derive:
- z is a proper part of y (all of z is inside y, and z ≠ y), and y is a proper part of x (all of y is inside x, and y ≠ x). So, z is a proper part of x (all of z is inside x, and z ≠ x).
- z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x.

Given that z is a proper part of x, the relationship between x and z must be one of:
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The distinction is whether z touches the boundary of x. As I've explained, both are possible. So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

So, the final answer is: TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me see if I can come up with actual examples to visualize this.

Example 1: Imagine a nested set of three circles, where each smaller circle touches the boundary of the next larger circle at the same point. In this case, z touches the boundary of y, which touches the boundary of x, and z also touches the boundary of x. This gives us TPPi(x,z).

Example 2: Imagine a nested set of three circles, where the smallest circle (z) touches the boundary of the middle circle (y) at the top, and the middle circle touches the boundary of the largest circle (x) at the bottom. In this case, z touches the boundary of y but not the boundary of x. This gives us NTPPi(x,z).

These examples confirm that both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z.

So, the final answer is: TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to analyze what relationships are possible between x and z given the conditions TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me break down what these conditions mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

From these conditions, I can deduce:
- z is definitely inside x (since z is inside y, which is inside x)
- z is a proper part of x (z is completely inside x and not equal to x)

The question is whether z touches the boundary of x or not. There are two possibilities:

1. If z touches y's boundary at a point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary. This gives us TPPi(x,z).

2. If z touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch x's boundary (i.e., at points in the interior of x), then z doesn't touch x's boundary. This gives us NTPPi(x,z).

Both scenarios are geometrically possible, so both relations are possible.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
