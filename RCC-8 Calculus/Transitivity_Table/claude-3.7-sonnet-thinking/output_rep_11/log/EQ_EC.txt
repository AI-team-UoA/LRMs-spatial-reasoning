PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the RCC-8 relations and what we can deduce from the given conditions.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same spatial region. This means that x has the same relationship with z as y does with z.

Given that EC(y,z) (y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts), and x is coincident with y, it follows that x must also touch z at a boundary without sharing interior parts.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is:

EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

To verify this, let's consider each of the RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected, which contradicts that x is equivalent to y and y touches z (EC relationship).

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is consistent with the given information since y and z have an EC relationship, and x is equivalent to y.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share a spatial part, which contradicts that y and z only touch at the boundary (EC) and x is equivalent to y.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, which contradicts that y is not part of z (they have an EC relationship) and x is equivalent to y.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which contradicts that y is not part of z and x is equivalent to y.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, which contradicts that z is not part of y (they have an EC relationship) and x is equivalent to y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which contradicts that z is not part of y and x is equivalent to y.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident, which contradicts that y and z only touch at the boundary (EC) and x is equivalent to y.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Actually, let me re-examine this. I want to be careful here.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts

Since EQ(x,y), we know that x and y occupy exactly the same space. They have the same interior, the same boundary, etc.

Since EC(y,z), we know that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

Given that x and y are coincident (EQ), x must have the exact same relationship with z as y does with z. Since y has an EC relationship with z, x must also have an EC relationship with z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

To double-check: if x and y occupy the exact same space (EQ), and y touches z at a boundary (EC), then x must also touch z at that same boundary in the exact same way. There's no other possibility given the constraints of the RCC-8 calculus.

So, the answer is: EC(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given the two conditions.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts

Since EQ(x,y), this means that x and y are identical spatial regions - they have the same interior and the same boundary. Therefore, x must have exactly the same spatial relationship with z as y does with z.

Given that y and z have the EC relationship (they touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts), and x is coincident with y, it follows that x must also touch z at the boundary without sharing interior parts.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).
