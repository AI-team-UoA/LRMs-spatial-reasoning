PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step to find the possible relationships between x and z.

We have:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is fully contained within y without touching y's boundary.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, meaning they share no spatial parts.

Now, let's determine what the relationship between x and z could be:

1. Since x is fully contained within y (NTPP(x,y)), and y shares no parts with z (DC(y,z)), it follows that x cannot share any parts with z either. 

2. If x cannot share any parts with z, then the possible relations between x and z are limited to those that involve no spatial overlap.

3. The only RCC-8 relation that specifies no spatial overlap is DC (disconnected).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z) - they are disconnected.

Let me double-check this by ruling out other relations:
- EC(x,z) - impossible because x is strictly inside y, so x cannot touch the boundary of z if y and z are disconnected.
- PO(x,z) - impossible because it would require x and z to share some part, but z shares no part with y (which contains x).
- TPP(x,z) - impossible because it would require x to be part of z, but x is fully contained in y which is disconnected from z.
- NTPP(x,z) - impossible for the same reason as TPP.
- TPPi(x,z) - impossible because it would mean z is a part of x, but x is fully contained in y which is disconnected from z.
- NTPPi(x,z) - impossible for the same reason as TPPi.
- EQ(x,z) - impossible because it would mean x and z are the same, but x is contained in y which is disconnected from z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me think about this more carefully. We know:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y that doesn't touch y's boundary
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (share no points)

Given that x is completely contained within y (not even touching the boundary of y), and y is completely disconnected from z, there's no way for x to have any connection with z. If y and z don't share any points, and x is fully within y, then x and z cannot share any points either.

So the only possible relation between x and z is DC(x,z) - they are disconnected.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationship(s) can exist between x and z based on the given information:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (they share no points)

Analysis:
Since x is completely contained within y (not even touching y's boundary), and y shares no points with z, it follows that x cannot share any points with z either.

Looking at all possible RCC-8 relations:
- DC: Objects share no points
- EC: Objects touch at boundaries only
- PO: Objects partially overlap
- TPP: Object is a tangential proper part
- NTPP: Object is a non-tangential proper part
- TPPi: Object contains another as a tangential proper part
- NTPPi: Object contains another as a non-tangential proper part
- EQ: Objects are equal

Since x is fully contained in y, and y shares no space with z, the only possible relation is that x and z are disconnected.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
