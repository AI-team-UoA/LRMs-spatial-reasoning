PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think about the possible relationships between x and z given that PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. So they share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
PO(y,z) means that y and z partially overlap. So they share some part, but neither is fully contained in the other.

Now I need to figure out what the relation between x and z could be. Let me go through each of the possible relations:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected
2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected (touch at boundary)
3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal

Let's think about these possibilities:

- DC(x,z): This is possible. Even though x and y share some part, and y and z share some part, the parts they share could be different. So x and z might not share any part at all.

- EC(x,z): This is also possible. If x and y overlap in one area, and y and z overlap in another area, then x and z might just touch at their boundaries.

- PO(x,z): Definitely possible. If the overlapping parts between x and y and between y and z have some common area, then x and z would partially overlap.

- TPP(x,z): This means x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary. This could happen if the overlapping part between x and y is mostly in z, and the rest of x is also in z.

- NTPP(x,z): This means x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similar to the TPP case, this could happen if x is "deep inside" z.

- TPPi(x,z): This means z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary. By similar reasoning as TPP, this is possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): This means z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to NTPP but with roles reversed.

- EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is possible if both x and z overlap with exactly the same part of y, and the remaining parts of x and z are also identical.

So it seems like all eight relations are possible. But let me double-check by visualizing some scenarios:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine x and y overlapping in the west, and y and z overlapping in the east, with no overlap between x and z. This gives DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): Similar to above, but now imagine x and z just touching at a boundary. This gives EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): If x, y, and z all have a common overlapping region, but none is contained in another, we get PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): If x is contained within z and touches z's boundary, and also overlaps with y (which also overlaps with z but extends beyond z), we get TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, but x is completely inside z without touching its boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is like TPP but with x and z swapped.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is like NTPP but with x and z swapped.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region, which seems harder to visualize given the constraints. But if y overlaps with exactly the same part of x and z, and the remaining parts of x and z are identical, then x and z could be equal.

On second thought, let me revisit the EQ(x,z) case. If x and z are equal, then PO(x,y) implies PO(z,y) because x and z are the same. So this is consistent with the given constraints.

So, I believe all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning for some of the trickier cases:

For TPP(x,z): We have x properly contained in z, touching z's boundary. We also have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). This means y overlaps with x (but neither is contained in the other) and y overlaps with z (but neither is contained in the other). It seems a bit challenging to have y overlapping with z without completely containing x (since x is inside z), but I think it's possible if y extends outside of z in some direction, and x touches z's boundary in that same direction.

For NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, but now x is completely inside z without touching its boundary. This seems even more challenging to reconcile with PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), but I think it's still possible if y reaches "deep" into z to overlap with x.

For TPPi(x,z): Now z is properly contained in x, touching x's boundary. We have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). This means y overlaps with x (but neither is contained in the other) and y overlaps with z (but neither is contained in the other). This seems possible if y extends outside of x in some direction, and z touches x's boundary in that same direction.

For NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, but now z is completely inside x without touching its boundary. This can be reconciled with the given constraints in a similar way to the NTPP case.

I'm starting to have some doubts about whether all of these relations are really possible. Let me reconsider the constraints more carefully.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y have a common part, but neither is part of the other.
- PO(y,z): y and z have a common part, but neither is part of the other.

Let's now think about specific examples for each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine x is in the west, z is in the east, and y extends across both and overlaps with both. Here, x and z don't overlap at all.

2. EC(x,z): Imagine x is in the west, z is in the east, and they just touch at a point. y overlaps with both x and z. This gives EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): Imagine x, y, and z all have a common overlapping region, but none is contained in another. This gives PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): Let's imagine x is a small region properly contained in z and touching z's boundary. y overlaps with x (but doesn't contain it) and also extends outside of z. This gives TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, but x is now deeper inside z without touching z's boundary. y reaches into z to overlap with x. This gives NTPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Now z is a small region properly contained in x and touching x's boundary. y overlaps with z (but doesn't contain it) and also extends outside of x. This gives TPPi(x,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, but z is now deeper inside x without touching x's boundary. y reaches into x to overlap with z. This gives NTPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are the same region, then both overlap with y in the same way. This gives EQ(x,z).

After this reconsideration, I still believe that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, wait. Let me be very rigorous in my reasoning. To show that a relation R(x,z) is possible, I need to give a specific configuration of regions x, y, and z such that:
1. PO(x,y) holds
2. PO(y,z) holds
3. R(x,z) holds

Let me try to do this for each relation.

1. DC(x,z):
   Imagine:
   - x is the left half of a rectangle
   - z is the right half of the same rectangle
   - y is a rectangle that overlaps with part of x and part of z
   
   In this configuration:
   - PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with part of x but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
   - PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with part of z but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
   - DC(x,z) holds: x and z don't share any part.

2. EC(x,z):
   Imagine:
   - x and z are two rectangles that share an edge
   - y is a rectangle that overlaps with part of x and part of z
   
   In this configuration:
   - PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with part of x but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
   - PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with part of z but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
   - EC(x,z) holds: x and z share an edge but no interior.

3. PO(x,z):
   Imagine:
   - x is a rectangle
   - z is another rectangle that overlaps with part of x
   - y is a rectangle that overlaps with part of x and part of z
   
   In this configuration:
   - PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with part of x but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
   - PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with part of z but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
   - PO(x,z) holds: x and z share a part, but neither is contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z):
   Imagine:
   - x is a small rectangle inside a larger rectangle z, touching z's boundary
   - y is a rectangle that overlaps with part of x and extends outside of z
   
   In this configuration:
   - PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with part of x but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
   - PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with part of z but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
   - TPP(x,z) holds: x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.

Hmm, I'm starting to realize that this case (TPP) and the next couple might be more tricky.

For TPP(x,z), if x is entirely within z, and y overlaps with x, then y must also overlap with z. But then we need to ensure that y does not contain z, otherwise we'd have TPP(z,y) and not PO(z,y). 

Let me rethink this. We need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), which means neither x nor z is contained within y. And we want to have TPP(x,z), meaning x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.

I think we can achieve this by having:
- x is a small rectangle inside a larger rectangle z, touching z's boundary
- y overlaps with x in a way that y is not entirely contained in z, but also doesn't contain all of z

Let me try to describe a specific scenario:
- z is a large rectangle
- x is a smaller rectangle inside z, touching the upper boundary of z
- y is a rectangle that overlaps with the upper part of x and extends above z

In this scenario:
- PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with the upper part of x, but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
- PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with the upper part of z, but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
- TPP(x,z) holds: x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   Now let's try to construct a scenario for NTPP(x,z):
   - z is a large rectangle
   - x is a smaller rectangle inside z, not touching any boundary of z
   - y is a rectangle that extends from the left boundary of z, overlapping with the left part of x, and extending to the left outside of z
   
   In this configuration:
   - PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with the left part of x, but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
   - PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with the left part of z, but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
   - NTPP(x,z) holds: x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

   So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   Let's construct a scenario for TPPi(x,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,x)):
   - x is a large rectangle
   - z is a smaller rectangle inside x, touching the upper boundary of x
   - y is a rectangle that overlaps with the upper part of z and extends above x
   
   In this configuration:
   - PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with the upper part of x, but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
   - PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with the upper part of z, but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
   - TPPi(x,z) holds: z is entirely within x and touches x's boundary.

   So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   Let's construct a scenario for NTPPi(x,z) (which is the same as NTPP(z,x)):
   - x is a large rectangle
   - z is a smaller rectangle inside x, not touching any boundary of x
   - y is a rectangle that extends from the left boundary of x, overlapping with the left part of z, and extending to the left outside of x
   
   In this configuration:
   - PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with the left part of x, but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
   - PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with the left part of z, but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
   - NTPPi(x,z) holds: z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

   So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
   Let's construct a scenario for EQ(x,z):
   - x and z are the same rectangle
   - y is a rectangle that overlaps with part of x (and hence part of z, since x=z)
   
   In this configuration:
   - PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with part of x, but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
   - PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with part of z, but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
   - EQ(x,z) holds: x and z are the same region.

   So EQ(x,z) is possible.

After this more detailed analysis, I'm confident that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

To summarize the possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z):
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

All eight relations are possible.

Actually, let's just quickly double check our reasoning one more time:

1. DC(x,z): We had two rectangles that are disconnected, with a third rectangle overlapping parts of both. This gives PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) with DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): We had two rectangles that share an edge, with a third rectangle overlapping parts of both. This gives PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) with EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): We had two rectangles that partially overlap, with a third rectangle overlapping parts of both. This gives PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) with PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): We had a small rectangle (x) inside a larger rectangle (z), touching the boundary of z. A third rectangle (y) overlaps with part of x and extends outside of z. This gives PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) with TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): We had a small rectangle (x) inside a larger rectangle (z), not touching the boundary of z. A third rectangle (y) overlaps with part of x and extends outside of z. This gives PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) with NTPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This is like TPP but with x and z swapped. We had a small rectangle (z) inside a larger rectangle (x), touching the boundary of x. A third rectangle (y) overlaps with part of z and extends outside of x. This gives PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) with TPPi(x,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is like NTPP but with x and z swapped. We had a small rectangle (z) inside a larger rectangle (x), not touching the boundary of x. A third rectangle (y) overlaps with part of z and extends outside of x. This gives PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) with NTPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): We had x and z as the same rectangle, with a third rectangle (y) overlapping with part of them. This gives PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) with EQ(x,z).

Hmm, actually, in the case of TPP(x,z) (where x is inside z), I said y overlaps with part of x and extends outside of z. But if y overlaps with part of x, and x is entirely in z, then y must also overlap with z. And we need to ensure y doesn't contain all of z, otherwise we'd have TPP(z,y) and not PO(z,y). I think this is still consistent, but let me be more precise about the scenario:

- z is a large rectangle
- x is a smaller rectangle inside z, touching the right boundary of z
- y is a rectangle that overlaps with the right part of x and extends outside of z to the right

In this scenario:
- PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with the right part of x, but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
- PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with the right part of z, but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
- TPP(x,z) holds: x is entirely within z and touches z's boundary.

So this is a valid scenario for TPP(x,z).

Similarly, for the NTPP case:

- z is a large rectangle
- x is a smaller rectangle inside z, not touching any boundary of z
- y is a rectangle that extends from outside of z, through the boundary of z, and overlaps with a part of x

In this scenario:
- PO(x,y) holds: y overlaps with a part of x, but not all of x, and x is not contained in y.
- PO(y,z) holds: y overlaps with a part of z, but not all of z, and z is not contained in y.
- NTPP(x,z) holds: x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So this is a valid scenario for NTPP(x,z).

I've checked all the cases, and all eight RCC-8 relations are possible for x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So the answer is:
DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me examine each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x on the left, z on the right, and y in the middle overlapping with both but neither containing the other.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and z touching at a boundary, with y overlapping parts of both but not containing either.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and z partially overlapping, with y overlapping parts of both.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x inside z touching its boundary, with y overlapping part of x and extending outside of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. Similar to TPP but x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. Imagine z inside x touching its boundary, with y overlapping part of z and extending outside of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. Similar to TPPi but z doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This is possible. If x and z are identical, y can still partially overlap with both.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
