PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully analyze this problem. We are given two spatial relations:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

We need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Let's think about what we know:
- x and y share some common region, but x also has parts outside of y, and y has parts outside of x.
- y is fully contained within z and touches the boundary of z.

What are the possible relations between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? If x is partially outside of y, and y is inside z, could x be completely outside of z? 
   No, this isn't possible because x and y overlap, and y is inside z. So at least part of x (the part that overlaps with y) must be inside z.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected (touching at boundary only)? 
   This could be possible if the part of x that's inside y is only touching the boundary of y where y touches the boundary of z. In this case, x would only touch z at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap?
   Yes, this is possible. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but x could have other parts outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, this is possible. If all of x is inside z, and some part of x touches the boundary of z (which could happen if x touches the boundary of y where y touches the boundary of z), then x would be a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   Yes, this is possible. If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x?
   No, this isn't possible. Since y is inside z, and x partially overlaps with y, x cannot fully contain z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   No, this isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal?
   No, this isn't possible. Since y is a proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, x cannot be equal to z.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check:

EC(x,z): This requires that x and z touch only at their boundaries. If y touches the boundary of z, and x touches the boundary of y at the same place, then x could touch the boundary of z. But the part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z. Actually, upon reflection, I realize that x and z could have only boundary points in common if the part of x that overlaps with y only overlaps with parts of y that are on the boundary of z. So EC is possible.

PO(x,z): The part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z. But x could have parts outside of z as well. So PO is possible.

TPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z (which could happen if x touches the boundary of y where y touches the boundary of z), then x would be a tangential proper part of z. So TPP is possible.

NTPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x is fully inside y and y has some buffer zone between it and the boundary of z. So NTPP is possible.

Actually, I want to check the EC case more carefully. If we have PO(x,y), then x and y share some region, which means there is a non-empty intersection of their interiors. If we have TPP(y,z), then y is completely inside z, including the shared region of x and y. This means that x and z also share a region, which means they cannot be merely externally connected. So EC is not possible.

So I now think the possible relations are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this more carefully.

PO(x,y) means that x and y overlap, but neither is fully contained in the other. TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, so it's fully contained in z and touches the boundary of z.

Given PO(x,y), there's a part of x that's inside y, and a part of x that's outside y. The part of x that's inside y must also be inside z, since y is inside z. But the part of x that's outside y could be either inside or outside z.

If part of x is outside z, then we have PO(x,z). If all of x is inside z, then we have either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z), depending on whether x touches the boundary of z.

Now, can x touch the boundary of z? If x touches the boundary of y where y touches the boundary of z, then x could touch the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is possible. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then we have NTPP(x,z).

So the possible relations are still: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But let me double-check whether DC(x,z) or EC(x,z) could be possible after all.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z would have to be completely separate with no shared points. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, at least part of x must be inside z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would have to touch only at their boundaries, with no overlap. But as we established, part of x must be inside z, so they do overlap. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

I am confident that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me check once more.

If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then we know:
- There's a non-empty intersection of the interiors of x and y.
- y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- Since y is a proper part of z, and there's a non-empty intersection of the interiors of x and y, there's also a non-empty intersection of the interiors of x and z. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).
- Since x has parts outside of y (due to PO(x,y)), and y is a proper part of z, it's possible for x to have parts outside of z as well. This means PO(x,z) is possible.
- It's also possible for all of x to be inside z, making either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) possible, depending on whether x touches the boundary of z.
- Since y touches the boundary of z, and x overlaps with y, it's possible for x to touch the boundary of z as well, making TPP(x,z) possible.
- It's also possible for x to be fully inside z without touching the boundary, making NTPP(x,z) possible.
- Since x has parts outside of y, and y is inside z, it's not possible for z to be a part of x. This rules out TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).
- Since x and y are in a PO relationship, and y is a proper part of z, x and z cannot be equal. This rules out EQ(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me analyze this with the composition table for RCC-8. The composition of PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) gives the possible relations between x and z.

Looking at the RCC-8 composition table, the composition of PO and TPP gives:

PO(x,y) âˆ˜ TPP(y,z) = {DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP}

However, I previously reasoned that DC and EC are not possible. Let me check that reasoning:

If PO(x,y), then x and y have a non-empty intersection of their interiors. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z. Thus, part of x must be inside z as well. This rules out DC(x,z).

Could EC(x,z) be possible? EC(x,z) means that x and z touch only at their boundaries, with no overlap of their interiors. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, part of x must be inside z. So there must be an overlap of the interiors of x and z, which rules out EC(x,z).

So, I'm now thinking that the RCC-8 composition table is suggesting that DC and EC are possible, but my reasoning is suggesting they're not. Let me reconsider.

Actually, I think I need to be more precise about what it means for TPP(y,z). It means that y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. So y is fully contained in z, including its boundary, but y also touches the boundary of z.

Now, if PO(x,y), then x and y overlap, but neither is fully contained in the other. This means that there are parts of x outside of y.

The part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z, since y is inside z. But the part of x that's outside y could be either inside or outside z.

If part of x is outside z, then we have PO(x,z). If all of x is inside z, then we have either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z), depending on whether x touches the boundary of z.

Now, can DC(x,z) be possible? For this to be true, x and z would have to be completely separate. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, at least part of x must be inside z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Can EC(x,z) be possible? For this to be true, x and z would have to touch only at their boundaries, with no overlap of their interiors. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, at least part of the interior of x must be inside the interior of z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, I still believe that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider more carefully. I want to make sure I understand what the RCC-8 composition table is telling us.

Let's think about concrete examples. Suppose we have:
- Region y is a proper part of region z and touches the boundary of z (TPP(y,z)).
- Region x partially overlaps with region y (PO(x,y)).

Now, let's imagine different configurations of x relative to z:

1. Could x be disconnected from z (DC(x,z))? No, because x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, so at least part of x must be inside z.

2. Could x be externally connected to z (EC(x,z))? For this to be true, x and z would have to touch only at their boundaries. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, part of the interior of x must be inside the interior of z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. Could x partially overlap with z (PO(x,z))? Yes, if part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y) and part of x is outside z.

4. Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z))? Yes, if all of x is inside z and x touches the boundary of z.

5. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z))? Yes, if all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

6. Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z))? No, because y is inside z and x overlaps with y but doesn't contain it, so x can't contain z.

7. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z))? No, for the same reason as TPPi.

8. Could x be equal to z (EQ(x,z))? No, because y is a proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, so x can't be equal to z.

So, I'm still concluding that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But the RCC-8 composition table says the possible relations are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Actually, upon further reflection, I realize that I was being too restrictive in my interpretation. Let's consider a specific scenario:

Imagine that y is a circle inside a larger circle z, touching the boundary of z. Now, x is another circle that overlaps with y. If x overlaps with y only in a very small region, and most of x is outside of y, then it's possible for x to be completely outside of z, making DC(x,z) possible. Similarly, x could touch the boundary of z without any part of its interior being inside z, making EC(x,z) possible.

Let me draw this out:

```
    x
   /   \
  /     \
 |       |
 |   y   |
 |  / \  |
 | |   | |
 |  \ /  |
  \     /
   \___/
    z
```

In this diagram, y is fully inside z and touches its boundary. x overlaps with y, but most of x is outside of z. In fact, x and z don't overlap at all; they're disconnected.

So, DC(x,z) is possible. By a similar argument, EC(x,z) is also possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, but there's still something that doesn't seem right to me. If PO(x,y), then the interiors of x and y have a non-empty intersection. If TPP(y,z), then the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z. So, the interior of x and the interior of z must have a non-empty intersection as well. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I think I need to be more careful about what PO, TPP, etc. mean in the RCC-8 calculus.

PO(x,y) means that x and y overlap, but neither is a part of the other.
TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

Given these definitions, let's reconsider:

If PO(x,y), then x and y have a non-empty intersection. 
If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z.

So, the intersection of x and y must be inside z. But x could have parts outside of y, and these parts could be either inside or outside of z.

Could DC(x,z) be possible? For this to be true, x and z would have to be completely separate. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, at least part of x must be inside z or have a non-empty intersection with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Could EC(x,z) be possible? For this to be true, x and z would have to touch only at their boundaries. Since y touches the boundary of z (due to TPP(y,z)), it's possible for x to touch the boundary of z as well, through y. So EC(x,z) could be possible if the overlap of x and y is exactly at the point where y touches the boundary of z.

But let's think about what it means for two regions to "overlap" in the RCC-8 calculus. It means that their interiors have a non-empty intersection. So, if PO(x,y), the interior of x and the interior of y have a non-empty intersection.

If TPP(y,z), then the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z. So, the intersection of the interior of x and the interior of y must be a subset of the interior of z. This means that the interior of x and the interior of z have a non-empty intersection, which rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

So, I still believe that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think this through one more time.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y have a non-empty intersection of their interiors, and neither is a part of the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- Since the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z, and the intersection of the interior of x and the interior of y is non-empty, the intersection of the interior of x and the interior of z is also non-empty.
- This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), which require the interiors of x and z to be disjoint.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Now, let's check each of these:

- PO(x,z): This is possible if part of x is inside z and part is outside.
- TPP(x,z): This is possible if all of x is inside z and x touches the boundary of z.
- NTPP(x,z): This is possible if all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
- TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z would have to be a proper part of x. But since y is a proper part of z and x partially overlaps with y, it's not possible for z to be a part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): For the same reason as TPPi, this is not possible.
- EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z would have to be equal. But since y is a proper part of z and x partially overlaps with y, x and z can't be equal.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

This agrees with my previous conclusion, so I'm pretty confident in it.

Actually, I think I need to double-check my understanding of PO(x,y). It means that x and y have a non-empty intersection, but neither is a part of the other. But I think the regions can share boundary points as well, which could allow for scenarios where x and z are externally connected.

Let me draw out a scenario:

```
      z
 _____________
|             |
|       y    |
|     ___    |
|    /   \   |
|   |     |  |
|___|_____|__|
    |     |
    |  x  |
    |     |
    \___/
```

In this diagram, y is tangentially properly part of z (TPP(y,z)), touching the boundary of z. x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), with some of x inside y and some outside. But, importantly, x and z only touch at their boundaries, making EC(x,z) true.

Actually, this still doesn't seem right to me. If PO(x,y), then the interiors of x and y have a non-empty intersection. If TPP(y,z), then the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z. So, the intersection of the interior of x and the interior of y must be a subset of the interior of z. This means that the interior of x and the interior of z have a non-empty intersection, which rules out EC(x,z).

So, I still believe that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I think the issue with my reasoning is that I was incorrectly thinking about the definition of PO. Let me clarify:

PO(x,y) means that x and y have a non-empty intersection of their interiors, and neither is a part of the other.
TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- Since the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z, and the intersection of the interior of x and the interior of y is non-empty, the intersection of the interior of x and the interior of z is also non-empty.
- This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), which require the interiors of x and z to be disjoint.
- It also rules out TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z), as I reasoned earlier.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Now, there seems to be a discrepancy between my reasoning and the RCC-8 composition table, which says the possible relations are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP.

Let me double-check by looking at the formal definitions of the RCC-8 relations:

- DC(x,y): Â¬C(x,y) (x and y are not connected)
- EC(x,y): C(x,y) âˆ§ Â¬O(x,y) (x and y are connected but do not overlap)
- PO(x,y): O(x,y) âˆ§ Â¬P(x,y) âˆ§ Â¬P(y,x) (x and y overlap but neither is a part of the other)
- TPP(x,y): PP(x,y) âˆ§ âˆƒz[EC(z,x) âˆ§ EC(z,y)] (x is a proper part of y and there exists a region z that is externally connected to both x and y)
- NTPP(x,y): PP(x,y) âˆ§ Â¬âˆƒz[EC(z,x) âˆ§ EC(z,y)] (x is a proper part of y and there does not exist a region z that is externally connected to both x and y)
- TPPi(x,y): TPP(y,x) (y is a tangential proper part of x)
- NTPPi(x,y): NTPP(y,x) (y is a non-tangential proper part of x)
- EQ(x,y): P(x,y) âˆ§ P(y,x) (x and y are equal)

Given these definitions:

- If PO(x,y), then x and y overlap but neither is a part of the other.
- If TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z and there exists a region that is externally connected to both y and z.

From these, can we deduce that the interiors of x and z must overlap? Let's see...

PO(x,y) means O(x,y) âˆ§ Â¬P(x,y) âˆ§ Â¬P(y,x). O(x,y) means that x and y overlap, which typically implies that their interiors have a non-empty intersection.

TPP(y,z) means PP(y,z) âˆ§ âˆƒw[EC(w,y) âˆ§ EC(w,z)]. PP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z, which implies that the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z.

So, if the interiors of x and y have a non-empty intersection, and the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z, then the interiors of x and z must also have a non-empty intersection. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I'm still concluding that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's use the RCC-8 composition table to check my reasoning. This table tells us what relations are possible between x and z, given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

OK, my understanding is that the RCC-8 composition table for PO(x,y) âˆ˜ TPP(y,z) is:

{DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP}

But I've been reasoning that only {PO, TPP, NTPP} are possible. Let me try to understand why the composition table includes DC and EC.

One possibility is that I've been misinterpreting the meaning of PO(x,y) in the RCC-8 calculus. Let me double-check.

PO(x,y) means that x and y overlap but neither is a part of the other. In the RCC-8 calculus, "overlap" means that the interiors of the regions have a non-empty intersection.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z. "Proper part" means that y is entirely contained within z, including its boundary.

Given these definitions, if the interiors of x and y have a non-empty intersection, and the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z, then the interiors of x and z must also have a non-empty intersection. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I believe there might be a misunderstanding in the conventional RCC-8 composition table. It might be assuming a more general interpretation of PO, or it might include a wider set of possibilities to account for certain edge cases.

But based on the definitions of PO and TPP, I still believe that the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me check some reliable references.

OK so let me think about this differently. Let's go back to the definition of the RCC-8 relation.

In RCC-8, a region is a non-empty regular closed set in some topological space. Regular closed means it's the closure of its interior. 

Let me think about the relation PO again. If PO(x,y), then the interiors of x and y have a non-empty intersection, and neither region is contained in the other. This means there must be points in the interior of x that are not in y, and points in the interior of y that are not in x.

Similarly, if TPP(y,z), then y is fully contained in z, and the boundaries of y and z touch. This means that the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z.

Given these conditions, can x and z be disconnected (DC)? Since the interiors of x and y have a non-empty intersection, and the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z, the interiors of x and z must also have a non-empty intersection. This rules out DC(x,z).

Can x and z be externally connected (EC)? Again, since the interiors of x and z have a non-empty intersection, they cannot be externally connected. This rules out EC(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Now, let's check each of these:

- PO(x,z): This is possible if part of x is inside z and part is outside.
- TPP(x,z): This is possible if all of x is inside z and x touches the boundary of z.
- NTPP(x,z): This is possible if all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
- TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z would have to be a proper part of x. But since y is a proper part of z, and x overlaps with y but doesn't contain it, x cannot contain z. This rules out TPPi(x,z).
- NTPPi(x,z): For the same reason as TPPi, this is not possible.
- EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z would have to be equal. But since y is a proper part of z, and x overlaps with y but doesn't contain it, x cannot be equal to z. This rules out EQ(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

This agrees with my earlier conclusion. I'm pretty confident in this answer, despite the discrepancy with what the standard composition table might suggest.

Actually, I think I've been correct all along. Let me try a different approach to make sure.

Let's denote the interior of a region x as int(x) and the boundary as bd(x). Then:

- PO(x,y) means int(x) âˆ© int(y) â‰  âˆ…, x âŠˆ y, and y âŠˆ x.
- TPP(y,z) means y âŠ‚ z and bd(y) âˆ© bd(z) â‰  âˆ….

Given these, we know:
- The interiors of x and y have a non-empty intersection.
- y is fully contained in z, including its boundary.
- The boundaries of y and z touch.

From these, we can deduce:
- Since int(x) âˆ© int(y) â‰  âˆ… and int(y) âŠ‚ int(z), we have int(x) âˆ© int(z) â‰  âˆ…. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).
- Since x is not fully contained in y (from PO(x,y)), and y is fully contained in z, it's possible for x to be not fully contained in z. This makes PO(x,z) possible.
- It's also possible for x to be fully contained in z, making TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) possible, depending on whether x touches the boundary of z.
- Since y is fully contained in z, and x overlaps with y but doesn't contain it, x cannot contain z. This rules out TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).
- For the same reason, x cannot be equal to z, ruling out EQ(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

I think that's right, and I have confidence this is the right answer.

Actually, one thing to check: can EC be possible?

If the interiors of x and y have a non-empty intersection, and the interior of y is a subset of the interior of z, then the interiors of x and z must also have a non-empty intersection. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I am confident in my final answer: the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations tell us:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z; y is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary

Now I'll analyze what relations are possible between x and z:

1. Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, at least some interior points of x must be inside z. This immediately rules out DC(x,z).

2. Since the interiors of x and y have a non-empty intersection, and y's interior is completely inside z's interior, the interiors of x and z must also have a non-empty intersection. This rules out EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z) is possible if some of x is inside z (the part overlapping with y) and some of x is outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) is possible if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. Since y is inside z and x only partially overlaps with y, z cannot be part of x, ruling out TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

7. Similarly, x and z cannot be equal, ruling out EQ(x,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
