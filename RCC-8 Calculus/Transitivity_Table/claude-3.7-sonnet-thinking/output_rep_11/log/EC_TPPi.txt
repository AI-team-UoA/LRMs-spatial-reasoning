PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, I need to figure out what are the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's analyze what these given relations mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Let me sketch this out:

- x is outside of y but touches y's boundary.
- z is inside y and also touches y's boundary.

So the question is: what is the relationship between x and z?

Given that x is outside of y but touches y's boundary, and z is inside y and also touches y's boundary, there are several possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z touch different parts of y's boundary, they would be disconnected.
2. EC(x,z): If x and z touch the same part of y's boundary, they would be externally connected.

Let's think more about this. Since TPPi(y,z) means z is completely contained within y, and EC(x,y) means x is outside of y but touches its boundary, it's also possible that x and z don't touch at all, especially if they touch different parts of y's boundary.

So I believe the possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Let me double-check. 

Actually, let me reason more carefully about this.

From EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
From TPPi(y,z), we know that z is a proper part of y (or equivalently, y properly contains z) and z touches y's boundary.

Now, for the relationship between x and z, I need to consider the possible configurations:

1. x and z might touch at the same point on y's boundary. In this case, the relation would be EC(x,z).
2. x and z might not touch at all. In this case, the relation would be DC(x,z).

I don't see any other possible relationships. x is outside of y, and z is inside y, so x cannot be part of z or vice versa. They also can't overlap.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Let's double check. In the RCC-8 calculus, the possible relations are:
- DC(x,z): Disconnected
- EC(x,z): Externally connected
- PO(x,z): Partially overlapping
- TPP(x,z): Tangential proper part
- NTPP(x,z): Non-tangential proper part
- TPPi(x,z): Tangential proper part inverse
- NTPPi(x,z): Non-tangential proper part inverse
- EQ(x,z): Equal

Given our conditions, x and z can't be equal, one can't be a proper part of the other, and they can't partially overlap. So, the only possible relations are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Let's think of a specific example to be sure:

- Imagine y as a circle.
- x is another circle that touches y at its boundary.
- z is a smaller circle inside y that touches y's boundary.

If x and z touch y's boundary at the same point, then EC(x,z) holds.
If x and z touch y's boundary at different points, then DC(x,z) holds.

Another way to think about it is to consider the composition table of RCC-8. However, I don't have the exact composition table at hand.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Let me think of a few examples to be sure:

1. Consider regions on a plane. Let y be a square, x be a circle outside y but touching its boundary, and z be a triangle inside y and touching y's boundary at the same point as x. Then, EC(x,z) holds.

2. Again on a plane, let y be a square, x be a circle outside y touching its top boundary, and z be a triangle inside y touching its bottom boundary. Then, DC(x,z) holds.

3. Let's try to come up with a different relation, say PO(x,z). For this, x and z would need to partially overlap. But since EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), x is outside y and z is inside y, so they can't overlap. So PO(x,z) is not a possibility.

4. Similarly, for TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ, we would need at least some overlap between x and z, which is not possible given our conditions.

So, the only possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

In fact, I can make this more concrete by thinking of spatial examples. Imagine a city (y) with a building (z) at its edge. A farmland (x) touches the city's boundary. If the farmland and the building touch at the city boundary, then EC(x,z). If they touch the city boundary at different places, then DC(x,z).

So, the answer is: the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Wait, let me check once more. I've been thinking in terms of 2D space, but the question does not specify the dimension, and RCC-8 is dimension-agnostic.

I need to consider whether there are configurations where x and z might have other relationships in higher dimensions. However, the logics I've applied are pretty general and doesn't seem dimension-dependent.

EC(x,y) means x is outside y and they touch at the boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these, the only ways x and z can be related are:
1. They touch at the same point on y's boundary (EC).
2. They don't touch at all (DC).

I believe the answer remains the same: the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me see if there are standard composition tables for RCC-8 I can refer to. The composition of two relations R1(x,y) and R2(y,z) should give us the possible relations between x and z.

Actually, I'm pretty sure about the possibilities now. Let's summarize once more:

EC(x,y) means that x is outside of y but touches y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means that y contains z (z is inside of y) and z touches y's boundary.

For the relationship between x and z, there are only two possibilities:
1. x and z touch at the same point on y's boundary. This gives us EC(x,z).
2. x and z touch y's boundary at different points. This gives us DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

This matches what I've reasoned through multiple times now, so I believe it's correct.

Actually, I just remembered that the composition of RCC-8 relations can be determined through a composition table. For the composition of EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), we'd look at the entry corresponding to these two relations in the table.

I don't have the exact table with me, but based on the logic we've walked through, I'm confident that the result of composing EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) would be {DC, EC}.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Wait, let's think about this once more. Maybe there's a case I haven't considered.

EC(x,y) means x and y are externally connected, which means they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part inverse of z, which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's see if there's any scenario where x and z might have a relationship other than DC or EC.

- PO(x,z): This would mean x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. But since x is outside of y and z is inside y, they can't overlap. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

- TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since x is outside of y and z is inside y, x can't be a part of z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, since x is outside of y and z is inside y, x can't be a part of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

- TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since x is outside of y and z is inside y, z can't be a part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, since x is outside of y and z is inside y, z can't be a part of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

- EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal. But since x is outside of y and z is inside y, they can't be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

The only two possibilities left are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

So, the answer is: the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let's think about this one more time. I'm a bit concerned that I might be overlooking something due to the specific way I'm visualizing the scenario.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
TPPi(y,z) means z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now, the crucial part is to understand where x and z can be in relation to each other:

1. Since x is outside of y and z is inside y, they can't overlap, be equal, or have one contain the other. This rules out PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

2. The only thing left to determine is whether x and z touch. If they do, it would be EC(x,z). If they don't, it would be DC(x,z).

For them to touch, they would need to touch y's boundary at the same point. This is possible, especially since both are defined to touch y's boundary. But it's also possible that they touch y's boundary at different points, in which case they would be disconnected.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I've reasoned through this multiple times and each time arrived at the same conclusion. I'm confident in this answer.

Actually, let me think one more time using a slightly different approach, to be absolutely sure. I'll use the qualitative reasoning approach of the RCC-8 calculus:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part inverse of z. Equivalently, z is a tangential proper part of y. z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

For a relationship between x and z, I need to check all 8 possible RCC-8 relations and see which ones are consistent with the given information:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z touch y's boundary at different points.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if x and z touch y's boundary at the same point.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. But since x is outside of y (from EC(x,y)) and z is inside y (from TPPi(y,z)), they can't overlap. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z. But x is outside of y, and z is inside y, so x can't be inside z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, x would need to be inside z, which is not possible given our conditions. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x. But z is inside y, and x is outside of y, so z can't be inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, z would need to be inside x, which is not possible given our conditions. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. But x is outside of y and z is inside y, so they can't be equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the only possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

My final answer is: The possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, I have to be careful about one thing: In the context of RCC-8, the term "disconnected" (DC) means the regions do not share any point, while "externally connected" (EC) means they share a boundary point. 

Let's revisit our reasoning:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y share a boundary point.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y (y contains z) and z shares a boundary point with y.

For x and z:

1. If x and z touch y at the same boundary point, then they share a point, which means they are externally connected: EC(x,z).
2. If x and z touch y at different boundary points, then they don't share any point, which means they are disconnected: DC(x,z).

So, our final answer is: The possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, I want to be really thorough here. Let's look at this from a different angle:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): y contains z, and z touches the boundary of y.

We can reason in terms of points in the regions. Let's denote the boundary of a region r as bd(r) and the interior of a region as int(r).

From EC(x,y), we know that:
- bd(x) ∩ bd(y) is non-empty (they touch at the boundary).
- int(x) ∩ int(y) is empty (they don't overlap).

From TPPi(y,z), we know that:
- int(z) ⊆ int(y) (the interior of z is a subset of the interior of y).
- bd(z) ∩ bd(y) is non-empty (z touches the boundary of y).

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

For EC(x,z) to hold:
- bd(x) ∩ bd(z) must be non-empty.
- int(x) ∩ int(z) must be empty.

Given our conditions, int(x) ∩ int(z) is already empty (since int(x) ∩ int(y) is empty and int(z) ⊆ int(y)). 

As for bd(x) ∩ bd(z), it can be non-empty if there's a point p such that:
p ∈ bd(x) ∩ bd(y) (from EC(x,y)).
p ∈ bd(z) ∩ bd(y) (from TPPi(y,z)).

In other words, if x and z touch y at the same boundary point, then EC(x,z) holds.

For DC(x,z) to hold, x and z must not share any point, which means bd(x) ∩ bd(z) must be empty. This is possible if x and z touch y at different boundary points.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I'll summarize my reasoning once more to ensure clarity:

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
- TPPi(y,z): y contains z, and z touches the boundary of y.

For the relationship between x and z:

1. Since x is outside of y and z is inside y, they can't overlap, be equal, or have one contain the other. This rules out PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

2. The only thing left to determine is whether x and z touch. 
   - If they touch (which can happen if they touch y's boundary at the same point), then EC(x,z) holds.
   - If they don't touch (which can happen if they touch y's boundary at different points), then DC(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

My final answer is: The possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, I just want to check one more time with some drawings. Let's visualize the scenario:

For EC(x,y), I can visualize x and y as two adjacent regions that share a boundary:
x: [ ]
y: [ ]
(Here, the shared boundary is represented by the `]` `[` pair).

For TPPi(y,z), y contains z, and z touches the boundary of y:
y: [   z   ]
(Here, z is inside y and touches y's boundary on one side).

Now, the question is about the relationship between x and z. 

Case 1: x and z touch y at the same boundary point.
x: [ ]
y: [   z   ]
(Here, x and z touch at the shared boundary of x and y).
In this case, EC(x,z) holds.

Case 2: x and z touch y at different boundary points.
x: [      ]
y: [   z   ]
(Here, x and z touch y at different boundary points).
In this case, DC(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually wait, in the ascii art, my representation might not be clear. Let me try to clarify.

For EC(x,y):
```
xxxx|yyyy
```
Here, `|` represents the shared boundary between x and y.

For TPPi(y,z):
```
yyyyzzz|yyyy
```
Here, z is inside y, and `|` represents the shared boundary between z and y.

Now, combining these:

Case 1: x and z touch y at the same boundary point.
```
xxxx|zzz|yyyy
```
Here, x and z touch at the same boundary point. This is EC(x,z).

Case 2: x and z touch y at different boundary points.
```
xxxx|yyyy
    zzzz|
```
Here, x and z touch y at different boundary points. This is DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

My final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me step back and consider one more time, focusing on the meaning of TPPi(y,z).

TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means that z is inside y (z is a proper part of y) and z touches y's boundary.

Now, we have EC(x,y), which means x and y touch at their boundaries.

So, the scenario is:
- x is outside of y, but they touch at their boundaries.
- z is inside y, and z touches y's boundary.

For x and z:
1. If x and z touch y at the same boundary point, they share a point, which means EC(x,z).
2. If x and z touch y at different boundary points, they don't share any point, which means DC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

My final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's break down what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't overlap
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y (meaning z is contained in y and touches y's boundary)

Given these constraints, I can reason about the position of x and z:
- x is outside of y but touches y's boundary
- z is inside y and also touches y's boundary

The possible relationships between x and z are:

1. DC(x,z): This occurs when x and z touch y's boundary at different points, making them disconnected from each other.

2. EC(x,z): This occurs when x and z touch y's boundary at the same point, making them externally connected.

No other RCC-8 relation is possible because:
- They cannot overlap (ruling out PO)
- Neither can be part of the other (ruling out TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi)
- They cannot be equal (ruling out EQ)

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z)
