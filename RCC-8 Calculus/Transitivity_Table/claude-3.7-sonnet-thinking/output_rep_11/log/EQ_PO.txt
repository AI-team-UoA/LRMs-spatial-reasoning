PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step-by-step.

We have:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (identical in spatial extent)
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other)

Since EQ(x,y), x and y occupy exactly the same region. This means x has the exact same relationship with z as y does with z.

Since PO(y,z), y and z partially overlap.

Therefore, x and z must also partially overlap in the same way.

So the relationship between x and z must be PO(x,z).

Let me double-check this by thinking about the definitions again:

EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same region.
PO(y,z) means y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

Since x is exactly the same as y (due to EQ(x,y)), and y partially overlaps with z, then x must also partially overlap with z in exactly the same way.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relation holds between x and z given the conditions EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Since EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region), x has exactly the same spatial properties as y.

Given that PO(y,z) holds (y and z partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained in the other), and x is spatially identical to y, then x must have the same relationship with z that y has.

Therefore, x must partially overlap with z in exactly the same way that y does.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
