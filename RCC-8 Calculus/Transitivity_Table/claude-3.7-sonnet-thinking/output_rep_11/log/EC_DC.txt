PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this systematically. We have the following information:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Now we need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z. Let's go through each of the RCC-8 relations and check if it's possible.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Since y is disconnected from z (i.e., DC(y,z)), and x only touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), it's possible that x is also disconnected from z. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   Even though x touches y at the boundary, and y is disconnected from z, it's still possible for x to touch z at a boundary. This could happen if x and z touch at a point or region that's separate from where x touches y. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Given that x only touches y at the boundary, and y is disconnected from z, it's still possible for x to partially overlap with z. This would happen if part of x extends into the region occupied by z, while neither is fully contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Given that x touches y at the boundary, and y is disconnected from z, it's possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z, with x touching z's boundary at the same place it touches y. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y at the boundary, and y is disconnected from z, for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would have to be entirely contained within z, away from z's boundary. This is possible if the point where x touches y is inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that x touches y at the boundary, and y is disconnected from z, it's possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x, with z touching x's boundary at a different place than where x touches y. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This means z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary. Given that x touches y at the boundary, and y is disconnected from z, it's possible for z to be entirely contained within x, away from x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
   If x and z are coincident, then they occupy the same region. However, we know that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z). If x and z are coincident, then we would have both EC(z,y) and DC(y,z), which is a contradiction because EC and DC are disjoint relations. So EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Let me re-examine case 5: NTPP(x,z). I said this is possible if the point where x touches y is inside z. But wait, if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But if x touches y at the boundary, and y is disconnected from z, then the point where x touches y must be outside z. So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, let me think more carefully about each of the cases.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is clearly possible. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is disconnected from z, then x can be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
   This is also possible. x can touch z at a boundary at a different location than where x touches y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible as well. x can partially overlap with z, even if x touches y at a boundary and y is disconnected from z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This means x is proper part of z, and it touches z's boundary. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is disconnected from z, then the part of x that touches y is also part of x's boundary. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x's boundary must also be part of z's boundary. But then the part of x's boundary that touches y would also be part of z's boundary, which would mean that y touches z, contradicting DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, I see I'm being a bit sloppy. Let me try to visualize this better.

If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at the boundary. So there is a point p that is part of both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

If DC(y,z), then y and z are disconnected. This means there is no point that is part of both y and z.

Now, let's consider the different possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x can be disconnected from z even if x touches y at the boundary and y is disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. x can touch z at a boundary even if x touches y at a different boundary point and y is disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible as well. x can partially overlap with z, even if x touches y at a boundary and y is disconnected from z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z, and x touches z's boundary. If x touches y at a boundary, and y is disconnected from z, then the point where x touches y must be outside z (otherwise y would touch z, contradicting DC(y,z)). But if x is a proper part of z, then all of x must be inside z, which is a contradiction. So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

But I realize I'm making an error here. The boundary of an object is not necessarily a simple shape. For example, z could be a shape with a "hole" in it, and x could be inside that hole, touching y which is also inside the hole but not touching z. In this case, x would be touching z's boundary (from inside the hole), and also touching y, while y is disconnected from z.

Let me try to be more precise.

If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at the boundary. So there is a point p that is part of both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

If DC(y,z), then y and z are disconnected. This means there is no point that is part of both y and z.

Let's check TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z, and x touches z's boundary.
- If TPP(x,z), then all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary.
- We know EC(x,y), so there's a point p that is part of both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.
- If p is inside z, then y touches z at p, which contradicts DC(y,z).
- If p is on the boundary of z, then y touches z at p, which also contradicts DC(y,z).
- If p is outside z, then x is not fully inside z, which contradicts TPP(x,z).

So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Let's check NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z, and x does not touch z's boundary.
- If NTPP(x,z), then all of x is inside z, and x does not touch z's boundary.
- We know EC(x,y), so there's a point p that is part of both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.
- If p is inside z, then y touches z at p, which contradicts DC(y,z).
- p cannot be on the boundary of z, because x does not touch z's boundary.
- p cannot be outside z, because all of x is inside z.

So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation either.

Now let's check TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x, and z touches x's boundary.
- If TPPi(x,z), then all of z is inside x, and z touches x's boundary.
- We know EC(x,y), so there's a point p that is part of both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.
- If z touches x's boundary at p, then z touches y, which contradicts DC(y,z).
- But z can touch x's boundary at a different point q, which is not part of y. In this case, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

Finally, let's check NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x, and z does not touch x's boundary.
- If NTPPi(x,z), then all of z is inside x, and z does not touch x's boundary.
- We know EC(x,y), so there's a point p that is part of both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.
- z does not touch x's boundary, so z does not touch p. Therefore, z does not touch y, which is consistent with DC(y,z).

So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

And we've already established that EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation because it would lead to a contradiction.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z):
- If TPP(x,z), then all of x is inside z, and x touches z's boundary.
- We know EC(x,y), so there's a point p that is part of both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.
- If p is inside z, not touching z's boundary, then y would touch z at p, which contradicts DC(y,z).
- If p is on the boundary of z, then y would touch z at p, which also contradicts DC(y,z).
- But wait, this isn't quite right. The point p is on the boundary of x, but that doesn't mean it's on the boundary of z, even if x touches z's boundary. Let me reconsider.

Hmm, let me think about it differently. If TPP(x,z), then there's a point q where x touches z's boundary. But this doesn't have to be the same point p where x touches y. If p is inside z, not touching z's boundary, and q is a different point on the boundary of x that touches z's boundary, then y could still be disconnected from z, and TPP(x,z) could be possible.

Actually, hold on. If p is a point on the boundary of x, and EC(x,y), so y also contains p, and DC(y,z), so y and z are disconnected. It's not that y is inside z. I think that's where I was going wrong.

Let's see. If p is on the boundary of x, and p is also on the boundary of y, and TPP(x,z), so x is a proper part of z touching z's boundary. If p is also on the boundary of z, then y would touch z at p, which contradicts DC(y,z). So p cannot be on the boundary of z.

This means that the part of the boundary of x that touches y must be inside z, not touching z's boundary. But then y would touch z at p, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), if x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary, then the point p on the boundary of x that touches y must be inside z, not touching z's boundary. But then y would touch z at p, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is also not a possible relation.

Let me make one more attempt to be clear on this.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary. Let's call the set of points where they touch B. Every point in B is both on the boundary of x and on the boundary of y.

Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. This means there is no point that is part of both y and z.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z, and x must touch z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then every point of x is a point of z. But we know that every point in B is a point of x, and also a point of y. So every point in B is a point of both z and y. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a proper part of z, and x must not touch z's boundary. If x is a proper part of z, then every point of x is a point of z. But we know that every point in B is a point of x, and also a point of y. So every point in B is a point of both z and y. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

But wait, I think I'm still making an error. Let's be even more precise. In RCC-8, a region is a set of points. The boundary of a region is not part of the region. When we say two regions touch at a boundary, we don't mean they share points. We mean their boundaries intersect.

So, given EC(x,y), the boundaries of x and y intersect, but x and y don't share any points. Let's call the set of points where their boundaries intersect B. Every point in B is on the boundary of x and on the boundary of y, but not in x and not in y.

Given DC(y,z), the regions y and z don't share any points, and their boundaries don't intersect. So no point is in both y and z, and no point is on the boundary of both y and z.

Now let's check TPP(x,z) again: This means x is a proper part of z, and the boundary of x intersects the boundary of z.
- If TPP(x,z), then every point of x is a point of z, and the boundaries of x and z intersect.
- The boundaries of x and y intersect at B.
- If any point in B is also on the boundary of z, then the boundaries of y and z would intersect, which contradicts DC(y,z).
- So B cannot intersect the boundary of z. But then the boundaries of x and z don't intersect at all, which contradicts TPP(x,z).

So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Hold on, that's not quite right, the boundaries of x and z do intersect if TPP(x,z). I think I'm getting confused. Let me go back to the definitions of these relations.

Actually, I think I've been misinterpreting the RCC-8 relations. Let me revisit the definitions:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. This means x and y don't share any points and their boundaries don't intersect.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected. This means x and y don't share any points, but their boundaries intersect.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. This means x and y share some points, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means every point of x is a point of y, but not vice versa, and the boundary of x intersects the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means every point of x is a point of y, but not vice versa, and the boundary of x doesn't intersect the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of TPP.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is the inverse of NTPP.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal. This means they have the same points.

Given EC(x,y), x and y don't share any points, but their boundaries intersect.
Given DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points and their boundaries don't intersect.

Now let's check each relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is disconnected from z, then x can also be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is also possible. x can touch z at a boundary even if x touches y at a different boundary point and y is disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible as well. x can partially overlap with z, even if x touches y at a boundary and y is disconnected from z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - If TPP(x,z), then every point of x is a point of z, and the boundaries of x and z intersect.
   - Given EC(x,y), the boundaries of x and y intersect, but x and y don't share any points.
   - If every point of x is a point of z, then every point on the boundary of x is on the boundary of z. This includes the points where the boundaries of x and y intersect.
   - But if these points are also on the boundary of z, then the boundaries of y and z would intersect, which contradicts DC(y,z).
   - So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, I think I'm making an error again. The boundary of a region is not part of the region, so points on the boundary of x are not "points of x". Let me try again, even more precisely.

Let's use a different formulation. In the RCC-8 calculus, a region is a non-empty regular closed set, which means it's equal to the closure of its interior. The eight base relations are defined in terms of the topological interiors and closures of regions.

Let's denote the interior of a region x as x° and the closure of x as cl(x). We have x = cl(x°).

The eight base relations are defined as follows:

- DC(x,y): cl(x) ∩ cl(y) = ∅. The closures of x and y don't intersect.
- EC(x,y): cl(x) ∩ cl(y) ≠ ∅, but x° ∩ y° = ∅. The closures of x and y intersect, but their interiors don't.
- PO(x,y): x° ∩ y° ≠ ∅, x° ⊈ y°, y° ⊈ x°. The interiors of x and y intersect, but neither interior is a subset of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x° ⊆ y°, x° ≠ y°, cl(x) ∩ cl(~y) ≠ ∅. The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, and the closure of x intersects the closure of the complement of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x° ⊆ y°, x° ≠ y°, cl(x) ∩ cl(~y) = ∅. The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, and the closure of x doesn't intersect the closure of the complement of y.
- TPPi(x,y): TPP(y,x). The inverse of TPP.
- NTPPi(x,y): NTPP(y,x). The inverse of NTPP.
- EQ(x,y): x° = y°. The interiors of x and y are equal.

Given EC(x,y), we have cl(x) ∩ cl(y) ≠ ∅, but x° ∩ y° = ∅.
Given DC(y,z), we have cl(y) ∩ cl(z) = ∅.

Now let's check each relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): cl(x) ∩ cl(z) = ∅. This is possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is disconnected from z, then x can also be disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): cl(x) ∩ cl(z) ≠ ∅, but x° ∩ z° = ∅. This is also possible. x can touch z at a boundary even if x touches y at a different boundary point and y is disconnected from z.

3. PO(x,z): x° ∩ z° ≠ ∅, x° ⊈ z°, z° ⊈ x°. This is possible as well. x can partially overlap with z, even if x touches y at a boundary and y is disconnected from z.

4. TPP(x,z): x° ⊆ z°, x° ≠ z°, cl(x) ∩ cl(~z) ≠ ∅.
   - If TPP(x,z), then the interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of z, and the closure of x intersects the closure of the complement of z.
   - Given EC(x,y), the closures of x and y intersect, but their interiors don't.
   - Given DC(y,z), the closures of y and z don't intersect.
   - The closure of x intersects the closure of y, so if the interior of x is a subset of the interior of z, then the closure of z would also intersect the closure of y. But this contradicts DC(y,z).
   - Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, I think I'm still not getting this right. The closure of a region includes its boundary, and the interior of a region is the region without its boundary. When we say that the closures of two regions intersect but their interiors don't, it means they touch at the boundary.

Let's try again:

1. DC(x,z): The closures of x and z don't intersect. This is possible if x and z are completely separated.

2. EC(x,z): The closures of x and z intersect, but their interiors don't. This is possible if x and z touch at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): The interiors of x and z intersect, but neither interior is a subset of the other. This is possible if x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of z, and the closure of x intersects the closure of the complement of z.
   - If TPP(x,z), then x is fully inside z, but touches the boundary of z.
   - Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary.
   - Given DC(y,z), y and z are completely separated.
   - If x is fully inside z and touches the boundary of z, and x also touches y at a boundary, then y would have to intersect z, which contradicts DC(y,z).
   - Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of z, and the closure of x doesn't intersect the closure of the complement of z.
   - If NTPP(x,z), then x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.
   - Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary.
   - Given DC(y,z), y and z are completely separated.
   - If x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x also touches y at a boundary, then y would have to intersect z, which contradicts DC(y,z).
   - Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): The interior of z is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the closure of z intersects the closure of the complement of x.
   - If TPPi(x,z), then z is fully inside x, but touches the boundary of x.
   - Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary.
   - Given DC(y,z), y and z are completely separated.
   - If z is fully inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y also touches the boundary of x, it's possible for y and z to still be completely separated if they touch x at different parts of x's boundary.
   - Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): The interior of z is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the closure of z doesn't intersect the closure of the complement of x.
   - If NTPPi(x,z), then z is fully inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
   - Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary.
   - Given DC(y,z), y and z are completely separated.
   - If z is fully inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of x, then y and z would still be completely separated.
   - Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): The interiors of x and z are equal.
   - If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region.
   - Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary.
   - Given DC(y,z), y and z are completely separated.
   - If x and z are the same region, then y would both touch z at a boundary and be completely separated from z, which is a contradiction.
   - Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But let me double-check my reasoning for TPP and NTPP again.

TPP(x,z) means that x is fully inside z, but touches the boundary of z. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary. DC(y,z) means that y and z are completely separated. If x is fully inside z and touches the boundary of z, and x also touches y at a boundary, then y would touch x at a point on x's boundary. Since x is inside z, all of x's points are also in z. If x touches the boundary of z, then there are points on x's boundary that are also on z's boundary. If y touches x's boundary at a point that is also on z's boundary, then y would touch z's boundary, which contradicts DC(y,z). If y touches x's boundary at a point that is not on z's boundary, then that point of x's boundary would be inside z, which means y would intersect z, which also contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) means that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. If x is fully inside z and x touches y at a boundary, then y would intersect z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So my previous conclusion is correct: the possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me once more check my reasoning for TPP and NTPP.

For TPP(x,z), if x is fully inside z but touches the boundary of z, and x also touches y at a boundary, then y must intersect with z. This is because the point where x and y touch must be a point of both x and y. Since x is fully inside z, this point is also a point of z. So y and z share a point, which contradicts DC(y,z). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

For NTPP(x,z), if x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x also touches y at a boundary, then again, the point where x and y touch must be a point of both x and y. Since x is fully inside z, this point is also a point of z. So y and z share a point, which contradicts DC(y,z). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Ah! I see where I've been confused. In RCC-8, all the regions are closed, so they include their boundaries. When we say two regions touch at a boundary, it means they share part of their boundaries. So the point where x and y touch is a point that is part of both x and y.

Given EC(x,y), x and y share part of their boundaries.
Given DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points.

For TPP(x,z), if x is fully inside z but touches the boundary of z, and x also shares part of its boundary with y, then the part of the boundary that x shares with y must be either inside z or on the boundary of z. If it's inside z, then y intersects with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). If it's on the boundary of z, then y shares part of its boundary with z, which also contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

For NTPP(x,z), if x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, and x also shares part of its boundary with y, then the part of the boundary that x shares with y must be inside z. This means y intersects with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hold on, I think I'm still not getting this right. Let me think more carefully about the topological definitions.

In the RCC-8 calculus, regions are non-empty regular closed sets, which means they're equal to the closure of their interior. The boundary of a region is the region minus its interior.

EC(x,y) means that x and y share at least one boundary point, but their interiors are disjoint. That is, they touch but don't overlap.
DC(y,z) means that y and z don't share any points, including boundary points. That is, they're completely separated.

So, given EC(x,y), x and y share at least one boundary point, which we'll call p. This point p is on the boundary of both x and y.
Given DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points, including boundary points. This means no point of y, including p, is a point of z.

Now, let's check each relation for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z don't share any points. This is possible if x and z are completely separated.

2. EC(x,z): x and z share at least one boundary point, but their interiors are disjoint. This is possible if x and z touch at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): The interiors of x and z intersect, but neither interior is a subset of the other. This is possible if x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of z, and x shares at least one boundary point with the complement of z.
   - Given EC(x,y), x and y share at least one boundary point, which we'll call p.
   - Given DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points. This means p is not a point of z.
   - If TPP(x,z), then all interior points of x are interior points of z, and x shares at least one boundary point with the complement of z.
   - Since p is a point of x and p is not a point of z, p must be on the boundary of x and the boundary of the complement of z. This is consistent with TPP(x,z).
   - So TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

Actually, I'm being sloppy again. Let me be more careful.

If TPP(x,z), then the interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of z, and x shares at least one boundary point with the complement of z. That is, x is fully inside z but touches the boundary of z.

Given EC(x,y), x and y share at least one boundary point, which we'll call p. This point p is on the boundary of both x and y.

Given DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points. This means no point of y, including p, is a point of z.

If p is a point of x (since it's on the boundary of x), and p is not a point of z (since it's a point of y and y and z don't share any points), then x is not fully inside z. This contradicts TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Similarly, if NTPP(x,z), then the interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of z, and x doesn't share any boundary points with the complement of z. That is, x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Given EC(x,y), x and y share at least one boundary point, which we'll call p. This point p is on the boundary of both x and y.

Given DC(y,z), y and z don't share any points. This means no point of y, including p, is a point of z.

If p is a point of x (since it's on the boundary of x), and p is not a point of z (since it's a point of y and y and z don't share any points), then x is not fully inside z. This contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually I think there may be some ambiguity in the definitions of the RCC-8 calculus, especially concerning the boundaries. Let me try a different approach.

Let's imagine specific examples of regions x, y, and z that satisfy EC(x,y) and DC(y,z), and see what relations are possible between x and z.

For example, let's imagine x and y as two circles that touch at a single point, and z as a circle that is completely separate from y. Now, what can the relation between x and z be?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are completely separate. This is possible.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a single point. This is possible.
3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible.
4. TPP(x,z): x is fully inside z but touches the boundary of z. This is not possible because the point where x touches y would have to be a point of both x and y. If x is fully inside z, this point would also be a point of z, which contradicts DC(y,z).
5. NTPP(x,z): x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).
6. TPPi(x,z): z is fully inside x but touches the boundary of x. This is possible if z is inside x and touches the boundary of x at a different point than where x touches y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is fully inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. This is possible.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is not possible because if x and z are the same region, then the relation between y and z would be the same as the relation between y and x, which is EC. But we're given that the relation between y and z is DC.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

This matches my earlier conclusion. Let me double-check once more, because I've been wavering.

Given EC(x,y), x and y touch at a boundary. That is, they share at least one boundary point, but their interiors are disjoint.
Given DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected. That is, they don't share any points, including boundary points.

TPP(x,z) means that x is fully inside z but touches the boundary of z. If x is fully inside z, and x touches y at a boundary, then y would have to intersect with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

NTPP(x,z) means that x is fully inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. If x is fully inside z, and x touches y at a boundary, then y would have to intersect with z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

EQ(x,z) means that x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same region, then the relation between y and z would be the same as the relation between y and x, which is EC. But we're given that the relation between y and z is DC. So EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

The remaining relations, DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z), are all possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between regions x and z, given that EC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let me analyze each potential relation:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. If x only touches y at the boundary, and y is completely disconnected from z, then x can also be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x can touch z at a boundary point that is different from where x touches y.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x can partially overlap with z while still touching y at a boundary point that doesn't intersect z.

4. TPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would be completely inside z while touching z's boundary. But x also touches y at a boundary, and since y is disconnected from z, this creates a contradiction.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for similar reasons as TPP. If x were completely inside z, then the point where x touches y would have to be inside z as well, making y and z connected.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be inside x while touching x's boundary at a point that is different from where x touches y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would have the same relation to z as it does to x (EC), but we know DC(y,z).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
