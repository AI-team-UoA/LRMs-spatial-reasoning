PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, given that TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's analyze what these relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means that y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is part of x and touches x's boundary
- y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Now, I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z. Let's consider the possibilities systematically:

1. **DC(x,z)** - x and z are disconnected
   This is not possible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least that part (y). So they cannot be disconnected.

2. **EC(x,z)** - x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interiors
   This is not possible either because y is part of both x and z, which means x and z share interior points (namely, the interior points of y). So they cannot just touch at a boundary.

3. **PO(x,z)** - x and z partially overlap
   This is possible. Since y is part of both x and z, x and z definitely share some space. But x could extend beyond z in some areas, and z could extend beyond x in other areas.

4. **TPP(x,z)** - x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. If x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) holds.

5. **NTPP(x,z)** - x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is possible. If x is completely contained within z but doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

6. **TPPi(x,z)** - z is a tangential proper part of x
   This is possible. If z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) holds.

7. **NTPPi(x,z)** - z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is not possible in this case. If z were completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would also have to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary (since y is part of z). But we know that y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), so this is a contradiction.

8. **EQ(x,z)** - x and z are equal
   This is possible. If x and z occupy exactly the same space, then EQ(x,z) holds.

Let me double-check each of these by thinking about the spatial configurations more carefully:

For PO(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- It's possible that x and z overlap in the region where y is, but x extends beyond z in some areas and z extends beyond x in other areas. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- It's possible that x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- It's possible that x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- It's possible that z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- It's possible that x and z occupy exactly the same space. So EQ(x,z) is possible.

Wait, let me think through NTPPi(x,z) again:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- If z were completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y would also have to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary (since y is part of z). But we know that y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)), so this is a contradiction. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, wait. I made a mistake. Let me revisit my reasoning for NTPPi(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- But we know that y is a proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- And we know that y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)).
- If z is a proper part of x and y is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of x.
- But if z doesn't touch x's boundary (as required by NTPPi(x,z)), and y is a proper part of z, how can y touch x's boundary? This seems like a contradiction.

Actually, I need to be more careful. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, but it doesn't mean that every part of y touches x's boundary. It just means that some part of y touches x's boundary.

So, let's think again:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary
- If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- But we know that y is a proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)).
- And we know that y touches x's boundary (from TPPi(x,y)).
- So, y is a proper part of z, and y touches x's boundary.
- If z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary, can y still touch x's boundary? Yes, it can, if y is at the "edge" of z. Then y can touch both z's boundary and x's boundary.

Actually, let's step back and define these relations more precisely:

- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected (they don't share any points)
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at the boundary but don't share interior points)
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (they share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other)
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is a proper subset of y and x touches the boundary of y)
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is a proper subset of y and x doesn't touch the boundary of y)
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(y,x))
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(y,x))
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal (they occupy exactly the same space)

With these definitions in mind, let's reconsider NTPPi(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper subset of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper subset of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- NTPPi(x,z) would mean NTPP(z,x), which means z is a proper subset of x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- But if z doesn't touch the boundary of x, and y touches the boundary of z, can y still touch the boundary of x? Yes, that's possible. For instance, imagine x as a big circle, z as a smaller circle fully inside x but not touching x's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle touching z's boundary at one point and also touching x's boundary at another point. In this case, TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z) would all hold.

Wait, that doesn't work. If y is a proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)), then y is fully contained within z. If y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), then some part of y is on the boundary of x. But if z is fully within x and doesn't touch the boundary of x (from NTPPi(x,z)), then how can y, which is fully within z, touch the boundary of x? This is a contradiction.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Actually, I need to be more precise about my reasoning. Let's see:

1. TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is fully contained within x and touches the boundary of x.
2. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is fully contained within z and touches the boundary of z.
3. Now, for NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be fully contained within x and must not touch the boundary of x.

But can these three conditions hold simultaneously? Let's see:
- If y is fully contained within z, and z is fully contained within x, then y is fully contained within x. This is consistent.
- If y touches the boundary of z, and z is fully contained within x but doesn't touch the boundary of x, then y doesn't touch the boundary of x (since y is fully contained within z, and z doesn't reach the boundary of x). But this contradicts the fact that y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Let me just check on TPP and NTPP. Could z be a proper part of x? TPP(x,z) means that x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. Given that y is a proper part of x and y is a proper part of z, it seems like x and z must overlap, but it's not immediately clear that one is a proper part of the other.

Let's think about TPP(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- If TPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z.
- But we know that y is a proper part of x. So, if x is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z).
- Also, if x touches the boundary of z, that doesn't contradict any of the given relations.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

Now, let's think about NTPP(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- If NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
- But we know that y is a proper part of x. So, if x is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z).
- However, if x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then y, being fully contained within x, shouldn't touch the boundary of z either. But TPP(y,z) tells us that y does touch the boundary of z. This is a contradiction.

So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning for NTPP(x,z). Let me revisit:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- If NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
- But we know that y is a proper part of x. So, if x is a proper part of z, then y is also a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z).
- Now, if x doesn't touch the boundary of z, can y still touch the boundary of z? Yes, it can. For instance, imagine z as a big circle, x as a smaller circle fully inside z but not touching z's boundary, and y as an even smaller circle touching x's boundary and also touching z's boundary.

Wait, I think I am complicating things. Let me think about the 2D case:

- Imagine z as a big circle.
- Imagine x as a smaller circle inside z.
- Imagine y as an even smaller circle that's inside x.

Now, let's consider the given relations:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x. In our visualization, y is the smallest circle, and it touches the boundary of x, the middle-sized circle. This works.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z. In our visualization, y is the smallest circle, and it's contained within z, the largest circle. But it also needs to touch the boundary of z. Can it do that? If y is contained within x, and x is contained within z, then y is contained within z. But can y touch both the boundary of x and the boundary of z? Not if x is strictly inside z (i.e., if x doesn't touch the boundary of z).

This leads to a realization: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then x must touch the boundary of z. Because if y touches the boundary of x and y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, then x must touch the boundary of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible, but NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

OK, I think I have the result now. But let me double-check my reasoning for PO(x,z) and EQ(x,z):

For PO(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z must share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
- We know that y is a proper part of both x and z, so x and z do share some interior points.
- But it's not immediately clear if one is a subset of the other.

Wait, let me approach this slightly differently. I'll think about it in terms of the constraints on the boundaries and interiors:

- TPPi(x,y) means:
  - Interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x.
  - The boundary of y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means:
  - Interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of z.
  - The boundary of y touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any points. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least y. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. But we know y is part of both x and z, so they share interior points. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible. For instance, x might extend beyond z in some areas, and z might extend beyond x in other areas, but they overlap in the region where y is.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z and x touches the boundary of z. We've already determined that this is possible. If y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, then x must touch the boundary of z. And since y is a proper part of z, it's possible for x to be a proper part of z as well.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. We've determined that this is not possible because if y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, then x must also touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x and z touches the boundary of x. This is possible. For instance, imagine x as a big circle, z as a smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x, and y as an even smaller circle inside z and touching both the boundary of z and the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x. We've determined that this is not possible because if y touches the boundary of x, and y is contained within z, then z must also touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z occupy exactly the same space. This is possible. For instance, if x and z are identical, then TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) can both hold.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Hmm, wait a minute. Let me recheck my reasoning for PO(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- For PO(x,z) to hold, x and z must share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other.
- We know that y is a proper part of both x and z, so x and z do share some interior points.
- Now, is it possible for neither x nor z to be a subset of the other? Yes, if x extends beyond z in some areas and z extends beyond x in other areas.

OK, so PO(x,z) is possible.

Let's also recheck EQ(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z must occupy exactly the same space.
- If x and z are identical, then y is a proper part of both x and z, which is consistent with TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

So, EQ(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I think I should be more precise with all of my reasoning to make sure I have the correct final answer.

Let's define the relations in terms of subsets and boundaries:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected. x ∩ y = ∅.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected. Interior(x) ∩ Interior(y) = ∅, but Boundary(x) ∩ Boundary(y) ≠ ∅.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. Interior(x) ∩ Interior(y) ≠ ∅, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. x ⊂ y, and Boundary(x) ∩ Boundary(y) ≠ ∅.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y. x ⊂ y, and Boundary(x) ∩ Boundary(y) = ∅.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. Equivalent to TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. Equivalent to NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal. x = y.

Now, given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x. y ⊂ x, and Boundary(y) ∩ Boundary(x) ≠ ∅.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. y ⊂ z, and Boundary(y) ∩ Boundary(z) ≠ ∅.

Let's examine each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any points. But we know y is contained in both x and z, so they must share at least y. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior points. But we know y is contained in both x and z, so they share interior points. Thus, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. We know y is contained in both x and z, so they do share interior points. Is it possible for neither x nor z to be a subset of the other? Yes, if x extends beyond z in some areas and z extends beyond x in other areas. For instance, imagine x covering the left half of a region and z covering the right half, with an overlap in the middle where y is. Thus, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z and the boundary of x touches the boundary of z. We know y is contained in both x and z. Can x be a proper subset of z? Yes, if z is larger than x. Does the boundary of x touch the boundary of z? If y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, then x might or might not touch the boundary of z, depending on the exact configuration. But it's definitely possible for x to touch the boundary of z. Thus, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z and the boundary of x doesn't touch the boundary of z. We know y is contained in both x and z. Can x be a proper subset of z? Yes. Does the boundary of x not touch the boundary of z? If y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, can x still not touch the boundary of z? Actually, this doesn't make sense. If y touches the boundary of z and y is within x, then x must also touch the boundary of z. Thus, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x and the boundary of z touches the boundary of x. We know y is contained in both x and z. Can z be a proper subset of x? Yes, if x is larger than z. Does the boundary of z touch the boundary of x? If y touches the boundary of x, and y is contained within z, then z might or might not touch the boundary of x, depending on the exact configuration. But it's definitely possible for z to touch the boundary of x. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x and the boundary of z doesn't touch the boundary of x. We know y is contained in both x and z. Can z be a proper subset of x? Yes. Does the boundary of z not touch the boundary of x? If y touches the boundary of x, and y is contained within z, can z still not touch the boundary of x? Actually, this doesn't make sense. If y touches the boundary of x and y is within z, then z must also touch the boundary of x. Thus, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z occupy exactly the same space. We know y is contained in both x and z. Can x and z be identical? Yes, if they occupy exactly the same space. Thus, EQ(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Let me double-check my reasoning for PO(x,z) by thinking about a concrete example:
- Imagine a square x, and another square z that's partially overlapping with x.
- The overlapping region is another square y.
- y is tangential to both x and z (i.e., y touches the boundary of both x and z).
- In this case, TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and PO(x,z) all hold.

So, PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) by thinking about a concrete example:
- Imagine a big square z, a smaller square x inside z, and an even smaller square y inside x.
- y touches the boundary of x, and y also touches the boundary of z.
- In this case, TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and TPP(x,z) all hold.

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z) by thinking about a concrete example:
- Imagine a big square x, a smaller square z inside x, and an even smaller square y inside z.
- y touches the boundary of x, and y also touches the boundary of z.
- In this case, TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and TPPi(x,z) all hold.

So, TPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning for EQ(x,z) by thinking about a concrete example:
- Imagine a square x, an identical square z (occupying exactly the same space as x), and a smaller square y inside both x and z.
- y touches the boundary of x (which is the same as the boundary of z).
- In this case, TPPi(x,y), TPP(y,z), and EQ(x,z) all hold.

So, EQ(x,z) is indeed possible.

Finally, let me double-check that DC(x,z), EC(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z) are all impossible.

For DC(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z.
- If y is a part of both x and z, then x and z must share at least y. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z.
- If y is a part of both x and z, then x and z must share interior points (at least the interior points of y). But EC(x,z) requires that x and z don't share interior points. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- If NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
- But if y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, then x must also touch the boundary of z (otherwise, how could y, which is inside x, touch the boundary of z?).
- This contradicts the requirement of NTPP(x,z) that x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- But if y touches the boundary of x, and y is contained within z, then z must also touch the boundary of x (otherwise, how could y, which is inside z, touch the boundary of x?).
- This contradicts the requirement of NTPPi(x,z) that z doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Wait a minute, I think I'm making a mistake in my reasoning for NTPP and NTPPi. Let's be more precise:

For NTPP(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- If NTPP(x,z), then x is a proper part of z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.
- Now, if y touches the boundary of z, and y is contained within x, then some part of x must be at the boundary of z. This contradicts the requirement of NTPP(x,z) that x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.
- If NTPPi(x,z), then z is a proper part of x and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- Now, if y touches the boundary of x, and y is contained within z, then some part of z must be at the boundary of x. This contradicts the requirement of NTPPi(x,z) that z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is indeed not possible.

OK so just to summarize: I'm trying to identify the possible relations between x and z given the constraints: TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.

Out of the 8 possible relations, the possible ones are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.

So that's my final answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which of the 8 RCC-8 relations can possibly hold between x and z, given:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x (y is part of x and touches x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of both x and z, they must share at least the region y.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of both x and z, they must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, sharing the region y while each extends beyond the other in different directions.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be properly contained in z while touching z's boundary (since y touches z's boundary and is contained in x).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If y touches z's boundary and y is part of x, then x must also touch z's boundary, contradicting the non-tangential requirement.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be properly contained in x while touching x's boundary (since y touches x's boundary and is part of z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If y touches x's boundary and y is part of z, then z must also touch x's boundary, contradicting the non-tangential requirement.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. x and z can coincide perfectly while both properly containing y.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
