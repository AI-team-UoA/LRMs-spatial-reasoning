PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what the spatial relations DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) tell us.

DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.

Now, we need to determine what relation(s) could hold between x and z.

Let's go through each of the RCC-8 relations systematically:

1. DC(x,z): This is definitely possible. If x and y are disconnected, and y and z are disconnected, then x and z can also be disconnected. 

2. EC(x,z): This is also possible. Even if x is disconnected from y and y is disconnected from z, x and z can still touch at their boundaries without sharing interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z can overlap (share some parts) even if they are both disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be a tangential proper part of z, even if both x and z are disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be a non-tangential proper part of z, even if both x and z are disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be a tangential proper part of x, even if both x and z are disconnected from y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. z can be a non-tangential proper part of x, even if both x and z are disconnected from y.

8. EQ(x,z): This is possible. x and z can be the same (coincident), even if they are both disconnected from y.

It seems that, based solely on the information that DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z. Let me double-check this by considering concrete examples for each relation.

1. DC(x,z): Imagine three distinct circles: x, y, and z, placed such that none of them overlap or touch each other. This gives us DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): Imagine y as a circle, and x and z as two distinct circles that touch y on opposite sides. This gives us DC(x,y), DC(y,z), but EC(x,z).

Oh, wait, I've made a mistake. If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), then x and z cannot touch y. Let me reconsider.

For EC(x,z), imagine three circles: x, y, and z. Place y away from both x and z, but let x and z touch each other. This gives us DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): Place y away from both x and z, but let x and z overlap. This gives us DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): Place y away from both x and z, but let x be a tangential proper part of z. This gives us DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me rethink this once more to be sure. Let's be more precise. 

DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected (they don't touch or overlap).
DC(y,z) means that y and z are disconnected.

Let's consider specific scenarios:

1. DC(x,z): Imagine three separate spheres in 3D space, far from each other. Then x is disconnected from y, y is disconnected from z, and x is disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Imagine y as a sphere far away. Then, imagine x and z as two spheres that touch at a point but don't overlap. In this scenario, DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and EC(x,z) all hold. So, EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Again, imagine y as a sphere far away. Then, imagine x and z as two spheres that partially overlap. In this scenario, DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and PO(x,z) all hold. So, PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): Again, y is far away. Imagine x as a sphere that's inside z and touches z's boundary from the inside. In this scenario, DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and TPP(x,z) all hold. So, TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Again, y is far away. Imagine x as a sphere that's completely inside z without touching z's boundary. In this scenario, DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and NTPP(x,z) all hold. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): Similar to TPP, but with the roles of x and z reversed. Again, y is far away. Imagine z as a sphere that's inside x and touches x's boundary from the inside. In this scenario, DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z) all hold. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar to NTPP, but with the roles of x and z reversed. Again, y is far away. Imagine z as a sphere that's completely inside x without touching x's boundary. In this scenario, DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z) all hold. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): Imagine y as a sphere far away, and x and z as the same sphere. In this scenario, DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and EQ(x,z) all hold. So, EQ(x,z) is a possibility.

So, based on the information given, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Actually, I'm uncertain about this conclusion. Let me think more carefully. 

Let's consider the definition of DC(x,y). This means that x and y do not share any points or boundary. Now, if DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), it means that y is disconnected from both x and z. 

Let's imagine x, y, and z as regions in a 2D plane. 

If y is placed in a specific location, then any region that doesn't overlap or touch y can be considered as a potential region for x or z. 

Given that there are many such regions, and these regions can have various spatial relationships with each other, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z.

For instance, x and z could be disconnected (DC), or they could touch at a boundary (EC), or they could partially overlap (PO), or one could be a proper part of the other (TPP or NTPP or their inverses), or they could be the same (EQ).

So, I believe the correct answer is that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let me summarize. 

Given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)
6. TPPi(x,z)
7. NTPPi(x,z)
8. EQ(x,z)

Which means all of the RCC-8 relations are possible.

Let me just make sure by thinking of a concrete example of regions x, y, and z for each of these 8 cases.

1. DC(x,z): 
- Region x: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 0.5.
- Region y: A circle centered at (5, 5) with radius 0.5.
- Region z: A circle centered at (9, 9) with radius 0.5.
All three regions are far from each other, so we have DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z):
- Region x: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 1.
- Region y: A circle centered at (5, 5) with radius 0.5.
- Region z: A circle centered at (2, 1) with radius 1.
Here, x and z touch at the point (2, 0), so EC(x,z). Both x and z are far from y, so DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

3. PO(x,z):
- Region x: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 1.5.
- Region y: A circle centered at (5, 5) with radius 0.5.
- Region z: A circle centered at (2, 1) with radius 1.5.
Here, x and z overlap but neither contains the other, so PO(x,z). Both x and z are far from y, so DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

4. TPP(x,z):
- Region x: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 0.9.
- Region y: A circle centered at (5, 5) with radius 0.5.
- Region z: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 1.
Here, x is a tangential proper part of z (it's contained in z and touches its boundary), so TPP(x,z). Both x and z are far from y, so DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z):
- Region x: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 0.5.
- Region y: A circle centered at (5, 5) with radius 0.5.
- Region z: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 1.
Here, x is a non-tangential proper part of z (it's completely contained in the interior of z), so NTPP(x,z). Both x and z are far from y, so DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

6. TPPi(x,z):
- Region x: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 1.
- Region y: A circle centered at (5, 5) with radius 0.5.
- Region z: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 0.9.
This is the reverse of case 4. Here, z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,x)). Both x and z are far from y, so DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z):
- Region x: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 1.
- Region y: A circle centered at (5, 5) with radius 0.5.
- Region z: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 0.5.
This is the reverse of case 5. Here, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPPi(x,z) (which is the same as NTPP(z,x)). Both x and z are far from y, so DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z):
- Region x: A circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 1.
- Region y: A circle centered at (5, 5) with radius 0.5.
- Region z: The same circle as x, centered at (1, 1) with radius 1.
Here, x and z are identical, so EQ(x,z). Both x and z are far from y, so DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

So, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Therefore, given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), the possible relations between x and z are all of the RCC-8 relations:
1. DC(x,z)
2. EC(x,z)
3. PO(x,z)
4. TPP(x,z)
5. NTPP(x,z)
6. TPPi(x,z)
7. NTPPi(x,z)
8. EQ(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z given that DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

When we know that DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), this tells us that y is disconnected from both x and z. However, this doesn't constrain the relationship between x and z in any way.

Let me check each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x and z can be completely separate regions
2. EC(x,z): Possible - x and z can touch at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be a non-tangential proper part of z
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be identical

In each case, we can position y to be disconnected from both x and z.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
