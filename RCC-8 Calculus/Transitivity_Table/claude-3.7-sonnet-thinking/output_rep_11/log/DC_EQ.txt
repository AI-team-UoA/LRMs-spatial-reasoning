PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they are the same region)

Since y and z are coincident (EQ), they occupy exactly the same space. This means any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that DC(x,y), and y and z are the same spatial region, we must have DC(x,z) as well.

So the answer is that x and z must be disconnected, i.e., DC(x,z).

Let me double-check this by thinking about the properties of these relations:

If EQ(y,z), then y and z are exactly the same region. They have the same interior, same boundary, and same exterior.

If DC(x,y), then x and y share no points - they are completely separate regions.

Since z is exactly the same region as y, and x shares no points with y, it follows that x must share no points with z either. Therefore, DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

So my final answer is that given DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

Let me analyze this step by step:

1) DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
2) EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident (exactly the same region)

Since y and z are exactly the same spatial region (EQ relation means they are identical), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that x is disconnected from y (DC relation), and z is identical to y, x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
