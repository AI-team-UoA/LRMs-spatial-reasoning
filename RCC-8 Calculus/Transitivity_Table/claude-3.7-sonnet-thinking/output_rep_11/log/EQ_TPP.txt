PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step. We have:
1. EQ(x,y) - x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy the same spatial region.
2. TPP(y,z) - y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationship between x and z.

Given that EQ(x,y), x and y are identical in terms of their spatial extent. They have the same boundaries and interiors.

Given that TPP(y,z), y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
- y is completely contained within z
- y touches the boundary of z

Since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), x has the same spatial properties as y. Therefore, x is also completely contained within z and touches the boundary of z.

So, x is a tangential proper part of z, which is represented as TPP(x,z).

Therefore, the possible relationship between x and z is TPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. The RCC-8 relations are:
1. DC(x,y) - x and y are disconnected
2. EC(x,y) - x and y are externally connected
3. PO(x,y) - x and y partially overlap
4. TPP(x,y) - x is a tangential proper part of y
5. NTPP(x,y) - x is a non-tangential proper part of y
6. TPPi(x,y) - y is a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,y) - y is a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,y) - x and y are equal

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are the same spatial region. So if y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), then x must also be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).

So the answer is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationship holds between x and z given that EQ(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same spatial region with identical boundaries and interiors.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z - y is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

Since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), x has exactly the same spatial properties as y. Therefore, x must also be completely contained within z and must touch z's boundary.

This means that x is a tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
