PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what we know:
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- x is a proper part of y, and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- z is a proper part of y, and touches y's boundary.

What's the relationship between x and z? Let's consider the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible that x and z are disconnected? 
   Since both x and z are within y, they could indeed be disconnected. x is somewhere in the interior of y, and z touches y's boundary but is still contained within y. They don't have to overlap.
   So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts?
   Since x is strictly in the interior of y (NTPP), and z touches y's boundary (TPP), it's possible that they share just a boundary point.
   So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap?
   This means they share some interior points but neither is contained in the other. Since both are parts of y, they could indeed partially overlap.
   So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z?
   For this to be true, x would need to be contained in z and touch z's boundary. Since x is in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z is part of y and touches y's boundary, it's possible that x touches z's boundary but is contained within z.
   So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z?
   This would mean x is contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since both x and z are parts of y, it's possible that z completely contains x in its interior.
   So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. But we know z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't touch y's boundary. If z is inside x, and z touches y's boundary, then x would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).
   So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x?
   This would mean z is completely contained within x's interior. But again, if z touches y's boundary and is within x, then x would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).
   So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal?
   If x and z are equal, then they have the same properties. But we know x doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP), while z does touch y's boundary (TPP). So they can't be equal.
   So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me double-check my reasoning for each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): Yes, it's possible that x and z are disconnected within y.

2. EC(x,z): Wait, I made a mistake. Since x is strictly in the interior of y (NTPP), it doesn't touch y's boundary. But I said earlier that x and z could touch at a boundary. This isn't correct. If x is strictly in the interior of y, and z touches y's boundary, they can't share a boundary point because x is entirely in the interior.
   So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Yes, it's possible that x and z partially overlap within y.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be contained in z and touch z's boundary. But if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, would that mean x touches y's boundary? Not necessarily, because z might have parts of its boundary that don't coincide with y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is still a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Yes, it's possible that x is completely contained within z's interior.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z would be contained in x and touch x's boundary. But if z touches y's boundary, and z is inside x, then x would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).
   So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, if z is completely within x, and z touches y's boundary, then x would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).
   So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): As established, they can't be equal due to their different properties regarding y's boundary.

Let me reconsider EC(x,z) and TPP(x,z) more carefully:

2. EC(x,z): If x is strictly inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary, can they touch at a boundary?
   If x and z touch at a boundary, and z touches y's boundary, would x also touch y's boundary? Not necessarily. z might touch y's boundary at a point that's not where x and z touch. So EC(x,z) could be a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be contained in z and touch z's boundary. But would that mean x touches y's boundary? Not necessarily. x could touch z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) could be a possibility.

Actually, let me reconsider EC(x,z) once more. If x is non-tangential to y, and z is tangential to y, can they be externally connected?

Let's be more precise: NTPP(x,y) means x is in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y touches z's boundary.

If EC(x,z), then x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points. But since x is in the interior of y, and y is part of z, it seems like x would also be in the interior of z, which would mean they share interior points. So EC(x,z) seems unlikely.

Let me think through this step by step again.

NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y, without touching y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means y is inside z, and touches z's boundary.

Let me draw this out conceptually:

x is inside y:
[y [x] ]

y is inside z, touching z's boundary:
[z [y [x] ] ]

Given this arrangement, what's the relationship between x and z?

x is clearly inside z, but does it touch z's boundary? If y touches z's boundary, and x is inside y without touching y's boundary, then x cannot touch z's boundary. So x must be non-tangential to z, which means NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I think I've been approaching this incorrectly. Let me re-evaluate.

NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y, without touching y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means y is inside z, and touches z's boundary.

Let's consider specific examples:
- x could be a small circle in the interior of y.
- y could be a larger circle that contains x, and y is inside z but touches z's boundary.
- z could be an even larger shape that contains y.

But what if z isn't a simple shape like a circle? 

Let's consider:
- x is a small circle in the interior of y.
- y is a C-shaped region (like a horseshoe), with x in its interior.
- z is a complex shape that contains y and forms a "pocket" around it, with y touching z's boundary.

In this case, the relationship between x and z is still NTPP(x,z) because x is inside z without touching z's boundary.

But could there be a scenario where x and z have a different relationship?

Actually, let's be more specific about what "touching the boundary" means. If y touches z's boundary, it doesn't mean the entirety of y touches z's boundary; it just means some part of y touches some part of z's boundary. Similarly, if x doesn't touch y's boundary, it means no part of x touches any part of y's boundary.

So, if x is inside y, and y is inside z, then x is also inside z. But the boundary relationships need more consideration.

Let's reason through each possibility:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected if x is inside y and y is inside z? No, because transitivity of "inside" means x is inside z, so they can't be disconnected.
   So DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Can x touch z's boundary without sharing interior points? Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is inside z. So x and z share interior points, and they can't be just touching at a boundary.
   So EC(x,z) is not a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? For this to be true, part of x would need to be outside z. But since x is inside y, and y is inside z, all of x is inside z. So they can't partially overlap.
   So PO(x,z) is not a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x is inside y, and y touches z's boundary, does that mean x also touches z's boundary? Not necessarily. x could be in the interior of y, and y touches z's boundary at a part that's away from x. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility only if x touches z's boundary.

   However, if x doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (TPPi(y,z)), can x touch z's boundary? Let's think about it: if x touches z's boundary, and y is between x and z's boundary, then x would also touch y's boundary. But we're given that x doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP). So x can't touch z's boundary, which means TPP(x,z) is not a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is inside z without touching z's boundary. Since x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is inside z, x is inside z. And since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y separates x from z's boundary, x can't touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? For this to be true, z would be inside x and touch x's boundary. But we're given that y is inside z, and x is inside y. So z can't be inside x.
   So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? For similar reasons as above, z can't be inside x.
   So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x and z can't be equal.
   So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

Based on this more careful analysis, it seems that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

But wait a second. I realized I've been interpreting TPPi(y,z) as "y is inside z" which isn't fully accurate. TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So the correct interpretation is:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y without touching y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Let me re-evaluate based on this corrected interpretation:

Given that x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and z is inside y and touches y's boundary, what's the relationship between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected within y? Yes, it's possible that x and z are in different parts of y's interior and don't overlap.
   So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): Can x touch z's boundary without sharing interior points? Yes, x could be next to z, touching z's boundary, but not overlapping with z's interior.
   So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they could share some points but neither is completely inside the other.
   So PO(x,z) is a possibility.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. It's possible that z includes x, and x touches z's boundary.
   So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is inside z without touching z's boundary. It's possible that z completely contains x in its interior.
   So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. It's possible that x includes z, and z touches x's boundary.
   So TPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is inside x without touching x's boundary. It's possible that x completely contains z in its interior.
   So NTPPi(x,z) is a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? If they are equal, they have the same properties. But we know x doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP), while z does touch y's boundary (TPP). So they can't be equal.
   So EQ(x,z) is not a possibility.

But wait, there's a contradiction here. I said that both TPP(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) are possibilities, which would mean x is inside z and z is inside x. This can't be right. Let me reconsider.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x needs to be inside z and touch z's boundary. But if z is inside y and touches y's boundary, and x is inside y without touching y's boundary, can x touch z's boundary? If z's boundary is inside y's interior (except for the part that touches y's boundary), and x doesn't touch y's boundary, then x could still touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is still a possibility.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z needs to be inside x and touch x's boundary. But if z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't touch y's boundary, how can z be inside x? It doesn't seem possible. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would need to be inside x without touching x's boundary. But if z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't touch y's boundary, z can't be inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me reconsider DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) as well:

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z need to be disconnected. If both x and z are inside y, and x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, they could be in different parts of y and not touch. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z need to touch at a boundary without sharing interior points. If x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, they could still touch at a point where z's boundary isn't touching y's boundary. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

Ok, I think I'm correct now with:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible
2. EC(x,z) - Possible
3. PO(x,z) - Possible
4. TPP(x,z) - Possible
5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible
6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible
8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible

But wait, I think I've been misinterpreting "boundary" in the context of these relations. Let me try again.

Given that:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's visualize this:
x is inside y, not touching its boundary: [y [x] ]
z is inside y, touching its boundary: [y z]

Hmm, but that doesn't seem like it fully captures TPP. Let me try again with a more precise understanding.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. This means all points of x are interior points of y.

TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. This means all points of z are in y, and at least one point of z is on the boundary of y.

Given this, let's analyze what the relationship between x and z could be:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, it's possible that x and z are in different parts of y's interior and don't overlap.

2. EC(x,z): Can x touch z's boundary without sharing interior points? Yes, x could be adjacent to z, touching z's boundary, but not overlapping with z's interior.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they could share some points but neither is completely inside the other.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. It's possible that z includes x, and x touches a part of z's boundary that's in the interior of y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is inside z without touching z's boundary. It's possible that z completely contains x in its interior.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But if z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't touch y's boundary, z can't be completely inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? For similar reasons as above, z can't be completely inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? If they are equal, they have the same properties. But we know x doesn't touch y's boundary, while z does. So they can't be equal.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

But wait, I've been misinterpreting NTPP and TPP. Let me clarify based on the definitions given:

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's visualize this:
x is inside y, not touching its boundary: [y [x] ]
z is inside y, touching its boundary: [y [z] ]

Now, let's analyze what the relationship between x and z could be:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, it's possible that x and z are in different parts of y's interior and don't overlap.

2. EC(x,z): Can x touch z's boundary without sharing interior points? Yes, x could be adjacent to z, touching z's boundary, but not overlapping with z's interior.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, they could share some points but neither is completely inside the other.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean all points of x are in z, and at least one point of x is on the boundary of z. It's possible that z includes x, and x touches a part of z's boundary that's in the interior of y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This would mean all points of x are interior points of z. It's possible that z completely contains x in its interior.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean all points of z are in x, and at least one point of z is on the boundary of x. But if z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't touch y's boundary, then at least one point of z is on the boundary of y. If this point is also in x, then x would touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? This would mean all points of z are interior points of x. But if z touches y's boundary, then at least one point of z is on the boundary of y. If this point is an interior point of x, then x would touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPP(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not a possibility.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? If they are equal, they have the same properties. But we know x doesn't touch y's boundary, while z does. So they can't be equal.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this.

NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y, not touching its boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means y is tangentially part of z, which means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is inside z (by transitivity). But the question is whether x touches z's boundary.

If y touches z's boundary, and x is inside y without touching y's boundary, then x is separated from z's boundary by at least the space between it and y's boundary. This means x doesn't touch z's boundary. So the relationship is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, I made a mistake. TPPi(y,z) does not mean "y is tangentially part of z". It means TPP(z,y), which means z is tangentially part of y. So z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Let me reconsider based on this corrected interpretation:

- NTPP(x,y) means x is inside y without touching y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given that both x and z are inside y, and x doesn't touch y's boundary while z does, what's the relationship between x and z?

They can be disconnected (DC), externally connected (EC), partially overlapping (PO), or x can be part of z (TPP or NTPP). But z cannot be part of x because z touches y's boundary while x doesn't.

So the possible relationships are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Wait, I need to double-check something.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x needs to be inside z and touch z's boundary. But if x doesn't touch y's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, can x touch z's boundary? Yes, x could touch a part of z's boundary that's in the interior of y.

So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Let me make sure I've got the relations correct:

1. DC(x,z): Disconnected. x and z are inside y but don't overlap. Possible.
2. EC(x,z): Externally connected. x and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap. Possible.
3. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping. x and z share some points but neither is completely inside the other. Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): x is tangentially part of z. x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is non-tangentially part of z. x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is tangentially part of x. z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Not possible if z touches y's boundary and x doesn't.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is non-tangentially part of x. z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Not possible if z touches y's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. Not possible if z touches y's boundary and x doesn't.

So the possible relationships are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Wait, I'm getting confused by the terminology. Let me go back to the definitions provided:

- DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

Given these definitions:

NTPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Yes, it's possible that x and z are in different parts of y's interior and don't overlap.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z touch at a boundary but not share interior parts? Yes, x could be adjacent to z, touching z's boundary, but not overlapping with z's interior.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other? Yes, they could share some points but neither is completely inside the other.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be part of z and touch z's boundary? If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, then sure, TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be part of z but not touch z's boundary? If x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then sure, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be part of x and touch x's boundary? This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. But if z touches y's boundary, and x doesn't touch y's boundary, then z cannot be completely inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be part of x but not touch x's boundary? For similar reasons as above, z cannot be completely inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be coincident? If they are coincident, they have the same properties. But we know x doesn't touch y's boundary, while z does. So they can't be coincident.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me question TPP(x,z) more carefully. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x needs to be inside z and touch z's boundary. But can x touch z's boundary if x doesn't touch y's boundary and z does?

It depends on the shape of z. If z is a simple shape (like a circle) that touches y's boundary at one point, and x is a simple shape (like a circle) inside z, then x could touch z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is a possibility if x is inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

But I don't want to rely too much on visualization. Let me reason more carefully.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x needs to be inside z and touch z's boundary. For NTPP(x,y) to be true, x is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. For TPPi(y,z) to be true, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these conditions, x and z are both inside y, and z touches y's boundary while x doesn't. Can x be inside z and touch z's boundary? I think the answer is yes. z could be a larger shape inside y that includes x, and x could touch z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch y's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Can x be inside z but not touch z's boundary? Yes, x could be completely in the interior of z. So NTPP(x,z) is a possibility.

Are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and PO(x,z) also possibilities? Yes, x and z could be disconnected, externally connected, or partially overlapping within y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Actually, let me just double-check this with an example:

Imagine y is a large circle, x is a small circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z is a small semicircle that's inside y and touches y's boundary.

In this case, x and z could be:
- DC (disconnected) if they are in different parts of y.
- EC (externally connected) if they touch at a point.
- PO (partially overlapping) if they share some interior points.
- TPP (tangential proper part) if x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP (non-tangential proper part) if x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

But z cannot be inside x because z touches y's boundary while x doesn't.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

Hmm, let me double-check TPP(x,z) once more with an example.

Consider y as a large circle, x as a small circle inside y (not touching y's boundary), and z as a larger circle inside y that touches y's boundary.

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is true. But this means x is closer to y's boundary than the distance between z's boundary and y's boundary at the point where they touch. Given that x doesn't touch y's boundary, is this possible?

Actually, yes. z could touch y's boundary at a point, and x could touch z's boundary at a different point, away from where z touches y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is a possibility.

For similar reasons, NTPP(x,z) is also a possibility.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, and NTPP.

I'm pretty confident in this answer now. Let's summarize:

Given NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected within y.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior points.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that NTPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let's clarify what these relations tell us:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary
- TPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to TPP(z,y), meaning z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary

So both x and z are inside y, but x is strictly in the interior while z touches the boundary of y.

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x and z could be in different parts of y without sharing any points
2. EC(x,z): Possible - x and z could touch at their boundaries without overlapping
3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z could partially overlap within y
4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x could be inside z and touch z's boundary (at a point where z doesn't touch y's boundary)
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary

The inverse relations (TPPi, NTPPi) are not possible because z touches y's boundary while x doesn't, so z cannot be inside x. Similarly, EQ(x,z) is impossible since x and z have different relationships with y's boundary.
