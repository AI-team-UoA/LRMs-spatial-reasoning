PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what spatial relationship holds between x and z, given that EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let's recall what these relations mean:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy the exact same space)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are essentially the same spatial region. This means that x has the exact same spatial relations with other objects as y does.

Given that EC(y,z) (y and z touch at a boundary but don't overlap), and since x is coincident with y, we can conclude that x and z would also only touch at a boundary without sharing interior parts.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be EC(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning:

If x equals y (they are the same region), and y externally connects to z, then x must also externally connect to z in exactly the same way.

So the answer is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

Let me analyze the given information:

1. EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space
2. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points

Since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), they have identical spatial properties - same interior, same boundary, and same exterior. Therefore, x must have exactly the same relationship with z as y does with z.

Since y is externally connected to z (EC(y,z)), x must also be externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
