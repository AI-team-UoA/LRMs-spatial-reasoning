PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about what TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) mean, and then we can figure out what the possible relationships between x and z are.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.

So we have:
1. y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
2. y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's think about what the possible relationships between x and z are. We know that y is a proper part of both x and z. This gives us several possibilities:

1. x could be disconnected from z (DC).
2. x could externally connect to z (EC).
3. x could partially overlap with z (PO).
4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP).
5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP).
6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi).
7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi).
8. x could be equal to z (EQ).

Let's go through these possibilities one by one:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? If this were the case, then since y is a part of both x and z, y would have to be part of both disconnected regions, which is impossible. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be externally connected? Again, since y is a part of both x and z, and if x and z only touch at their boundaries, then y would have to be at the boundary of both, which is impossible since y is a proper part of both. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap? Yes, this is possible. We know that y is a proper part of both x and z, so x and z at least share y, which means they overlap. But it's possible that there are parts of x that are not part of z, and parts of z that are not part of x, which would make PO(x,z) true.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean that x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of z (because TPP(y,z)), it's possible for x to also touch the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z? This would mean that x is a proper part of z but does not touch the boundary of z. If TPP(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of x, it seems unlikely that x could be completely contained within z without touching its boundary, given that y touches the boundary of z. However, let me think about it more carefully. It's theoretically possible that y could be a tangential proper part of both x and z, with y touching the boundary of z at points that are not part of the boundary of x. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean that z is a proper part of x and z touches the boundary of x. Since y is a proper part of z, and y touches the boundary of x (because TPPi(x,y)), it's possible for z to also touch the boundary of x. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x? This would mean that z is a proper part of x but does not touch the boundary of x. If TPPi(x,y), then y touches the boundary of x. If TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z. It's theoretically possible for z to be entirely contained within x (not touching the boundary of x) while y (which is a part of z) touches the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible for x to be equal to z? This would mean that x and z are the same region. If TPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x. If TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z. If x and z are the same region, then y would be a proper part of both, which is consistent with our given relations. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again about NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z): This would mean that x is a proper part of z and x does not touch the boundary of z. But if TPP(y,z), then y touches the boundary of z. And if TPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x. If y is a part of x and y touches the boundary of z, then x must also touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

For NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a proper part of x and z does not touch the boundary of x. But if TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z. And if TPPi(x,y), then y touches the boundary of x. If y is a part of z and y touches the boundary of x, then z must also touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

But wait, I think I might have confused myself. Let's think about these relationships differently.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. That is, y is properly contained in x (i.e., y ⊂ x) and touches the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is properly contained in z (i.e., y ⊂ z) and touches the boundary of z.

So, we have y ⊂ x and y ⊂ z, with y touching both the boundary of x and the boundary of z.

Now, let's go through each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because y is a proper part of both x and z, which means x and z must at least share y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z externally connect. This is not possible because, again, y is a proper part of both x and z, which means x and z must share more than just a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. We know that y is a proper part of both x and z, so they at least share y. It's possible that there are parts of x not in z, and parts of z not in x.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. It means that x is properly contained in z (i.e., x ⊂ z) and touches the boundary of z. Since y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of z (due to TPP(y,z)), it's reasonable to think that x might also touch the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that x is properly contained in z (i.e., x ⊂ z) but does not touch the boundary of z. Given that y touches the boundary of z and y is a proper part of x, it might seem like x should also touch the boundary of z. However, it's possible that y touches the boundary of z in a way that keeps x away from the boundary of z. For example, imagine y as a "buffer" between the boundary of z and the rest of x. So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Actually, let me reconsider this. If y touches the boundary of z (due to TPP(y,z)), and y is a proper part of x, then x must contain at least one point of the boundary of z, which means x must touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible. It means that z is properly contained in x (i.e., z ⊂ x) and touches the boundary of x. Since y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of x (due to TPPi(x,y)), it's reasonable to think that z might also touch the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that z is properly contained in x (i.e., z ⊂ x) but does not touch the boundary of x. Given that y touches the boundary of x and y is a proper part of z, it might seem like z should also touch the boundary of x. However, it's possible that y touches the boundary of x in a way that keeps z away from the boundary of x. For example, imagine y as a "buffer" between the boundary of x and the rest of z. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Hmm wait, that doesn't make sense actually. If y touches the boundary of x (due to TPPi(x,y)), and y is a proper part of z, then z must contain at least one point of the boundary of x, which means z must touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is possible. If y is a proper part of both x and z, and all other constraints are satisfied, then x and z could be the same region. But then it seems like x and z would need to be tangentially related to y in the same way, which doesn't quite match with TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Actually, EQ(x,z) is not possible, now that I think about it more. If TPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x. If TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z. If x and z are equal, then y would need to be a proper part of both x and z (which is fine), but y would also need to have the same relationship with both x and z. However, TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are different relationships. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which is the inverse of y being a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)). These can't both be true if x and z are equal.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.

Let me re-check the EQ relationship. EQ(x,z) means x and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy the same spatial region. If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x and y is also a tangential proper part of z. If x and z are the same region, then y would have to be a tangential proper part of both x and z, which doesn't seem contradictory. So, EQ(x,z) should actually be a possible relationship as well.

Let me reconsider all of the relationships:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because y is a part of both x and z, so they must share at least the space occupied by y.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible because, again, y is a part of both x and z, so they must share more than just a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible because if y touches the boundary of z and y is a part of x, then x must also touch the boundary of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible, as explained above.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible because if y touches the boundary of x and y is a part of z, then z must also touch the boundary of x.
8. EQ(x,z): Possible, as explained above. Wait let me double check that reasoning.

EQ(x,z) means that x and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy the same spatial region. If TPPi(x,y), then y is a proper part of x, which means y ⊂ x and there exists at least one point in x that is not in y. Similarly, if TPP(y,z), then y is a proper part of z, which means y ⊂ z and there exists at least one point in z that is not in y.

If x and z are equal, then any part of x is also a part of z, and any part of z is also a part of x. This means that if y is a proper part of x, then y is also a proper part of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z).

But there's a subtle issue here. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y touches the boundary of x. Similarly, TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y touches the boundary of z.

If x and z are equal, then the boundary of x is the same as the boundary of z. So, if y touches the boundary of x, then y also touches the boundary of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z).

However, TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(y,x), meaning that x is a tangential proper part of y. But TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. If x and z are equal, then these two statements are contradictory, because they imply different relationships between y and the common region represented by x and z.

Actually no, I'm confused again. Let me go back to the definitions:

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b. That is, a is properly contained in b (i.e., a ⊂ b) and touches the boundary of b.

TPPi(a,b) means b is a tangential proper part of a. That is, b is properly contained in a (i.e., b ⊂ a) and touches the boundary of a.

So, TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. That is, y ⊂ x and y touches the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y ⊂ z and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, let me go through the possible relationships between x and z again:

If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we have:
- y ⊂ x (from TPPi(x,y))
- y ⊂ z (from TPP(y,z))

If x = z, then the above two statements are consistent. And we also have:
- y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y))
- y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z))

Again, if x = z, then these two statements are the same. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
4. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Let me give concrete examples for each of these relationships to make sure they're all possible:

1. PO(x,z):
   Imagine x is a larger circle, and y is a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x. And z is another larger circle, partly overlapping with x, and y touches the boundary of z. In this scenario, y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and x and z partially overlap.

2. TPP(x,z):
   Imagine z is a large circle, x is a smaller circle inside z and touching the boundary of z, and y is an even smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x. Furthermore, the part of the boundary of x that y touches happens to also be the boundary of z. In this scenario, y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and x is a tangential proper part of z.

3. TPPi(x,z):
   This is the inverse of the TPP(x,z) example. Imagine x is a large circle, z is a smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x, and y is an even smaller circle inside z and touching the boundary of z. Furthermore, the part of the boundary of z that y touches happens to also be the boundary of x. In this scenario, y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and z is a tangential proper part of x.

4. EQ(x,z):
   Imagine x and z are the same circle, and y is a smaller circle inside x/z and touching the boundary of x/z. In this scenario, y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and x and z are coincident.

These examples seem to confirm that PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are all possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Actually, let me double check the EQ case again.

EQ(x,z) means x and z are the same region.
TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

If x and z are the same region, then:
- y is a proper part of x (from TPPi(x,y)) which means y is also a proper part of z (since x = z).
- y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)) which means y also touches the boundary of z (since x = z).

This means that TPP(y,x) and TPP(y,z) are both true. But we're given that TPPi(x,y) is true, which is the inverse of TPP(y,x). So, it seems like there's a contradiction.

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself. Let's be very clear:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This is the same as TPP(y,x).

So, we're given:
1. TPP(y,x) (which is the same as TPPi(x,y))
2. TPP(y,z)

If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. This means that TPP(y,x) is the same as TPP(y,z), which is consistent with what we're given.

So, EQ(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

However, let me double check with the formal definitions to be sure.

RCC-8 has the following 8 relations:
1. DC(x,y): x is disconnected from y.
2. EC(x,y): x is externally connected to y.
3. PO(x,y): x partially overlaps y.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,y): x is equal to y.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, which is the same as TPP(y,x).
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z.

If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. This means that TPP(y,x) is the same as TPP(y,z), which is consistent with what we're given.

Wait, I think I've been getting confused. Let's revisit the definitions and think about it more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which is the same as TPP(y,x). In other words, y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.

So, we have:
1. y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
2. y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's go through each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must have a non-empty intersection.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is not possible because, again, y is part of both x and z, so their intersection must be more than just a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means that there's a part of x that's also a part of z (which is satisfied by y), there's a part of x that's not part of z, and there's a part of z that's not part of x. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means that x is a proper part of z and x touches the boundary of z. Given that y is a part of x and y touches the boundary of z, it's possible for x to also touch the boundary of z. This is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that x is a proper part of z but x doesn't touch the boundary of z. However, since y is a part of x and y touches the boundary of z, x must also touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means that z is a proper part of x and z touches the boundary of x. Given that y is a part of z and y touches the boundary of x, it's possible for z to also touch the boundary of x. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that z is a proper part of x but z doesn't touch the boundary of x. However, since y is a part of z and y touches the boundary of x, z must also touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This would mean that x and z are the same region. If this were the case, then y would be a proper part of both x and z, which is consistent with what we're given. However, TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x. Similarly, TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z. If x and z are the same region, then both of these statements are essentially saying the same thing, which is consistent. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
4. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

To further validate these findings, I'd like to think about some concrete examples to make sure these relationships are all possible.

For example, considering regions on a 2D plane:

1. PO(x,z):
   - Imagine x is a larger circle, and y is a smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x.
   - z is another larger circle that partially overlaps with x, and y is inside z and touches the boundary of z.
   - Here, y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and x and z partially overlap.

2. TPP(x,z):
   - Imagine z is a large circle, x is a smaller circle inside z and touching the boundary of z, and y is an even smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x.
   - The part of the boundary of x that y touches is not part of the boundary of z.
   - Here, y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and x is a tangential proper part of z.

3. TPPi(x,z):
   - This is the inverse of the TPP(x,z) example. Imagine x is a large circle, z is a smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x, and y is an even smaller circle inside z and touching the boundary of z.
   - The part of the boundary of z that y touches is not part of the boundary of x.
   - Here, y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and z is a tangential proper part of x.

4. EQ(x,z):
   - Imagine x and z are the same circle, and y is a smaller circle inside x/z and touching the boundary of x/z.
   - Here, y is a tangential proper part of both x and z, and x and z are coincident.

These examples confirm that PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are all possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, my final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, there's one more example I want to think through. If TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), can x and z be equal?

TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

If x and z are equal, then the boundary of x is the same as the boundary of z. So, y touches the boundary of both x and z, which is consistent with both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). And, y is a proper part of both x and z, which is also consistent with both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

So, EQ(x,z) is possible given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Actually, I think I've been less careful than I should be. Let's state the definitions of each relation. According to the question, the RCC-8 qualitative spatial reasoning calculus includes the following binary spatial relations, which are pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive:
1. DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). So, TPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x). So, NTPPi(x,y) means that y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident.

Given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we have:
- y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's go through each potential relationship between x and z:
1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts. But since y is part of both x and z, they must share at least y as a spatial part. So DC(x,z) is not possible.
2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. But since y is part of both x and z, they must share interior parts. So EC(x,z) is not possible.
3. PO(x,z): This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. Since y is part of both x and z, they definitely share a spatial part. As for whether one is part of the other, we would need to think about it further. But PO(x,z) is at least potentially possible.
4. TPP(x,z): This means x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is part of x and y touches the boundary of z, it's possible that x also touches the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is potentially possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. But if y is a part of x and y touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is part of z and y touches the boundary of x, it's possible that z also touches the boundary of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is potentially possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. But if y is a part of z and y touches x's boundary, then z must also touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.
8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident (they are the same region). Given the constraints we have, x and z both contain y, so they have an overlap. But for them to be the same region, we need to check if this is consistent with the given relations. If x and z are the same, then y is a proper part of both and touches the boundary of both, which is consistent with TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is potentially possible.

Actually let me just draw a concrete example of each case to confirm it's possible. I'll represent regions as circles for simplicity. TPPi(x,y) means y is inside of x and touches x's border. TPP(y,z) means y is inside of z and touches z's border.

1. PO(x,z): Let's have x and z be overlapping circles, and y be a smaller circle inside their overlap that touches both the border of x and the border of z. It's clearly the case that TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) (since y is inside of x and touches x's border, and y is inside of z and touches z's border). And since x and z are overlapping circles, we have PO(x,z). So PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

2. TPP(x,z): Let's have z be a large circle, x be a smaller circle inside z that touches z's border, and y be an even smaller circle inside x that touches x's border. If the point where y touches x's border is not the same as the point where x touches z's border, then it's the case that TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) (since y is inside of x and touches x's border, and y is inside of z and touches z's border). And since x is inside of z and touches z's border, we have TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

3. TPPi(x,z): Let's have x be a large circle, z be a smaller circle inside x that touches x's border, and y be an even smaller circle inside z that touches z's border. If the point where y touches z's border is not the same as the point where z touches x's border, then it's the case that TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) (since y is inside of x and touches x's border, and y is inside of z and touches z's border). And since z is inside of x and touches x's border, we have TPPi(x,z). So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. EQ(x,z): Hmm, let's try to imagine this. We would have x and z be the same region, and y be a proper part of both that touches the boundary of both. Since x and z are the same region, the boundary of x is the same as the boundary of z. So, if y touches the boundary of x, it also touches the boundary of z. This seems consistent with both TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z). I'm pretty confident in this answer, but let's double check that we haven't made any mistakes.

DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Since y is part of both x and z, x and z cannot be disconnected. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Since y is an interior part of both x and z, they do share interior parts. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z): This means x and z share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is possible, as I've shown with an example where x and z are overlapping circles, and y is a smaller circle inside their overlap.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible, as I've shown with an example where z is a large circle, x is a smaller circle inside z that touches z's border, and y is an even smaller circle inside x that touches x's border.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. If y is a part of x and y touches the boundary of z, then x must also touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me reconsider this. Could there be a scenario where y touches the boundary of z, but x doesn't?

Imagine z as a circle, and x as a smaller circle inside z, but not touching the boundary of z. Now, if y is a part of x, how could y touch the boundary of z without x also touching the boundary of z?

If y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of z, then at least some part of y is on the boundary of z. Since all of y is inside of x, this means that x also touches the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. This is possible, as I've shown with an example where x is a large circle, z is a smaller circle inside x that touches x's border, and y is an even smaller circle inside z that touches z's border.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. Using similar reasoning as for NTPP(x,z), if y is a part of z and y touches the boundary of x, then z must also touch the boundary of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. As I've argued, this is consistent with TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), so EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:

1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
4. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Actually let me try to triple check the case for EQ. It wasn't clear to me from the start.

EQ(x,z) means that x and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy the same spatial region.
TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is properly contained in x and y touches the boundary of x.
TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is properly contained in z and y touches the boundary of z.

If x and z are the same region, then the boundary of x is the same as the boundary of z. Given that y touches the boundary of x (from TPPi(x,y)), it would also be touching the boundary of z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z). And given that y is properly contained in x (from TPPi(x,y)), it would also be properly contained in z, which is consistent with TPP(y,z).

Actually, let me reconsider this one more time.

EQ(x,z) means that x and z are the same region.
TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. This is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which means that x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

If x and z are the same region, then:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x (which is the same as z) and touches the boundary of x (which is the same as the boundary of z).
- TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z (which is the same as x) and touches the boundary of z (which is the same as the boundary of x).

These two statements are consistent with each other, so EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z), are:
1. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
4. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

This seems to be the final answer.

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z, given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is part of both x and z, they must share at least region y.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is a proper part of both x and z, they must share interior points, not just boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y in their intersection and touching both boundaries.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a proper part of z that touches z's boundary, with y as a proper part of x touching both boundaries.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If y is part of x and y touches z's boundary, then x must also touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a proper part of x that touches x's boundary, with y as a proper part of z touching both boundaries.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If y is part of z and y touches x's boundary, then z must also touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible. If x and z are identical regions, then y can be a proper part of both that touches their common boundary.
