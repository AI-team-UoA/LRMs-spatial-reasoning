PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step. We know that:
1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.
2. PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap; they share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Now we need to determine what possible relationships can exist between x and z. Let's go through each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible. For example, x could be in one part of y, and z could be in a completely different part of y, with no overlap between x and z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts. This is also possible. For example, x and z could both overlap with y but only meet at their boundaries outside of y.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. For example, x and z could both overlap with y, and also overlap with each other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z). This is possible. The overlap between x and y could be completely contained within the overlap between y and z, and x could touch the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is completely contained within the interior of z). This is possible. The overlap between x and y could be completely contained within the interior of the overlap between y and z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible by the same reasoning as TPP but with roles reversed.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible by the same reasoning as NTPP but with roles reversed.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. This is possible if the parts of y that overlap with x are the same as the parts of y that overlap with z.

So, all eight relations between x and z are possible given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me double-check the case of EQ(x,z). If x and z are exactly the same region, but both partially overlap with y, then indeed EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

So my final answer is that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me check my intuition with some examples:

DC(x,z) example: Imagine y as a large circle, with x as a small circle overlapping the left side of y, and z as a small circle overlapping the right side of y, with no overlap between x and z.

EC(x,z) example: Similar to the above, but x and z are positioned so they just touch at their boundaries.

PO(x,z) example: Imagine x and z as circles that both overlap with circle y, and also overlap with each other, but no circle is completely contained in another.

TPP(x,z) example: Imagine z as a large circle, y as a medium circle, and x as a small circle. Circle y overlaps with both x and z, with x being completely contained in z and touching the boundary of z.

NTPP(x,z) example: Similar to the TPP case, but x is completely in the interior of z and doesn't touch its boundary.

TPPi(x,z) example: This is the reverse of TPP; z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(x,z) example: This is the reverse of NTPP; z is completely contained in the interior of x.

EQ(x,z) example: Imagine x and z as the exact same circle, which partially overlaps with circle y.

Yes, all eight relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, let me double-check my examples to be more careful.

DC(x,z): Imagine y as a "dumbbell" shape (two circles connected by a line). Let x partially overlap with the left circle of y, and let z partially overlap with the right circle of y, with no overlap between x and z.

EC(x,z): Similar to the above, but x and z are positioned so they just touch at their boundaries.

PO(x,z): Imagine three circles x, y, and z arranged so that each pair of circles partially overlaps.

TPP(x,z): This is trickier. We need x partially overlapping with y, y partially overlapping with z, and x being a tangential proper part of z. One way to visualize this is to have z as a large circle, y as a medium circle that overlaps with z, and x as a small circle that is completely inside z, touches the boundary of z, and overlaps with y.

Actually, I realize there's an issue with my TPP example. If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also partially overlaps with y, then y must extend outside of z (since PO means that neither region is contained in the other). But then, the overlap between y and z would not be partial overlap, because part of y would be inside z. 

Let me reconsider. We have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z), and we're asking about the relation between x and z.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. But x also partially overlaps with y, which means part of x is inside y and part is outside. And y partially overlaps with z, which means part of y is inside z and part is outside.

Can we arrange these conditions to be consistent? Let's see... If x is completely inside z (for TPP), and x partially overlaps with y, then the part of y that overlaps with x must also be inside z. But y also has a part outside of z (for PO(y,z)), which doesn't overlap with x.

I think this works! x can be a tangential proper part of z, partially overlap with y, and y can partially overlap with z.

Similarly, we can construct examples for NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi. 

For NTPP(x,z), x would be completely inside the interior of z, not touching z's boundary, and would partially overlap with y. And y would partially overlap with z.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside x and touch x's boundary, z would partially overlap with y, and y would partially overlap with x.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside the interior of x, not touching x's boundary, z would partially overlap with y, and y would partially overlap with x.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the exact same region, and both would partially overlap with y.

So, all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Hmm actually I'm not being careful enough. Let me check once more for each case:

1. DC(x,z): I think this is definitely possible. X could overlap with a part of Y that doesn't overlap with Z, and Z could overlap with a part of Y that doesn't overlap with X.

2. EC(x,z): This seems possible too. X and Z could both overlap with Y, and they could also touch at their boundaries outside of Y.

3. PO(x,z): This is definitely possible. X, Y, and Z could all partially overlap with each other.

4. TPP(x,z): I need to check this more carefully. We need X to be completely inside Z, touch Z's boundary, and partially overlap with Y. And Y needs to partially overlap with Z. I think this is possible. We can have Z as a large circle, Y as a medium circle that overlaps with Z, and X as a small circle that is completely inside Z, touches Z's boundary, and overlaps with Y.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, but X doesn't touch Z's boundary. This should also be possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is the reverse of TPP; Z is completely inside X and touches X's boundary. This also seems possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is the reverse of NTPP; Z is completely inside X and doesn't touch X's boundary. This also seems possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For this, X and Z would be the exact same region, and both would partially overlap with Y. This seems possible.

But let me think of concrete examples for each of these to make sure I'm not missing anything.

DC(x,z): Let Y be a dumbbell shape. X overlaps with the left circle but not the right. Z overlaps with the right circle but not the left. Then X and Z are disconnected.

EC(x,z): Let Y be a dumbbell shape again. X and Z are circles that both overlap with Y's handle, and X and Z touch at a point outside of Y.

PO(x,z): Let X, Y, and Z be circles arranged in a Venn diagram such that each pair of circles overlaps, but no circle is contained within another.

TPP(x,z): Z is a large circle. Y is a smaller circle that overlaps with Z (part of Y is inside Z, part is outside). X is an even smaller circle that is completely inside Z, touches Z's boundary, and overlaps with Y.

NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, but X is completely inside Z's interior, not touching Z's boundary.

TPPi(x,z): X is a large circle. Y is a smaller circle that overlaps with X (part of Y is inside X, part is outside). Z is an even smaller circle that is completely inside X, touches X's boundary, and overlaps with Y.

NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, but Z is completely inside X's interior, not touching X's boundary.

EQ(x,z): X and Z are the exact same circle, and both partially overlap with circle Y.

Yes, all eight relations seem possible between X and Z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Wait, let me double-check the EQ case once more. We have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). If x and z are the exact same region (EQ(x,z)), then we would have PO(x,y) and PO(y,x), which seems fine. So, EQ(x,z) is a possible relation.

So, my final answer is that all eight RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me just make sure of the EQ case. We have PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). If EQ(x,z), then x and z are the same region. So we have PO(x,y) and PO(y,x), which sounds wrong. Let me double-check the definition of PO.

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other. This is not the same as PO(y,x); it's actually equivalent because the relation is symmetric. So I misspoke earlier. If PO(x,y), then PO(y,x) as well.

So if EQ(x,z), then we have PO(x,y) and PO(z,y), which is consistent since x and z are the same region. So EQ(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

So, my final answer is that all eight RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me double-check the tricky TPP(x,z) and similar cases with a simple example.

Imagine a rectangle Z. Inside Z, near its boundary, is a small square X. X touches the boundary of Z. Now imagine a shape Y that looks like a U, where the bottom of the U overlaps with X (inside Z), and the two arms of the U extend outside of Z. Then we have TPP(x,z) because X is completely inside Z and touches its boundary. We have PO(x,y) because X and Y overlap, but neither is contained in the other. And we have PO(y,z) because Y and Z overlap, but neither is contained in the other.

This example confirms that TPP(x,z) is a possible relation. We can modify this example to confirm NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi as well.

For NTPP(x,z), we move X away from the boundary of Z so it's completely in Z's interior.

For TPPi(x,z), we swap the roles of X and Z in the original example.

For NTPPi(x,z), we swap the roles of X and Z and also move Z away from the boundary of X.

So, I maintain that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between X and Z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me quickly double-check the case of EC(x,z). We need x and z to touch at a boundary but not share interior parts. We also need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). One way to achieve this is to have x and z be adjacent regions that touch at a boundary, and have y overlap with both x and z. This seems to satisfy all constraints. So EC(x,z) is indeed a possible relation.

So, my final answer is that all eight RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually now I'm doubting my examples for TPP(x,z) and similar. Let me carefully draw out a scenario for each relation to make sure they are consistent with the given constraints.

Let's start with TPP(x,z).

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z and touch the boundary of z. We also need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z). 

Here's a simple scenario: Imagine a square z. Inside z, along its boundary, is a smaller square x. Now, imagine a shape y that partially overlaps with x (so part of y is inside x and part is outside) and also extends outside of z. Then we have TPP(x,z) because x is completely inside z and touches its boundary. We have PO(x,y) because x and y overlap, but neither is contained in the other. And we have PO(y,z) because y and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other.

This example seems valid and confirms that TPP(x,z) is a possible relation.

For NTPP(x,z), we can modify the above example by moving x away from the boundary of z so it's completely in z's interior.

For TPPi(x,z), we swap the roles of x and z in the original example. So now x is a large square, z is a smaller square inside x and touching its boundary, and y partially overlaps with z and also extends outside of x.

For NTPPi(x,z), we swap the roles of x and z and also move z away from the boundary of x.

So it looks like TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi are indeed possible relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Now let's also check DC, EC, PO, and EQ again:

For DC(x,z), x and z need to be disconnected. We can have y as a dumbbell shape, with x overlapping the left circle and z overlapping the right circle, and no overlap between x and z.

For EC(x,z), x and z need to touch at a boundary but not share interior parts. We can have y as a shape that overlaps with both x and z, and x and z touch at a boundary.

For PO(x,z), x and z need to overlap, but neither is contained in the other. We can have x, y, and z as circles arranged in a Venn diagram such that each pair of circles overlaps, but no circle is contained within another.

For EQ(x,z), x and z need to be the exact same region. We can have x and z as the same square, and y as another square that partially overlaps with x/z.

All of these examples seem valid, so all eight RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let me be extremely careful about the TPP(x,z) case, since I'm finding it tricky to visualize.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z and touch the boundary of z. We also need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Here's a detailed scenario:
- Imagine a large square z.
- Inside z, touching the bottom edge of z, is a smaller square x.
- Now, imagine a U-shaped region y. The bottom of the U overlaps with the top half of x (so it's inside z). The two arms of the U extend upward, passing through the top edge of z and continuing outside of z.

In this scenario:
- TPP(x,z) holds because x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z.
- PO(x,y) holds because x and y overlap (the bottom of the U overlaps with the top half of x), but neither is contained in the other (part of x is not covered by y, and part of y extends outside of x).
- PO(y,z) holds because y and z overlap (the bottom of the U is inside z), but neither is contained in the other (the arms of the U extend outside of z, and z has regions not covered by y).

This scenario confirms that TPP(x,z) is a possible relation given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Now, let's check the NTPP(x,z) case:

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside the interior of z, not touching the boundary of z. We also need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

We can modify the TPP example:
- Imagine a large square z.
- Inside z, away from all edges of z, is a smaller square x.
- Now, imagine a U-shaped region y. The bottom of the U overlaps with the top half of x (so it's inside z). The two arms of the U extend upward, passing through the top edge of z and continuing outside of z.

In this scenario:
- NTPP(x,z) holds because x is completely inside the interior of z, not touching the boundary of z.
- PO(x,y) holds because x and y overlap (the bottom of the U overlaps with the top half of x), but neither is contained in the other (part of x is not covered by y, and part of y extends outside of x).
- PO(y,z) holds because y and z overlap (the bottom of the U is inside z), but neither is contained in the other (the arms of the U extend outside of z, and z has regions not covered by y).

This scenario confirms that NTPP(x,z) is a possible relation given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

For TPPi(x,z), we need z to be completely inside x and touch the boundary of x. We also need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Here's a scenario:
- Imagine a large square x.
- Inside x, touching the bottom edge of x, is a smaller square z.
- Now, imagine a U-shaped region y. The bottom of the U overlaps with the top half of z (so it's inside x). The two arms of the U extend upward, passing through the top edge of x and continuing outside of x.

In this scenario:
- TPPi(x,z) holds because z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- PO(x,y) holds because x and y overlap (the bottom of the U is inside x), but neither is contained in the other (the arms of the U extend outside of x, and x has regions not covered by y).
- PO(y,z) holds because y and z overlap (the bottom of the U overlaps with the top half of z), but neither is contained in the other (part of z is not covered by y, and part of y extends outside of z).

This scenario confirms that TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

For NTPPi(x,z), we need z to be completely inside the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x. We also need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

We can modify the TPPi example:
- Imagine a large square x.
- Inside x, away from all edges of x, is a smaller square z.
- Now, imagine a U-shaped region y. The bottom of the U overlaps with the top half of z (so it's inside x). The two arms of the U extend upward, passing through the top edge of x and continuing outside of x.

In this scenario:
- NTPPi(x,z) holds because z is completely inside the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x.
- PO(x,y) holds because x and y overlap (the bottom of the U is inside x), but neither is contained in the other (the arms of the U extend outside of x, and x has regions not covered by y).
- PO(y,z) holds because y and z overlap (the bottom of the U overlaps with the top half of z), but neither is contained in the other (part of z is not covered by y, and part of y extends outside of z).

This scenario confirms that NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So, I've now carefully checked all eight RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) and confirmed that each is a possible relation between x and z given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Therefore, my final answer is that all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me double-check the EC(x,z) case with a specific example, since I've been having second thoughts:

For EC(x,z), we need x and z to touch at a boundary but not share interior parts. We also need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Here's a detailed scenario:
- Imagine a square x on the left.
- Imagine a square z on the right, such that the right edge of x touches the left edge of z.
- Now, imagine a rectangle y that overlaps with both x and z. The left half of y overlaps with the right half of x, and the right half of y overlaps with the left half of z.

In this scenario:
- EC(x,z) holds because x and z touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts.
- PO(x,y) holds because x and y overlap (the right half of x overlaps with the left half of y), but neither is contained in the other (the left half of x is not covered by y, and the right half of y extends into z).
- PO(y,z) holds because y and z overlap (the left half of z overlaps with the right half of y), but neither is contained in the other (the right half of z is not covered by y, and the left half of y extends into x).

This scenario confirms that EC(x,z) is a possible relation given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Now, let me also recheck the EQ(x,z) case with a specific example:

For EQ(x,z), we need x and z to be the exact same region. We also need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Here's a detailed scenario:
- Imagine a square x/z (since x and z are the same region).
- Now, imagine a rectangle y that overlaps with the bottom half of x/z, and also extends below x/z.

In this scenario:
- EQ(x,z) holds because x and z are the exact same region.
- PO(x,y) holds because x and y overlap (the bottom half of x is covered by y), but neither is contained in the other (the top half of x is not covered by y, and the part of y below x is not covered by x).
- PO(y,z) holds for the same reason as PO(x,y), since x and z are the same region.

This scenario confirms that EQ(x,z) is a possible relation given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So, after carefully checking all eight RCC-8 relations, I confirm that all of them (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible relations between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, let's double check the DC(x,z) case, since it's conceptually simple but I should make sure.

For DC(x,z), we need x and z to be disconnected and share no parts. We also need PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Here's a detailed scenario:
- Imagine a dumbbell-shaped region y, consisting of two circles connected by a thin handle.
- Imagine a square x that overlaps with the left circle of y, but not the handle or the right circle.
- Imagine a square z that overlaps with the right circle of y, but not the handle or the left circle.

In this scenario:
- DC(x,z) holds because x and z are disconnected and share no parts.
- PO(x,y) holds because x and y overlap (x overlaps with the left circle of y), but neither is contained in the other (part of x is not covered by y, and most of y is not covered by x).
- PO(y,z) holds because y and z overlap (z overlaps with the right circle of y), but neither is contained in the other (part of z is not covered by y, and most of y is not covered by z).

This scenario confirms that DC(x,z) is a possible relation given PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

So, after carefully checking all eight RCC-8 relations, I confirm that all of them (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible relations between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Actually, the more I think about this the more I realize how fiddly this could be, let me try to be more careful. We have a partial overlap PO(x,y) and a partial overlap PO(y,z). Let's talk about the 8 possible relationships between x and z.

DC(x,z) means that x and z are totally separated. This is clearly possible, because x can overlap with part of y, and z can overlap with a totally different part of y, as in the dumbbell example.

EC(x,z) means that x and z touch at a boundary, but don't overlap. This is possible too, as per the example I gave earlier, where x and z are adjacent squares that touch, and y is a rectangle that overlaps with part of x and part of z.

PO(x,z) means that x and z partially overlap. This is possible too, as all three regions could partially overlap with each other in a Venn diagram fashion.

TPP(x,z) means that x is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely inside z and x touches the boundary of z. We also have that x partially overlaps with y, and y partially overlaps with z. So part of y is inside x, part of y is outside x but inside z, and part of y is outside both x and z. This seems consistent, as per my detailed scenario earlier.

NTPP(x,z) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, x is entirely inside z and x does not touch the boundary of z. We also have that x partially overlaps with y, and y partially overlaps with z. So part of y is inside x, part of y is outside x but inside z, and part of y is outside both x and z. This seems consistent, as per my detailed scenario earlier.

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely inside x and z touches the boundary of x. We also have that x partially overlaps with y, and y partially overlaps with z. So part of y is inside z, part of y is outside z but inside x, and part of y is outside both x and z. This seems consistent, as per my detailed scenario earlier.

NTPPi(x,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, z is entirely inside x and z does not touch the boundary of x. We also have that x partially overlaps with y, and y partially overlaps with z. So part of y is inside z, part of y is outside z but inside x, and part of y is outside both x and z. This seems consistent, as per my detailed scenario earlier.

EQ(x,z) means that x and z are exactly the same region. We also have that x/z partially overlaps with y. So part of y is inside x/z, and part of y is outside x/z. This seems consistent, as per my detailed scenario earlier.

So, I confirm that all eight RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible relations between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me try to be even more meticulous by using the formal definitions of the relations.

PO(x,y) means that there's a part of x that's also a part of y, and there's a part of x that's not a part of y, and there's a part of y that's not a part of x.

PO(y,z) means that there's a part of y that's also a part of z, and there's a part of y that's not a part of z, and there's a part of z that's not a part of y.

DC(x,z) means that there's no part of x that's also a part of z. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with x is different from the part of y that overlaps with z.

EC(x,z) means that x and z share a boundary point, but no part of x's interior is a part of z's interior. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with x and the part of y that overlaps with z are arranged so that x and z touch at a boundary.

PO(x,z) means that there's a part of x that's also a part of z, and there's a part of x that's not a part of z, and there's a part of z that's not a part of x. This is possible if x, y, and z are arranged in a Venn diagram fashion.

TPP(x,z) means that every part of x is a part of z, and x and z share a boundary point, and there's a part of z that's not a part of x. This is possible as per my detailed scenario earlier.

NTPP(x,z) means that every part of x is a part of z, and no boundary point of x is a boundary point of z, and there's a part of z that's not a part of x. This is possible as per my detailed scenario earlier.

TPPi(x,z) means that every part of z is a part of x, and x and z share a boundary point, and there's a part of x that's not a part of z. This is possible as per my detailed scenario earlier.

NTPPi(x,z) means that every part of z is a part of x, and no boundary point of z is a boundary point of x, and there's a part of x that's not a part of z. This is possible as per my detailed scenario earlier.

EQ(x,z) means that every part of x is a part of z, and every part of z is a part of x. This is possible if x and z are the exact same region, and both partially overlap with y.

So, I confirm that all eight RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible relations between x and z given the constraints PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

ANSWER:

I need to find all possible RCC-8 relations between x and z when PO(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. Consider a dumbbell-shaped y where x overlaps with the left circle and z overlaps with the right circle, with no connection between x and z.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x and z as adjacent regions touching at their boundaries, with y overlapping parts of both x and z.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. All three regions can partially overlap in a Venn diagram arrangement.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. Imagine x inside z touching z's boundary, with y overlapping part of x and extending both within z and outside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. Similar to TPP, but x is completely in z's interior without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. Reverse of TPP - z is inside x touching x's boundary, with y overlapping part of z and extending both within x and outside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. Reverse of NTPP - z is completely in x's interior without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This is possible. X and z can be identical regions that both partially overlap with y.
