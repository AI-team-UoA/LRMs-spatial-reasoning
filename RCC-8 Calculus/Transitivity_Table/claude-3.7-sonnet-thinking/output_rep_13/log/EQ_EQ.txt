PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this question. I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z, given that EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

The relation EQ means that the regions are coincident (essentially the same region).

So, if EQ(x,y), that means x and y are coincident.
And if EQ(y,z), that means y and z are coincident.

Therefore, if x is coincident with y, and y is coincident with z, then x must also be coincident with z. This is because the EQ relation is transitive.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is EQ(x,z).

Let me double-check this by reasoning through the definition of EQ:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y occupy exactly the same space
- EQ(y,z) means y and z occupy exactly the same space

If x and y occupy the same space, and y and z occupy the same space, then x and z must occupy the same space.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

The RCC-8 calculus has specific properties for composition of relations.

In this case, we have:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident

The EQ relation is transitive, meaning that if x equals y and y equals z, then x must equal z.

Since x and y are the same region, and y and z are the same region, then x and z must also be the same region.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
