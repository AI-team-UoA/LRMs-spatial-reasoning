PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We are given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's consider the situation:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- z touches y at the boundary
- We need to figure out how z relates to x

The possible relationships between x and z could be:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Is this possible? If y touches the boundary of x, and z touches y only at the boundary, z could be completely outside x without touching it. But this would mean y's boundary has parts that are not part of x's boundary, which contradicts TPPi(x,y). So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   Is this possible? Yes, if z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z would also touch the boundary of x.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   Is this possible? Yes, z could overlap with x, sharing some parts, but neither being a part of the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? No, because we know y is inside x, and z touches y. So z cannot completely contain x.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? No, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? Yes, z could be inside x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Is this possible? No, because if z is non-tangentially inside x, it wouldn't touch the boundary of x. But since z touches y and y touches the boundary of x, z must also touch the boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   Is this possible? No, because if x and z were the same, and y is a proper part of x, then y would also be a proper part of z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

Let me reconsider NTPPi(x,z). I think I made an error. Just because y touches the boundary of x and z touches y, doesn't necessarily mean z touches the boundary of x. Z could be entirely inside x. 

But wait, if z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, but z touches y, and y touches the boundary of x, that seems contradictory. Let me think...

We know:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

If z touches y at y's boundary, and part of y's boundary is also part of x's boundary, then z would touch x's boundary as well. But it's also possible that z touches y at a part of y's boundary that is not part of x's boundary. In that case, z could be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary.

Actually, wait, if TPPi(x,y), then y is tangentially inside x. This means y touches the boundary of x. But if y is fully inside x, and z touches y only at the boundary, then z must also be inside x. However, if z is tangentially connected to y, and y is tangentially inside x, z could either be tangentially inside x as well, or partially overlap with x, or be tangentially outside x (EC).

Let me reconsider:

TPPi(x,y) means y is tangentially inside x.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

If z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z is not entirely inside x and must either be EC or PO with x. 

If z touches y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x, then z could be entirely inside x, making either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) possible.

Actually, let me be more rigorous. Here's how I'm thinking about it:

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means:
- y is a proper part of x: Every part of y is a part of x, and y is not equal to x.
- y is tangential to x: There's at least one point that's in the boundary of both y and x.

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z share at least one boundary point.
- y and z don't share any interior points.

Now, let's figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

If y is tangentially inside x, and z is externally connected to y, there are three main cases to consider:

1. z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x:
   In this case, z is not entirely inside x. z could be partially inside x, which is PO(x,z). Or, z could be entirely outside x but touch x's boundary, which is EC(x,z).

2. z touches y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x:
   In this case, z could be entirely inside x. If z touches the boundary of x at some other point, it's TPPi(x,z). If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, it's NTPPi(x,z).

3. Both of the above: z touches y at multiple points, some where y touches the boundary of x and some where y does not:
   In this case, z is not entirely inside x and would be PO(x,z).

Actually, I'm not sure if case 2 is completely correct. Let me reconsider.

If TPPi(x,y), then y is tangentially inside x, which means it touches the boundary of x.
If EC(y,z), then y and z touch at their boundaries.

If z touches y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then:
- z is not entirely outside x (otherwise z wouldn't touch y).
- z is not equal to x (because y is tangentially inside x, and z is externally connected to y).
- z is not a proper part of y (because they only touch at their boundaries).
- y is not a proper part of z (for the same reason).

So, z could be:
- Partially overlapping with x: PO(x,z).
- Tangentially inside x: TPPi(x,z).
- Non-tangentially inside x: NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, if z is non-tangentially inside x, then z doesn't touch the boundary of x. But if z touches y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x, and z is entirely inside x, then z would be tangentially inside x, not non-tangentially.

This is quite tricky. Let me visualize these scenarios and reconsider.

Let me reanalyze the scenario more carefully.

TPPi(x,y) means y is tangentially inside x. This means y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   If y touches the boundary of x and z touches y, then z must at least touch x's boundary. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me think more carefully. I'm confusing myself. 

TPPi(x,y) means y is tangentially inside x. "Tangentially" means y touches the boundary of x.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z must not share any points. But if y is inside x and z touches y, then z and x must share at least the point where z touches y. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at their boundaries but not share interior points. This is possible if z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some parts but neither is completely inside the other. This is possible if z extends both inside and outside of x.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be tangentially inside z. But this would mean z completely contains x, which isn't compatible with EC(y,z) because y is inside x.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be non-tangentially inside z. This is also not compatible with EC(y,z) for the same reason.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be tangentially inside x. This is possible if z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be non-tangentially inside x. This is possible if z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be the same. But if y is tangentially inside x and z touches y at the boundary, then z can't be the same as x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's double-check the NTPPi(x,z) case, which means z is non-tangentially inside x. If z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, but z touches y, and y touches the boundary of x, we need to make sure this is geometrically possible.

Actually, let me reconsider NTPPi(x,z). For this to be true:
- z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- z touches y at y's boundary.
- y touches the boundary of x.

Hmm, let me think about a specific example. Imagine x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x, and z is another small circle that touches y but doesn't touch the boundary of x. Yes, this arrangement is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider once more. I think I might be overthinking this.

- TPPi(x,y) means y is tangentially inside x. This means y is inside x and touches the boundary of x.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now, I'll think about the possible relationships between x and z based on the given constraints.

DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any points. If y is inside x and z touches y, then z and x must share at least the point where z touches y. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. If z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z would also touch the boundary of x. This arrangement is possible.

PO(x,z): This means x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z extends both inside and outside of x.

TPP(x,z): This means x is tangentially inside z. But if y is inside x and z touches y without overlapping, then z can't completely contain x. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is non-tangentially inside z. Like the above, this isn't compatible with the given constraints.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is tangentially inside x. This is possible if z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is non-tangentially inside x. This is possible if z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Given that z touches y, and y touches the boundary of x, this might seem contradictory. However, z could touch y at a part of y's boundary that is inside x, not at the part where y touches the boundary of x.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same. But if y is tangentially inside x and z touches y at the boundary without overlapping, then z can't be the same as x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think the NTPPi(x,z) case is still a bit unclear. Let's think again. For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. But if z touches y, and y touches the boundary of x, can z be entirely inside x without touching the boundary?

Here's the key insight: y touches the boundary of x at some points, but not at all points of its boundary. z touches y at y's boundary, but it could touch y at a part of y's boundary that is inside x, not at the part where y touches the boundary of x.

So, NTPPi(x,z) is indeed possible.

The possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's double-check each of these to make sure they're consistent with the given constraints.

For NTPPi(x,z), think of x as a big circle, y as a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x, and z as another small circle inside x that touches y but doesn't touch the boundary of x. This arrangement is consistent with TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) and results in NTPPi(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z), imagine a similar setup, but z touches both y and the boundary of x. This is also consistent with the given constraints.

For PO(x,z), imagine z as a circle that overlaps with y and extends both inside and outside of x. This is consistent with the given constraints.

For EC(x,z), imagine z as a circle outside x that touches the boundary of x at the same point where y touches the boundary of x. This is consistent with the given constraints.

So, the answer is: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I overlooked something. We're not told that z touches y at y's boundary; we're told EC(y,z), which means y and z touch at their boundaries. This means they have at least one common boundary point, but they might have more than one common boundary point.

Let's double-check DC(x,z) again. If y is inside x and z touches y's boundary, then DC(x,z) would mean z doesn't touch x. But if y touches the boundary of x, and z touches the boundary of y, it seems like z could be outside x without touching x (i.e., DC(x,z)). But let's think about this more carefully.

If TPPi(x,y), then y is tangentially inside x. This means:
- Every point of y is inside x (y is a proper part of x).
- Some boundary points of y are also boundary points of x.

If EC(y,z), then y and z touch at their boundaries. This means:
- y and z share at least one boundary point.
- y and z don't share any interior points.

Now, the boundary point(s) where y and z touch could be:
1. Boundary points of y that are also boundary points of x.
2. Boundary points of y that are not boundary points of x (i.e., they are inside x).

Let's consider case 1: If y and z touch at a boundary point that is also a boundary point of x, then z would at least touch the boundary of x. In this case, the possible relationships between x and z would be EC(x,z) or PO(x,z).

Let's consider case 2: If y and z touch at a boundary point that is inside x, then z is either inside x or extends both inside and outside of x. In this case, the possible relationships between x and z would be NTPPi(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or PO(x,z).

Since DC(x,z) wasn't possible in either case, it's not a possible relationship between x and z given the constraints.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm a bit confused because the case 1 that I outlined is a bit misleading, so let me think more clearly.

TPPi(x,y) means y is tangentially inside x, which means y is a proper part of x and touches the boundary of x. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

Since y is tangentially inside x, y touches the boundary of x. And since EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries.

Let's consider two cases:

1. If y and z touch at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z and x also touch at that point.
2. If y and z touch at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then this point is inside x, which means z penetrates into x.

For case 1, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x,z) or PO(x,z). DC(x,z) is not possible because x and z touch at least at one point.

For case 2, the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z). DC(x,z) is not possible because z penetrates into x. EC(x,z) is not possible for the same reason.

Combining the two cases, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, when I say "penetrates", I mean that z shares interior points with x.

Let me re-examine the DC(x,z) case more carefully. If y is tangentially inside x, there's a boundary point of y that's also a boundary point of x. If z touches y at a different boundary point (one that's not a boundary point of x), then z doesn't necessarily touch or overlap with x. But is this consistent with the constraints?

If TPPi(x,y), then all points of y are inside x, except for the boundary points of y that are also boundary points of x. If z touches y at a boundary point of y that's not a boundary point of x, then this point is inside x, which means z shares at least one point with x. This contradicts DC(x,z), which requires x and z to be completely separate.

OK, so DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let's re-examine EC(x,z). If y is tangentially inside x, and z touches y at a boundary point of y that's not a boundary point of x, then this point is inside x. This means z penetrates into x, which contradicts EC(x,z), which requires x and z to only touch at their boundaries.

But wait, if y touches the boundary of x, and z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z would also touch the boundary of x. In this case, EC(x,z) is possible.

So, we need to clarify when EC(x,z) is possible and when it isn't, based on where z touches y.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me approach it systematically.

Given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), we want to find the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's consider the different scenarios:

1. If z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x. But z might also extend inside or outside of x, leading to different possibilities.

2. If z touches y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x, then this point is inside x. But z might also extend outside of x, leading to different possibilities.

Let's identify the possible relationships for each scenario:

For scenario 1:
- EC(x,z): z is outside x but touches the boundary of x.
- PO(x,z): z overlaps with x (shares some interior points) but neither is completely inside the other.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches the boundary of x.

For scenario 2:
- PO(x,z): z overlaps with x but extends outside of x.
- TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches the boundary of x (at a different point from where it touches y).
- NTPPi(x,z): z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Combining the two scenarios, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I think I was right before. Let me quickly double-check that DC(x,z) is not a possibility:

If TPPi(x,y), then all points of y are inside x, except for the boundary points of y that are also boundary points of x. If EC(y,z), then y and z touch at their boundaries. If z touches y at a boundary point of y that's not a boundary point of x, then this point is inside x, which means z shares at least one point with x. This contradicts DC(x,z), which requires x and z to be completely separate.

So, DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me also double-check TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z):

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be tangentially inside z. But if y is inside x and z touches y without overlapping y, then z can't completely contain x. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be non-tangentially inside z. Like the above, this isn't compatible with the given constraints.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be the same. But if y is tangentially inside x and z touches y at the boundary without overlapping y, then z can't be the same as x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, let me think about TPP(x,z) in a slightly different way, just to be completely sure. For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be a tangential proper part of z. This means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), I want to check if TPP(x,z) is consistent.

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, then y (which is inside x, given TPPi(x,y)) is also inside z. But EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries without overlapping. If y is inside z, then they must overlap, which contradicts EC(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not consistent with the given constraints.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be inside z without touching z's boundary. Again, this would mean y (which is inside x) is also inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

And for EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be the same. If they are the same, then y (which is inside x) would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Final answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), I'll analyze the constraints systematically:

- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points)

Let me consider what these constraints allow:

1. EC(x,z): This is possible if z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, z would be outside x but touching x's boundary.

2. PO(x,z): This is possible if z extends both inside and outside of x. Z could touch y at y's boundary and partially overlap with x.

3. TPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Z could touch y at a boundary point and also touch the boundary of x elsewhere.

4. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible if z is entirely inside x without touching x's boundary. Z could touch y at a boundary point of y that's inside x, not at the point where y touches x's boundary.

Other RCC-8 relations are impossible: DC(x,z) is impossible because z must share at least one point with x; TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because they would require y to overlap with z, contradicting EC(y,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
