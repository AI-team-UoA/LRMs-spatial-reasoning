PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's use the definitions of the RCC-8 relations to work through this problem step by step.

We're given that:
- TPPi(x,y): This means TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is entirely contained within x, and touches x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is entirely contained within y, and touches y's boundary.

We need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Given TPP(y,x) and TPP(z,y), we know:
1. y is properly contained in x
2. y touches the boundary of x
3. z is properly contained in y
4. z touches the boundary of y

Since z is properly contained in y, and y is properly contained in x, we can infer that z is properly contained in x (by transitivity of containment). So z is either a tangential proper part of x (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP).

The key question is: Does z touch the boundary of x?

Since z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, it's possible that z touches the boundary of x at the same point where y touches the boundary of x. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x (TPP).

However, it's also possible that z touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of x. In this case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP).

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- TPP(z,x), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z)
- NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check this by considering a concrete example:

Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x from the inside, and z is an even smaller circle that touches the boundary of y.

If z touches the boundary of y at the same point where y touches the boundary of x, then z also touches the boundary of x, making TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z) hold.

If z touches the boundary of y at a different point, one that's inside x (not on x's boundary), then z doesn't touch the boundary of x, making NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z) hold.

Actually, I want to be very precise about this. Let's consider the 8 RCC relations and systematically rule them out or confirm them:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because z is contained within y, which is contained within x.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z externally connect (touch at their boundaries). This is impossible because z is properly contained within y, which is properly contained within x, so z cannot touch the boundary of x from the outside.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is impossible because z is properly contained within y, which is properly contained within x, so z is properly contained within x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is impossible because z is properly contained within y, which is properly contained within x, so x cannot be a proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is impossible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is impossible because z is properly contained within y, which is properly contained within x, so z cannot be equal to x.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me re-examine my reasoning more carefully, especially about when z touches the boundary of x.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

Does z necessarily touch the boundary of x? Not necessarily.

Does z necessarily not touch the boundary of x? Also not necessarily.

The key is to understand that z touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of x, but this doesn't guarantee that z touches the boundary of x.

For z to touch the boundary of x, z needs to touch y's boundary at the exact point where y touches x's boundary. This is possible but not necessary. It's also possible that z touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch x's boundary.

Let's again consider the example of nested circles:
- x is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at a point.
- z is an even smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at a point.

If z touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary, then z also touches x's boundary, making TPPi(x,z) hold.

If z touches y's boundary at a different point, one that's inside x (not on x's boundary), then z doesn't touch the boundary of x, making NTPPi(x,z) hold.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me be crystal clear.

Given: 
- TPPi(x,y): This means TPP(y,x).
- TPPi(y,z): This means TPP(z,y).

So y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y.

This means:
- y is entirely contained within x, and touches x's boundary.
- z is entirely contained within y, and touches y's boundary.

Since z is entirely contained within y, and y is entirely contained within x, z is also entirely contained within x.

The question is: Does z touch the boundary of x?

If z touches the boundary of x, then z is a tangential proper part of x, making TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z) hold.

If z doesn't touch the boundary of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, making NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z) hold.

Under what conditions would z touch the boundary of x? It would need to touch y's boundary at the exact point where y touches x's boundary. This is possible but not guaranteed. So both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible relations between x and z.

Actually, I think I've been somewhat unclear in my reasoning. Let me try again. Let's use the formal definitions of the RCC-8 relations:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is properly contained in y and x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is properly contained in y and x does not touch the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), meaning TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y) is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), meaning NTPP(y,x).

Given:
- TPPi(x,y): This means y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So:
- y is properly contained in x and touches the boundary of x.
- z is properly contained in y and touches the boundary of y.

Let's consider a concrete scenario to analyze this problem. Picture:
- x as a circle that contains y
- y as a smaller circle that touches the boundary of x at point p_xy
- z as an even smaller circle that touches the boundary of y at point p_yz

Now, consider two cases:

1. If p_yz is the same as p_xy, then z also touches the boundary of x at this point. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z) holds.

2. If p_yz is different from p_xy (i.e., z touches y's boundary at a point that's inside x, not on x's boundary), then z doesn't touch the boundary of x. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z) holds.

Both of these cases are possible, so the possible relations between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Ok, so the answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how x and z relate given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me translate these relations:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is contained in x and touches x's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained in y and touches y's boundary)

Since z is contained in y, and y is contained in x, we know z is contained in x.

The key question is: Does z touch x's boundary?

Two scenarios are possible:
1. z touches y's boundary at the exact point where y touches x's boundary. In this case, z also touches x's boundary, making z a tangential proper part of x → TPPi(x,z)

2. z touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch x's boundary. In this case, z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, making z a non-tangential proper part of x → NTPPi(x,z)

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
