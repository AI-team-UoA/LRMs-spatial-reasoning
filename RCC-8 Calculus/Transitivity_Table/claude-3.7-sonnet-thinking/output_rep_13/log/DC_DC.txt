PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step. 

We know that:
- DC(x,y) means x and y are disconnected (they don't share any spatial parts)
- DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected (they don't share any spatial parts)

Now we need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Given that x is disconnected from y, and y is disconnected from z, x and z could have any spatial relationship with each other. Let me check each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected from each other. This is certainly possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z could be externally connected (touching at their boundaries). This is possible because even though x doesn't overlap with y and y doesn't overlap with z, x and z could still touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap. This is possible because x and z could share space even if neither shares space with y.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). This is possible because x can be inside z while both remain disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (x is completely inside z). This is possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). This is possible because z can be inside x while both remain disconnected from y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (z is completely inside x). This is possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal (exactly the same region). This is possible because x and z can be the same region while both remain disconnected from y.

So it seems that given only DC(x,y) and DC(y,z), all eight RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z. This makes sense because if y is disconnected from both x and z, that doesn't constrain the relationship between x and z in any way.

Let me double-check my reasoning with a few examples:

Example 1: Imagine three circles where x and z overlap but y is separate from both. This gives us DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

Example 2: Imagine three circles where x is inside z, but y is separate from both. This gives us DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Example 3: Imagine three identical circles where x and z are the same circle, but y is separate. This gives us DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and EQ(x,z).

All of these examples are consistent with the constraints, confirming that all eight relations are possible between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z when DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Which is all of the RCC-8 relations.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. I need to be sure that the constraints DC(x,y) and DC(y,z) don't rule out any of the eight possible relations between x and z.

Let me try to construct a specific spatial scenario for each of the eight possible relations between x and z, while maintaining DC(x,y) and DC(y,z):

1. DC(x,z): Imagine three separate circles, none overlapping. This clearly satisfies all constraints.

2. EC(x,z): Imagine x and z as two circles that touch at their boundaries, and y as a separate circle. This satisfies DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): Imagine x and z as two overlapping circles, and y as a separate circle. This satisfies DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and PO(x,z).

4. TPP(x,z): Imagine x as a circle inside z, touching z's boundary, and y as a separate circle. This satisfies DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Imagine x as a circle completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), and y as a separate circle. This satisfies DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and NTPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Imagine z as a circle inside x, touching x's boundary, and y as a separate circle. This satisfies DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and TPPi(x,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Imagine z as a circle completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y as a separate circle. This satisfies DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Imagine x and z as identical circles, and y as a separate circle. This satisfies DC(x,y), DC(y,z), and EQ(x,z).

So all eight RCC-8 relations between x and z are indeed possible given DC(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Therefore, the answer is: All RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, namely:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given that x is disconnected from y and y is disconnected from z.

When two regions are disconnected from a third region, they themselves can have any possible spatial relationship with each other. This is because the disconnection from y doesn't constrain how x and z relate to each other at all.

Let me verify this by considering each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be completely separate regions
2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries
3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap
4. TPP(x,z): x can be a tangential proper part of z
5. NTPP(x,z): x can be a non-tangential proper part of z
6. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x
7. NTPPi(x,z): z can be a non-tangential proper part of x
8. EQ(x,z): x and z can be identical regions

In each case, both x and z can remain disconnected from y.

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), EQ(x,z)
