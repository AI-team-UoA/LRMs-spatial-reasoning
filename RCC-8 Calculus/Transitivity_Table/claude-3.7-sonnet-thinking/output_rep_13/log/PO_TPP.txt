PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to consider what happens when PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) hold, and determine the possible relationships between x and z.

PO(x,y) means that x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely contained in z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z.

Since PO(x,y), x has some part that overlaps with y, and some part that is outside of y.

Since TPP(y,z), all of y is contained in z, and y touches the boundary of z.

For the part of x that overlaps with y, that part must be contained in z (since y is contained in z).

For the part of x that is outside of y, it could be:
1. Completely outside of z
2. Partially inside z
3. Completely inside z

Let's consider each case:

1. If the part of x that is outside of y is completely outside of z, then x and z would be disconnected (DC) or externally connected (EC). But this is impossible because we know that part of x (the part that overlaps with y) is inside z. So we can rule out DC(x,z).

2. If the part of x that is outside of y is partially inside z, then x and z would partially overlap (PO).

3. If the part of x that is outside of y is completely inside z, and given that the part of x that overlaps with y is also inside z, then all of x would be inside z. This would mean either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z), depending on whether x touches the boundary of z.

So, our possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I missed EC(x,z). Let me think more carefully.

If PO(x,y), then x has some part that overlaps with y, and some part that is outside of y.

If TPP(y,z), then all of y is contained in z, and y touches the boundary of z.

For the part of x that overlaps with y, it must be inside z since y is inside z.

Now, for the part of x that is outside of y, there are a few cases:

1. It could be completely outside of z, in which case x and z would be EC (externally connected). This is because part of x (the part that overlaps with y) is inside z, and part of x is outside of z, and the two regions must be connected because x is a connected region.

Wait, I'm making an assumption that x is a connected region, which might not be stated in the problem. But generally in RCC-8, regions are assumed to be connected. Let me reconsider.

If the part of x that is outside of y is completely outside of z, then x and z share a part (the part of x that overlaps with y is inside z), but they are not properly contained in each other. This would be PO(x,z).

2. If the part of x that is outside of y is partially inside z and partially outside z, then again, x and z would partially overlap (PO).

3. If the part of x that is outside of y is completely inside z, then all of x would be inside z. This would mean either TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z), depending on whether x touches the boundary of z.

Actually, I'm getting confused in my reasoning. Let me try a more systematic approach.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z and touches z's boundary).

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's consider the possible configurations:

1. Part of x is inside y (because PO(x,y)).
2. Part of x is outside y (because PO(x,y)).
3. All of y is inside z (because TPP(y,z)).
4. y touches the boundary of z (because TPP(y,z)).

From 1 and 3, we know that part of x is inside z (the part that is inside y).

From 2, the part of x that is outside y could be inside z, outside z, or partially inside and partially outside z.

So, x and z could be related in the following ways:

- If all of x is inside z and x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z).
- If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z).
- If part of x is inside z and part is outside z, then PO(x,z).
- If x and z only touch at the boundary without sharing interior parts, then EC(x,z).

Wait, can EC(x,z) actually happen? Let's see:

For EC(x,z) to hold, x and z must touch at the boundary without sharing interior parts. But we know that part of x is inside y, and all of y is inside z. This means that part of x is inside z, which contradicts the definition of EC. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Let's reconsider the case where the part of x outside of y is completely outside of z.

If part of x is inside y (from PO(x,y)), and all of y is inside z (from TPP(y,z)), then part of x is inside z. If the rest of x is outside of z, then x and z would partially overlap, which is PO(x,z).

Actually, wait. I need to be careful. It is possible to have EC(x,z). Here's how it might happen.

Imagine a situation where:
- y is a tangential proper part of z, touching the boundary of z.
- x and y partially overlap.
- The part of x that overlaps with y is the only part of x that is inside z.
- The overlap of x and y is only at the boundary of z.

In this case, x and z would only touch at the boundary, which would be EC(x,z).

Actually, hmm. I now realize that's still not possible! Because TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z. So if part of x is inside y, then that part is inside z, not on the boundary of z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

So let's systematically work through all options.

Given that PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z):

- DC(x,z): Not possible. We know that part of x is inside z (the part that is inside y), so x and z cannot be disconnected.

- EC(x,z): Not possible. As we just discussed, part of x is inside z, so x and z cannot be externally connected.

- PO(x,z): Possible. If part of x is inside z (the part that is inside y) and part of x is outside z, then x and z partially overlap.

- TPP(x,z): Possible. If all of x is inside z and x touches the boundary of z, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

- NTPP(x,z): Possible. If all of x is inside z and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

- TPPi(x,z): Not possible. This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x, which is not possible since part of x is inside z and not the other way around.

- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Similar to TPPi, this would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is not possible.

- EQ(x,z): Not possible. This would mean x and z are identical, which is not consistent with the given conditions.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But let me check my reasoning once more.

Actually, there's a subtle case I missed. What if x extends beyond the boundary of z but still overlaps with y inside z? This would still be consistent with PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z). In this case, the relationship between x and z would be PO(x,z).

So, after a more thorough analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

That's our final answer.

Actually, now that I think about it, let me be even more systematic and consider each of the 8 possible relationships and check each one:

1. DC(x,z): Disconnected. This means x and z share no spatial parts.
   Given: PO(x,y) means x and y share a spatial part, and TPP(y,z) means y is completely contained in z.
   Since x and y share a part, and y is contained in z, there's a part of x that's inside z. This contradicts DC(x,z).
   So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): Externally connected. This means x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
   Given: PO(x,y) means x and y share interior parts, and TPP(y,z) means y is completely contained in z.
   Since x and y share interior parts, and y is contained in z, there's an interior part of x that's inside z. This contradicts EC(x,z).
   So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): Partially overlapping. This means x and z share a spatial part, but neither is contained in the other.
   Scenario: x has a part inside y (which is inside z) and a part outside of z.
   This is consistent with the given conditions.
   So, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Tangential proper part. This means x is contained in z and touches z's boundary.
   Scenario: x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z. This is consistent with the given conditions, especially if x extends to the boundary of z (which is possible since y touches the boundary of z).
   So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Non-tangential proper part. This means x is contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
   Scenario: x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is consistent with the given conditions, especially if x is contained within the interior of z.
   So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Inverse of TPP. This means z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Given: TPP(y,z) means y is contained in z, and PO(x,y) means x and y share a part.
   For z to be a proper part of x, all of z would have to be inside x. But this would imply that all of y is inside x (since y is inside z), which contradicts PO(x,y).
   So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Inverse of NTPP. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPPi, this would imply that all of y is inside x, contradicting PO(x,y).
   So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Equal. This means x and z are the same region.
   Given: TPP(y,z) means y is a proper part of z, and PO(x,y) means x and y share a part.
   If x and z are the same, then PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would become PO(x,y) and TPP(y,x), which is a contradiction because y can't be both a proper part of x and partially overlapping with x.
   So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I'm confident this is the correct answer.

Actually, wait. I need to double-check my reasoning for TPPi(x,z). Let's consider TPPi(x,z) more carefully.

TPPi(x,z) means z is a tangential proper part of x, or equivalently, TPP(z,x).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z would have to be completely inside x and touch the boundary of x.

But we know that y is a proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)). This means that y is completely inside z.

Now, for x and y to partially overlap (PO(x,y)), there must be a part of y that's outside of x. But if z is completely inside x, and y is completely inside z, then y would be completely inside x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me do the same for NTPPi(x,z):

NTPPi(x,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or equivalently, NTPP(z,x).

For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z would have to be completely inside x and not touch the boundary of x.

Again, if z is completely inside x, and y is completely inside z, then y would be completely inside x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double check PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z):

For PO(x,z), we need x and z to share a part, but neither should be contained in the other.

Scenario: A part of x is inside y (which is inside z) and another part of x is outside of z. This satisfies PO(x,z) because part of x is inside z and part is outside, and neither x nor z is contained in the other.

For TPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z and touch the boundary of z.

Scenario: All of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z. This is consistent with PO(x,y) if x extends beyond y but still remains inside z, and touches the boundary of z.

For NTPP(x,z), we need x to be completely inside z and not touch the boundary of z.

Scenario: All of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is consistent with PO(x,y) if x extends beyond y but still remains inside z, and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Let me also double check DC(x,z) and EC(x,z):

For DC(x,z), x and z must be disconnected. But since part of x is inside y (from PO(x,y)), and all of y is inside z (from TPP(y,z)), there's a part of x that's inside z. This contradicts DC(x,z).

For EC(x,z), x and z must touch at the boundary without sharing interior points. But again, since part of x is inside y and all of y is inside z, there's a part of x that's inside z. This contradicts EC(x,z).

So, our final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I'm now second-guessing myself on TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z). Let me think about it more carefully.

For TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x must be inside z, and x must touch the boundary of z.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

For all of x to be inside z, the part of x that doesn't overlap with y must also be inside z. This is certainly possible.

Now, for x to touch the boundary of z, it must extend to the boundary of z. Since y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)), if x extends to the same point on the boundary of z, then x would also touch the boundary of z. This is consistent with the given conditions.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to hold, all of x must be inside z, and x must not touch the boundary of z.

Again, all of x being inside z is possible. And if x doesn't extend to the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) would hold.

So, NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, before I answer, let me double check one more time. We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

For PO(x,z), we need:
- x and z share some parts.
- Some parts of x are outside of z.
- Some parts of z are outside of x.

It's clear that x and z share some parts because x shares parts with y, and y is contained in z. It's also clear that parts of z can be outside of x (since y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y). 

For the second condition, it's not immediately clear that x must have parts outside of z. Could x be entirely contained in z? Let's think about this. x and y partially overlap, which means there are parts of x that are outside of y. These parts of x could either be inside z or outside z.

If these parts of x are inside z, then all of x would be inside z, which would make x a proper part of z (either TPP or NTPP). If these parts of x are outside z, then x would partially overlap with z.

So, PO(x,z) is possible if the parts of x that are outside of y are also outside of z.

For TPP(x,z), we need:
- All of x is inside z.
- x touches the boundary of z.

As we discussed, all of x being inside z is possible. And since y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)), if x extends to the same point on the boundary of z, then x would also touch the boundary of z.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), we need:
- All of x is inside z.
- x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Again, all of x being inside z is possible. And if x doesn't extend to the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) would hold.

So, NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

Let's check the remaining relations:

For DC(x,z), x and z must be disconnected. But since x shares parts with y, and y is contained in z, x and z share parts. This contradicts DC(x,z).

For EC(x,z), x and z must touch at the boundary without sharing interior points. But since x shares interior points with y, and y is contained in z, x and z share interior points. This contradicts EC(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z), z must be a tangential proper part of x. This means all of z is inside x, which would imply all of y is inside x (since y is inside z). But this contradicts PO(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z), z must be a non-tangential proper part of x. Again, this would imply all of y is inside x, contradicting PO(x,y).

For EQ(x,z), x and z must be identical. This would imply that y is a tangential proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x,y).

So, after a thorough check, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This is our final answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z when we know PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap (share some parts, but neither is contained in the other)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since x overlaps with y, and y is contained in z, some part of x must be inside z.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as above, x and z must share interior points, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x has parts inside z (the parts that overlap with y) and also parts outside z, this creates a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. All of x could be contained within z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. All of x could be contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. This would mean z is contained in x, but since y is inside z and only partially overlaps with x, z cannot be contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would have to be both a tangential proper part of x and partially overlapping with x, which is contradictory.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
