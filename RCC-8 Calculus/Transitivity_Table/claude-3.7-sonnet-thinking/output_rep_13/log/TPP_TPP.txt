PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this carefully.

We're given two relations:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's think through the different possibilities.

Since x is part of y (TPP(x,y)), and y is part of z (TPP(y,z)), it follows that x is also part of z by the transitivity of the part-of relation. So x must be either a tangential proper part (TPP) or a non-tangential proper part (NTPP) of z. Let's figure out which one(s) is possible.

For x to be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)), x must touch the boundary of z. Since TPP(x,y), x touches the boundary of y. And since TPP(y,z), y touches the boundary of z. But this doesn't necessarily mean that x touches the boundary of z. It could be that the part of x that touches y's boundary is inside y, and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For example, imagine three concentric circles: the innermost is x, the middle one is y, and the outermost is z. Here, x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z. In this case, we'd have NTPP(x,z).

But it's also possible for x to touch the boundary of z. For example, imagine a scenario where z is a disk, y is a smaller disk contained within z and touching z's boundary at one point, and x is an even smaller disk contained within y and touching both y's boundary and z's boundary at the same point. In this case, we'd have TPP(x,z).

So both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z.

Let's check if any other relationships are possible.

Could x be disconnected from z (DC(x,z))? No, because x is part of y, and y is part of z, so x must be part of z.

Could x externally connect with z (EC(x,z))? No, for the same reason: x must be part of z, so it can't merely externally connect with z.

Could x partially overlap with z (PO(x,z))? No, again for the same reason: x must be fully contained within z, not just partially overlapping with it.

Could z be a part of x (TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z))? No, because we've established that x is a part of z, and since these relations are proper part relations, x and z cannot be the same (they are not equal).

Could x be equal to z (EQ(x,z))? No, because if x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, then x and z cannot be the same.

So the only possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

1. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x touches the boundary of z.
2. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

I believe these are the only possible relationships. 

So if TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me just make sure that my reasoning is correct by considering a few examples:

Example 1: Three concentric circles, where each touches the next one at a single point.
- Here, TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would hold.
- x would touch the boundary of z, so TPP(x,z) would hold.

Example 2: Three concentric circles, where the innermost doesn't touch the outermost.
- Here, TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) would hold.
- x would not touch the boundary of z, so NTPP(x,z) would hold.

These examples confirm that both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible.

So, the answer is that if TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given that TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

Since x is part of y, and y is part of z, x must be part of z. This immediately eliminates DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ as possible relations.

So x must be either a tangential proper part (TPP) or non-tangential proper part (NTPP) of z:

1. TPP(x,z): This occurs when x touches the boundary of z (e.g., when x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary)

2. NTPP(x,z): This occurs when x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (e.g., when x touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch z's boundary)

Both scenarios are geometrically possible.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
