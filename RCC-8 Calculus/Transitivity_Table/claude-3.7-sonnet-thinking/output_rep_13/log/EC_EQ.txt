PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think about this step by step.

We have two given relations:
1. EC(x,y) - x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts
2. EQ(y,z) - y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), this means that y and z are exactly the same spatial region. They have the same interior points and the same boundary points. This means that any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that EC(x,y), and y is equivalent to z, then x must also be externally connected to z.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by going through the formal properties.

If EC(x,y), then:
- x and y share boundary points but no interior points
- x and y are connected but don't overlap

If EQ(y,z), then:
- y and z have exactly the same interior points
- y and z have exactly the same boundary points

Therefore, for x and z:
- x shares boundary points with y (from EC(x,y))
- z has the same boundary points as y (from EQ(y,z))
- Therefore, x shares boundary points with z

- x shares no interior points with y (from EC(x,y))
- z has the same interior points as y (from EQ(y,z))
- Therefore, x shares no interior points with z

So x and z are connected at their boundaries but don't share interior points, which is the definition of EC.

Therefore, the answer is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relations can hold between x and z given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (exactly the same region)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are identical regions with the same boundaries and interior, any spatial relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Given that x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), and z is identical to y, then x must also be externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
