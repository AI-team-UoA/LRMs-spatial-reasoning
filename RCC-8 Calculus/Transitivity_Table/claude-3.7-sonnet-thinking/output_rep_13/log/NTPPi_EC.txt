PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step:

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that y is completely inside x (i.e., y is contained in x's interior) and does not touch x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. This means that y and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors do not overlap.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's analyze the situation:
- y is completely inside x (i.e., y is contained in x's interior).
- z touches y at y's boundary.

Since y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary, and z touches y at y's boundary, z must at least intersect with x's interior (because it touches y, which is entirely within x's interior).

But what's the complete set of possible relations between x and z?

Let's consider each RCC8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is not possible. Since z touches y, which is entirely inside x, z must at least touch x as well.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
   This might be possible if z touches y at y's boundary, and z also touches x at x's boundary. But wait, y is entirely in x's interior, so y's boundary is also in x's interior. Therefore, if z touches y at y's boundary, z must intersect with x's interior. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. z touches y at y's boundary, which is within x's interior. z can extend both inside and outside of x, leading to partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This might be possible if z completely covers x and also extends beyond it, with x touching z's boundary.
   Hmm, but if y is entirely inside x (NTPP), and z only touches y at the boundary, then z can't completely cover x. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is not possible for the same reasoning as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. z touches y at y's boundary, which means z has some part within x. If z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) holds.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) holds.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This is not possible. Since z touches y at y's boundary, and y is entirely inside x, z cannot be identical to x.

Actually, I think there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again about the situation:

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected.

Actually, let's flip NTPPi(x,y) to the more intuitive NTPP(y,x), which means the same thing. So we have:
- NTPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries.

Since y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary, and z touches y at the boundary, z must at least partially intersect with x's interior. 

Let's go through the RCC8 relations again:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is not possible. Since z touches y, which is entirely inside x, z must at least touch x as well.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
   As I reasoned earlier, this is not possible because z touches y at y's boundary, which is within x's interior. So z must intersect with x's interior and not just at x's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. z touches y at y's boundary, which is inside x. z can then extend outside of x, resulting in a partial overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is not possible. For x to be a proper part of z, z would need to completely cover x and extend beyond it. But if y is entirely inside x (NTPP) and z only touches y at the boundary, z can't completely cover x.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is also not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. If z touches y at y's boundary and is entirely contained within x, with z also touching x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) holds.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is also possible. If z touches y at y's boundary and is entirely contained within x, but does not touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) holds.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This is not possible. Since z touches y at y's boundary, and y is entirely inside x, z cannot be identical to x.

Let me just double check a few:

Actually, let me try to be more precise in my reasoning by clarifying what the relations mean.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x's interior, not touching x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means that y's boundary overlaps with z's boundary, but their interiors do not overlap.

Now, let's imagine the spatial configuration:
- We have a region x.
- Fully inside x, not touching x's boundary, is the region y.
- The region z touches y's boundary but has no interior overlap with y.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is not possible. Since z touches y, which is inside x, z must have some spatial relationship with x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
   I initially thought this was not possible, but let me reconsider. If z touches y at y's boundary, which is inside x's interior, z must intersect with x's interior. This means that z cannot just touch x at its boundary; it must have some interior overlap with x. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. If a part of z extends outside of x, while another part of z is inside x, then they partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is not possible. For x to be a proper part of z, z would need to completely cover x. Since y is inside x and z only touches y at y's boundary, z cannot completely cover x.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is also not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary, while also touching y's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) holds.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is also possible. If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, but touches y's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) holds.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This is not possible. Since z touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside x, z cannot be identical to x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, actually, let me go through the logic one more time. I want to be very precise about the relations I'm considering.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means that y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Alternatively, x properly contains y and y doesn't touch x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, which means that they touch at their boundaries but their interiors do not overlap.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   This is not possible. Since z touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside x, z must have some part inside x. So they cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries.
   Let's think about this carefully. If z touches y at y's boundary, z must have some part inside x. But can z touch x's boundary as well? If z were to touch x's boundary, then z would need to extend from y's boundary to x's boundary. This is possible, and in this case, x and z would be externally connected. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible. If z touches y at y's boundary, which is inside x, z has some part inside x. If z also extends outside of x, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, z would need to completely cover x and extend beyond it, with x touching z's boundary. But since y is entirely inside x, and z only touches y at y's boundary, z can't cover all of x. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible. If z touches y at y's boundary and is entirely contained within x, with z also touching x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) holds.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is also possible. If z touches y at y's boundary and is entirely contained within x, but does not touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) holds.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This is not possible. Since z touches y at y's boundary, and y is inside x, z cannot be identical to x.

Hold on, I'm actually not sure if EC(x,z) is possible. Let me clarify the definition of external connection again. 

EC(a,b) means that a and b touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap. 

So for EC(x,z), x and z would touch at their boundaries without their interiors overlapping. 

But we know that z touches y at y's boundary, and y is fully inside x. This means that z touches a point inside x, which implies that z and x have some interior overlap. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's step back and try to visualize these relationships.

Let's say we have a region x, and inside x (not touching x's boundary) is the region y. Now, z touches y at the boundary of y. What are the possible ways that z can relate to x?

1. z could be entirely inside x, touching y but not touching x's boundary. This would mean NTPPi(x,z).
2. z could be entirely inside x, touching y and touching x's boundary. This would mean TPPi(x,z).
3. z could partially be inside x (touching y) and partially outside x. This would mean PO(x,z).
4. Can z be completely outside x? No, because z touches y, which is inside x, so z must have at least some overlap with x.

So, I believe that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But I'm not 100% sure about PO(x,z). The reason is that we know y is inside x, but we also know that z only touches y at y's boundary. Could z be mostly outside x, just touching y at the boundary? If that's the case, then PO(x,z) is possible.

Actually, no, I think PO(x,z) is definitely possible. Here's a simple example: Imagine x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle inside x, and z is a shape that touches y's boundary but extends outside of x. In this case, x and z would partially overlap.

Let me revisit EC(x,z) again. EC(x,z) would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap. Given our constraints, this would mean that z touches y (which is inside x) and also touches x's boundary, but doesn't go inside x at all. Is this possible?

Actually, no, it's not possible. Since z touches y, which is inside x, z must have some overlap with x's interior. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

But wait, let me reconsider this. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't have interior overlap. So z touches y at y's boundary.

Now, imagine x is a big circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a shape that just touches y's boundary at a single point. This point is inside x. Could z extend outside of x and only touch x's boundary? If so, x and z would have their boundaries touching but no interior overlap, which would make them externally connected.

Hmm, actually, I think my confusion stems from not being precise about what "touching" means. Let's clarify: if two regions "touch," it means that their boundaries have a non-empty intersection, but their interiors do not overlap.

Given that, EC(y,z) means that the boundaries of y and z intersect, but the interiors don't. The intersection of their boundaries is inside x's interior (because y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary). This means that z intersects with x's interior, which means that x and z have interior overlap. So, x and z cannot be just externally connected; they must have a more "involved" relationship.

Let me try again with a different perspective. 

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x, and y does not touch x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.

Now, z touches y at y's boundary, and y's boundary is entirely inside x's interior. This means that z has at least one point inside x. Let's consider what the rest of z might be like:

1. If z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) holds.
2. If z is entirely inside x and touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) holds.
3. If z has parts both inside and outside x, then PO(x,z) holds.

The question is: Can z be related to x in any other way, given the constraints?

For DC(x,z), x and z would be disconnected. But since z touches y, which is inside x, z and x must have some spatial relationship. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), x and z would touch at their boundaries without interior overlap. But since z touches y's boundary, which is inside x, z must have some overlap with x's interior. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a tangential proper part of z, meaning z completely covers x and extends beyond, with x touching z's boundary. But if y is inside x and z only touches y at y's boundary, z can't cover all of x. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be a non-tangential proper part of z, which is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be equal. But this contradicts the fact that z touches y at y's boundary, which is inside x. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, I believe that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Upon closer inspection, I realized that I need to be careful about what it means for regions to "touch." In the RCC-8, if two regions touch, it means they share some boundary points, but there's no interior-to-interior overlap.

I realize there is a very precise definition of the RCC-8 relations. 
- DC(a,b) means that there is no spatial overlap at all between a and b.
- EC(a,b) means that a and b share boundary points (they "touch" each other), but there are no points that are part of both a's interior and b's interior.
- PO(a,b) means that there are points that are part of both a's interior and b's interior, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(a,b) means that a is a proper part of b, and a shares some boundary points with b.
- NTPP(a,b) means that a is a proper part of b, and there are no points in a that are also in b's boundary.
- TPPi(a,b) means the same as TPP(b,a).
- NTPPi(a,b) means the same as NTPP(b,a).
- EQ(a,b) means that a and b are the exact same region.

Now, for our case, we have NTPPi(x,y), which means that y is properly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries.

Since y is inside x, and z touches y, z must have some relation with x. It can't be DC(x,z) because z touches a region inside x, so it must have some spatial relation with x. But what relation?

Let's consider EC(x,z). Would it be possible for z to touch x at x's boundary, while also touching y inside x, without having any interior-to-interior overlap with x?

Actually, I think EC(x,z) is not possible. If z touches y, which is inside x, then z must overlap with x's interior. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are also not possible because they would require z to completely cover x, which isn't the case given our constraints.

EQ(x,z) is not possible because y is inside x, and z touches y, so z and x can't be identical.

So, the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z): If z touches y inside x and also extends outside of x.
- TPPi(x,z): If z touches y inside x, is entirely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): If z touches y inside x, is entirely contained within x, and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Let's be absolutely sure and double-check if these are the only possible relations.

I'm quite confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hold on, actually let me reason through it again for clarity:

Let's say x is a large circle. Inside this large circle, there's a smaller circle y that doesn't touch the boundary of the large circle. Now, z is a region that touches the boundary of y. What are the possible ways z can relate to x?

1. z could be a region entirely inside x, not touching the boundary of x. This would mean NTPPi(x,z).
2. z could be a region entirely inside x, touching the boundary of x. This would mean TPPi(x,z).
3. z could be a region that extends both inside and outside of x. This would mean PO(x,z).

But could z be completely outside of x? No, because z touches y, which is inside x, so z must have some overlap with x.

Could z be a region that just touches the boundary of x from the outside without going inside x? No, because z touches y, which is inside x. So z must have some part inside x.

Could x be inside z? No, because y is inside x, and z only touches y at y's boundary. So z doesn't cover all of x.

So, I believe that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

And I'm confident that these are the only three possible relations. Let me now also include a simple diagram to illustrate each of these:

For NTPPi(x,z):
```

     |    z    |     |

Hmm, I forgot that the boundaries of y and z should actually touch in these diagrams. Let me try again:

For NTPPi(x,z):
```

     |    z    |     |
     +---------+     |
```

Ok, so going back to our original question:

If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

We've determined that the possible relationships are:
- PO(x,z) - Partial overlap
- TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x
- NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x

Let me see if there are any other relationships I'm missing. Are there any other possibilities for how x and z could be related, given the constraints?

One could argue that if z is extremely small and just touches y at a single point on y's boundary, and this point is inside x, then z could still be DC(x,z) or disconnected from x. But that's not possible in the standard RCC-8 framework, where regions are supposed to be regular closed sets. In such a framework, if z touches a point inside x, then z and x must have some overlap.

So, I believe my final answer is correct. The possible relationships between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me just double check this. I said "if z touches a point inside x, then z and x must have some overlap." But that's not quite right. In RCC-8, "overlap" means having a common part, but "touching" just means having a common boundary point. So if z just touches a point inside x, it doesn't necessarily mean that z and x overlap. But, in our case, z touches y, which is inside x. This means that z has at least a boundary point inside x, which means that z and x have a common part. So, my reasoning stands.

Let's now be absolutely precise in our reasoning:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x's interior. This means that the closure of y is contained in the interior of x. (I'm using closure and interior in the topological sense.)

2. EC(y,z) means that y and z share some boundary points, but their interiors don't intersect.

Now, given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

First, since y is inside x and z touches y, z must have at least a part inside x or touching a part of x. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), x and z would touch at their boundaries without interior overlap. But since z touches y, which is inside x, z must have some part inside x. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z), x and z would have partial overlap. This is possible if z touches y inside x and also extends outside of x.

For TPP(x,z), x would be a tangential proper part of z. This would mean that z completely covers x and extends beyond, with x touching z's boundary. But if y is inside x and z only touches y, z can't cover all of x. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be a non-tangential proper part of z, which is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

For TPPi(x,z), z would be a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z touches y inside x, is entirely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z touches y inside x, is entirely contained within x, and doesn't touch x's boundary.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be equal. But this is not possible because y is inside x, and z touches y, so z and x can't be identical.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, am I sure about PO(x,z)? PO(x,z) means that there's a region common to both x and z, but neither is contained in the other.

Wait, I'm not sure that was fully right. Let's think through the PO(x,z) case again.

For PO(x,z), x and z would have some overlap, but neither would be a proper part of the other. 

If y is inside x, and z touches y at y's boundary, then z has at least a point inside x. If z extends outside of x, then some parts of z are inside x, and some parts are outside. This satisfies the definition of PO(x,z).

Actually, let me go back to basics and think about what NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) actually mean:

- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x's interior (i.e., y does not touch x's boundary).
- EC(y,z) means that y and z share boundary points, but their interiors don't intersect.

Now, let's reason through the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is not possible because z shares boundary points with y, which is inside x. So z must intersect with x to some extent.

2. EC(x,z): For this to be true, x and z would touch at their boundaries without interior overlap. But since y is inside x and z touches y, z must have some part inside x, which means z and x have interior overlap. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means that some parts of x are inside z, and some parts of z are inside x, but neither is fully contained in the other. This is possible. For instance, z could touch y inside x, extend to x's boundary, and also extend outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This means that x is a proper part of z, and x touches z's boundary. For this to be true, z would need to completely cover x. But given that y is inside x, and z only touches y, z can't cover all of x. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means that x is a proper part of z, and x does not touch z's boundary. This is also not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): This means that z is a proper part of x, and z touches x's boundary. This is possible. z could touch y inside x, be fully contained within x, and also touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means that z is a proper part of x, and z does not touch x's boundary. This is also possible. z could touch y inside x, be fully contained within x, and not touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): This means that x and z are the same region. But this is not possible because y is inside x, and z touches y, so z and x can't be identical.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I think I've been entirely over-complicating this. Let's just get back to the basics. 

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x, and y is not touching x's boundary. That means that y is fully inside x, without touching x's boundary.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but have no interior overlap.

So we have y is fully inside x, and z touches the boundary of y. What are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible, because z touches y, which is inside x. So z must have some contact with x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This is not possible. Since y is inside x, y's boundary is inside x. Since z touches y's boundary, z must have some overlap with the interior of x. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible. If z extends from y's boundary (which is inside x) to outside of x, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean that z completely covers x and extends beyond, with x touching z's boundary. But if y is inside x, and z only touches y, z can't cover all of x. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means that z is fully inside x, and z touches x's boundary. This is possible. z could touch y's boundary, be fully inside x, and also touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that z is fully inside x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary. This is also possible. z could touch y's boundary, be fully inside x, and not touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is not possible because y is inside x, and z touches y, so z and x can't be identical.

Actually, on further reflection, I think that I've been incorrect when I've said that EC(x,z) is not possible. Let's think about this scenario more carefully.

We have:
- y is completely inside x, without touching x's boundary.
- z touches y at y's boundary, but z and y don't have interior overlap.

Could z possibly touch x at x's boundary, without having interior overlap with x? Let's think step by step.

Since y is inside x, y's boundary is also inside x. So if z touches y's boundary, z has at least a point inside x. But having a point inside x doesn't mean that z has interior overlap with x.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully in terms of topology. In RCC-8, for two regions to be externally connected (EC), their boundaries should intersect, but their interiors shouldn't. 

Let's call the interior of a region its "interior", the exterior of the region its "exterior", and the boundary of a region its "boundary".

For EC(a,b) to hold, the following conditions must be satisfied:
- interior(a) ∩ interior(b) = ∅ (empty set)
- boundary(a) ∩ boundary(b) ≠ ∅ (non-empty set)

Now, for EC(x,z) to be possible, the interiors of x and z should not intersect, but their boundaries should.

But we know that y is inside x, without touching x's boundary. And z touches y's boundary. This means that z has at least a point on y's boundary, which is inside x. This suggests that z and x have interior overlap, which contradicts EC(x,z).

But wait, if z only touches y at a single point on y's boundary, then that point is on the boundary of z as well. And if that point is inside x, it doesn't necessarily mean that z's interior overlaps with x's interior.

Actually, let me be more careful here.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x's interior.
EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap.

Given these, can EC(x,z) be possible? 

EC(x,z) would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap. But since y is inside x, y's boundary is also inside x. So, if z touches y's boundary, it has a part inside x, which would make it overlap with x's interior. So, EC(x,z) isn't possible.

Actually, I'm getting confused by my own reasoning. Let me approach this differently.

For EC(a,b) to hold, the interiors of a and b should be disjoint, and their boundaries should intersect. If the interior of z intersects with the interior of x, then EC(x,z) is not possible.

We know that y is inside x, without touching x's boundary. So, the entirety of y, including its boundary, is inside x. 

Now, z touches y at y's boundary. This means that z has at least one point (the touching point) inside x. The question is, is this point in the interior of x or on the boundary of x?

Since y's boundary is inside x's interior (because y is non-tangentially inside x), the touching point between y and z is also inside x's interior. This means that z has at least one point in x's interior.

So, if z has a point in x's interior, it can't be externally connected to x. EC(x,z) is not possible.

I think the possible relationships are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me verify the PO(x,z) case again. PO(x,z) means that there's a region common to both x and z, but neither is a proper part of the other. Basically, some of z is inside x, and some of z is outside x.

For this to happen, z would need to extend from y's boundary (which is inside x) to outside of x. This is definitely possible, and in this case, x and z would partially overlap.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm quite confident in this answer now. Let me double-check if I missed anything:

1. DC(x,z) is not possible.
2. EC(x,z) is not possible.
3. PO(x,z) is possible.
4. TPP(x,z) is not possible.
5. NTPP(x,z) is not possible.
6. TPPi(x,z) is possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z) is possible.
8. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the answer is: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z given the constraints NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

First, let me analyze what the constraints tell us:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected - they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap in their interiors.

Now I'll consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since z touches y's boundary and y is inside x, z must have some contact with x.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since y's boundary is entirely inside x's interior (due to NTPPi), and z touches y's boundary, z must intersect with x's interior, not just its boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If z touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. For x to be a tangential proper part of z, z would need to completely cover x, which can't happen if z only touches y at y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible, for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely contained within x, touches y's boundary, and also touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. If z is completely contained within x, touches y's boundary, but doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside x and z only touches y's boundary, z cannot be identical to x.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
