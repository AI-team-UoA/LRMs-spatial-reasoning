PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We're given that:
1. EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is entirely contained within z, without touching z's boundary.

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same spatial region. And since NTPP(y,z), y is entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, x must also be entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary. This implies NTPP(x,z).

In fact, because EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same, and y is NTPP to z, then x must also be NTPP to z. So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

- x and y are exactly the same (EQ).
- y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary (NTPP).
- Therefore, x must also be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary (NTPP).

So, the answer is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary)

Since x and y are exactly the same spatial region (EQ(x,y)), and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), then x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
