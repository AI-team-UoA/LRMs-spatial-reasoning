PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
2. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. Another way to say this is TPP(z,y).

Now, I need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's visualize this:
- x and y are externally connected (they touch at the boundary).
- z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary).

The possible scenarios:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if z is a part of y but doesn't touch the same boundary where x and y touch.
2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z touches y's boundary at the same place where x touches y. In this case, x and z would be externally connected.
3. PO(x,z): This doesn't seem possible because z is entirely within y, and x is entirely outside y (except for the boundary they share). For x and z to partially overlap, they'd need to share interior points, which contradicts the given relations.
4. TPP(x,z): This doesn't seem possible because x is not inside y, so it can't be inside z (which is inside y).
5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this isn't possible for the same reason as TPP.
6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is inside x, but that's not possible because z is inside y, and x is outside y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, this isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): This isn't possible because z is inside y, and x is outside y.

Let me double-check my analysis:

Actually, I need to be more careful here. TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y inverse, which means y is a tangential proper part of z. So, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So, the correct interpretations are:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
2. TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This seems possible if the part of y's boundary that touches x is not the part that touches z's boundary.
2. EC(x,z): This seems possible if the part of y's boundary that touches x also touches z's boundary.
3. PO(x,z): This seems possible because x is outside y, and z contains y, so x and z might have a partial overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): This seems possible if x is entirely inside z but touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): This seems possible if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): This doesn't seem possible because x is not containing z (z contains y, and y touches x only at the boundary).
7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, this isn't possible for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): This doesn't seem possible because z contains y, and x is separate from y (except at the boundary).

Wait, I think I'm still not being precise. Let me be more careful:

TPPi(y,z) means that y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. In other words, z contains y, and y touches z's boundary.

So:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
2. TPPi(y,z): z contains y, and y touches z's boundary.

Let's visualize: y is inside z, and x is outside y but touches y at the boundary. Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This doesn't seem possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary at the same point, then x would also touch z. If y touches z's boundary at a different point, then x would still be connected to z through y.
2. EC(x,z): This seems possible if the part of y's boundary that touches x also touches z's boundary. In this case, x would touch z at the boundary.
3. PO(x,z): This seems possible if x partially extends into z. Given that y is inside z and x touches y, x might partially overlap with z.
4. TPP(x,z): This seems possible if x is entirely inside z but touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): This seems possible if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): This doesn't seem consistent with the given relations. If z contains y, and x is outside y, then x cannot contain z.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, this isn't consistent for the same reason as TPPi.
8. EQ(x,z): This doesn't seem consistent because z contains y, and x is separate from y (except at the boundary).

Hmm, I'm still not sure about all of these. Let me try to be even more precise.

Given EC(x, y), we know x and y touch at the boundary but share no interior parts.
Given TPPi(y, z), we know y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Another way to say this is TPP(z, y) is false; it's TPP(y, z) that's true.

Sorry, I'm mixing things up. TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. 

Wait, let me double check. TPPi means "inverse of TPP." If TPP(a, b) means a is a tangential proper part of b, then TPPi(a, b) means b is a tangential proper part of a. So, TPPi(y, z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So:
1. EC(x, y): x and y touch at the boundary but share no interior parts.
2. TPPi(y, z): z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Hmm, I'm still not confident. TPPi would be the inverse of TPP. So if TPP(a, b) means a is inside b and touches b's boundary, then TPPi(a, b) would mean b is inside a and touches a's boundary. So TPPi(y, z) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary. Let's stick with that.

Alright, so:
1. EC(x, y): x and y touch at the boundary but share no interior parts.
2. TPPi(y, z): z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's visualize:
- x is outside y but touches y at the boundary.
- z is inside y and also touches y's boundary.

The possible scenarios between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This seems possible if z touches a different part of y's boundary than x does. In this case, x and z would not be connected.
2. EC(x, z): This seems possible if z touches the same part of y's boundary that x does. In this case, x and z would touch at the boundary.
3. PO(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because z is entirely inside y, and x is entirely outside y (except for the boundary). For x and z to partially overlap, they'd need to share interior points, which contradicts the given relations.
4. TPP(x, z): This doesn't seem possible for the same reason.
5. NTPP(x, z): Similarly, this isn't possible.
6. TPPi(x, z): This doesn't seem possible either.
7. NTPPi(x, z): Similarly, this isn't possible.
8. EQ(x, z): This isn't possible because z is inside y, and x is outside y.

So, I think the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x, z) and EC(x, z).

Actually, let me check again:

* TPPi(y, z) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary. Let me actually look at the definition again:

TPPi(y, z) is the inverse of TPP(y, z).
TPP(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
TPPi(y, z) means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

So, I had the correct interpretation: z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let's visualize:
- x is outside y but touches y at the boundary.
- z is inside y and also touches y's boundary.

The possible scenarios between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This seems possible if z touches a different part of y's boundary than x does. In this case, x and z would not be connected.
2. EC(x, z): This seems possible if z touches the same part of y's boundary that x does. In this case, x and z would touch at the boundary.
3. PO(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because z is entirely inside y, and x is entirely outside y (except for the boundary). For x and z to partially overlap, they'd need to share interior points, which contradicts the given relations.
4. TPP(x, z): This doesn't seem possible for the same reason.
5. NTPP(x, z): Similarly, this isn't possible.
6. TPPi(x, z): This doesn't seem possible either.
7. NTPPi(x, z): Similarly, this isn't possible.
8. EQ(x, z): This isn't possible because z is inside y, and x is outside y.

So, I believe the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x, z) and EC(x, z).

Actually, I want to be absolutely sure, so let me check the definitions of RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x, y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x, y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x, y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x, y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x, y): y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x, y): y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x, y): x and y are coincident.

Given:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at the boundary but share no interior parts.
- TPPi(y, z): z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Now, let me redraw the scenario:
- x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This is possible if z doesn't touch the same part of y's boundary where x touches y.
2. EC(x, z): This is possible if z touches the same part of y's boundary where x touches y.
3. PO(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because z is entirely inside y, and x is entirely outside y (except for the boundary). For x and z to partially overlap, they'd need to share interior points, which contradicts the given relations.
4. TPP(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because for x to be a tangential proper part of z, x would need to be inside z. But since z is inside y, and x is outside y (except for the boundary), x can't be inside z.
5. NTPP(x, z): For similar reasons, this isn't possible.
6. TPPi(x, z): This would mean z is inside x, which doesn't align with the given scenario where z is inside y.
7. NTPPi(x, z): Similarly, this isn't possible.
8. EQ(x, z): This isn't possible because z is inside y, and x is outside y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x, z) and EC(x, z).

To further check my reasoning, let me restate the meanings of EC and TPPi:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at the boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- TPPi(y, z) means TPP(z, y), which is z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

Alright, so x and y touch at the boundary, and z is inside y and also touches y's boundary. If z touches the same part of y's boundary that x does, then x and z would also touch at the boundary, giving EC(x, z). If z touches a different part of y's boundary, then x and z would not be connected, giving DC(x, z).

So, I'm confident the answer is: DC(x, z) or EC(x, z).

Actually, let me double check my reasoning using a specific example. 

Let's say y is a circle. TPPi(y, z) means z is inside y and touches y's boundary. So, z could be a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at one point.

EC(x, y) means x and y touch at the boundary. So, x could be another circle outside y, touching y's boundary at one point.

Now, if x and z happen to touch y at the same point, then x and z would also touch, giving EC(x, z). If they touch y at different points, then x and z would not be connected, giving DC(x, z).

So, indeed, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x, z) and EC(x, z).

Hmm, I realize it may not be that simple. Let's think about this more rigorously:

We know:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y, z): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let's introduce notation: B(a) for the boundary of a, I(a) for the interior of a.

So, EC(x, y) means:
- x and y don't share interior points: I(x) ∩ I(y) = ∅.
- x and y touch at the boundary: B(x) ∩ B(y) ≠ ∅.

TPPi(y, z) means:
- z is a proper part of y: z ⊂ y.
- z touches y's boundary: B(z) ∩ B(y) ≠ ∅.

Now, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

First, we know z is entirely inside y. Since x and y don't share interior points, x and z can't share interior points either. This eliminates PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

But x and z might or might not touch at the boundary. It depends on whether the points where z touches y's boundary are the same as the points where x touches y's boundary.

Let's define:
- Txy = B(x) ∩ B(y) (the points where x and y touch).
- Tzy = B(z) ∩ B(y) (the points where z and y touch).

If Txy ∩ Tzy ≠ ∅, then x and z touch, giving EC(x, z).
If Txy ∩ Tzy = ∅, then x and z don't touch, giving DC(x, z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x, z) and EC(x, z).

I believe my answer is correct, but let's actually try a slightly different formalization to check.

We know:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y, z): z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

From the definition of EC, we have:
- x ∩ y ≠ ∅ (x and y have a non-empty intersection).
- I(x) ∩ I(y) = ∅ (the interiors of x and y don't intersect).

From the definition of TPPi, we have:
- z ⊂ y (z is a proper part of y).
- B(z) ∩ B(y) ≠ ∅ (z touches y's boundary).

Given this, let's determine the relationship between x and z:

1. x ∩ z ? 
   We know x ∩ y ≠ ∅ and z ⊂ y. But x ∩ y is just on the boundary, and z could either touch this boundary at the same points or not. If they touch at the same points, then x ∩ z ≠ ∅. Otherwise, x ∩ z = ∅.

2. I(x) ∩ I(z) ?
   We know I(x) ∩ I(y) = ∅ and z ⊂ y. This means I(z) ⊂ I(y) (the interior of z is a subset of the interior of y). Hence, I(x) ∩ I(z) = ∅.

Given these two conclusions, the possible relationships are:
- If x ∩ z = ∅, then DC(x, z).
- If x ∩ z ≠ ∅ and I(x) ∩ I(z) = ∅, then EC(x, z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC(x, z) and EC(x, z).

Let me just make sure that all RCC-8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) can't hold between x and z:

DC (Disconnected): This is possible if z doesn't touch the same part of y's boundary that x does.
EC (Externally Connected): This is possible if z touches the same part of y's boundary that x does.
PO (Partially Overlapping): This isn't possible because I(x) ∩ I(z) = ∅.
TPP (Tangential Proper Part): This isn't possible because x is not a part of z.
NTPP (Non-Tangential Proper Part): This isn't possible for the same reason.
TPPi (Inverse of TPP): This isn't possible because z is not a part of x.
NTPPi (Inverse of NTPP): This isn't possible for the same reason.
EQ (Equal): This isn't possible because x and z are not the same.

Alright, I think my answer is pretty solid: The possible relationships between x and z are DC(x, z) and EC(x, z).

Actually, I just realized I've been misinterpreting TPPi(y, z). Let me make sure I understand the definitions correctly:

- TPP(x, y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x, y): y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

So, TPPi(y, z) means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary. Or another way, y contains z as a proper part, and z touches y's boundary.

Wait, I think I have TPPi backwards in my definition. Let me clarify:

- TPP(x, y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(x, y): y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

So, TPPi(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Or in other words, z contains y as a proper part, and y touches z's boundary.

Let me update my understanding:

- EC(x, y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y, z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Alternatively, z properly contains y, and y touches z's boundary.

Now, let me think about the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that y is a proper part of z and x touches y at the boundary, x can have various relations with z:

1. DC(x, z): This doesn't seem possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, then x must at least touch z as well.
2. EC(x, z): This is possible if x touches z only at the boundary and doesn't penetrate inside z.
3. PO(x, z): This is possible if x partially penetrates inside z.
4. TPP(x, z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary, so x would also touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because y is inside z, and x is outside y (except for the boundary), so x can't contain z.
7. NTPPi(x, z): Similarly, this isn't possible.
8. EQ(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because y is a proper part of z, and x touches y at the boundary, so x and z can't be the same.

Hmm, I'm thinking more: NTPP(x, z) might be possible in some edge cases. Let's check again:

NTPP(x, z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given EC(x, y), x touches y at the boundary. Given TPPi(y, z), y touches z's boundary. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the point where x touches y is the same as the point where y touches z. If they are different, then x might be inside z without touching z's boundary.

Actually, let me check my reasoning here. TPPi(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. So, y is inside z and touches z's boundary. Now, if x is outside y and touches y's boundary, and the point where x touches y is not the same as the point where y touches z, then x could still be outside z and only touch z at the boundary.

Let me reconsider:

1. DC(x, z): This doesn't seem possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, then x must at least touch z as well.
2. EC(x, z): This is possible if x touches z only at the boundary and doesn't penetrate inside z.
3. PO(x, z): This is possible if x partially penetrates inside z.
4. TPP(x, z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary. If the point where x touches y is the same as the point where y touches z, then x would also touch z's boundary. If they are different, x might still touch z's boundary at a different point. But I can't visualize a scenario where x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because y is inside z, and x is outside y (except for the boundary), so x can't contain z.
7. NTPPi(x, z): Similarly, this isn't possible.
8. EQ(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because y is a proper part of z, and x touches y at the boundary, so x and z can't be the same.

So, I believe the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), and TPP(x, z).

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(x, z) once more:

We have:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y, z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

For NTPP(x, z) to be true, x must be inside z and not touch z's boundary.

Given that x touches y's boundary (from EC(x, y)), the question is: Can x touch y at a point that's inside z, but not on z's boundary?

I'm thinking that in 2D, this doesn't seem possible. If y touches z's boundary, then y's boundary has at least one point on z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary, it can't touch y at a point inside z without touching z's boundary, unless y's boundary extends inside z. But then, y would not be a proper part of z.

But maybe I'm not being imaginative enough with higher dimensions. Let me simplify:

Let's say z is a 3D cube, and y is a 2D square embedded in z, with one edge of y being on the boundary of z. Now, x is another 2D square that touches y's boundary but is orthogonal to y. In this case, x can be inside z without touching z's boundary, giving NTPP(x, z).

Actually, wait, that's not the right example, because to be tangential parts, the boundaries of both parts need to intersect. So y would need to be a 3D object like a smaller cube inside the bigger cube z, with one face touching a face of z. And then x could be another 3D object, like a cube outside y but touching y at a point or edge, but that point or edge doesn't intersect with z's boundary.

So, I think NTPP(x, z) is actually not possible.

Let me reconsider the possibilities once more:

1. DC(x, z): This doesn't seem possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, then x must at least touch z as well.
2. EC(x, z): This is possible if x touches z only at the boundary and doesn't penetrate inside z.
3. PO(x, z): This is possible if x partially penetrates inside z.
4. TPP(x, z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary. If x touches y at a point that's inside z but not on z's boundary, then y's boundary would have to extend inside z, contradicting the fact that y is a proper part of z.
6. TPPi(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because y is inside z, and x is outside y (except for the boundary), so x can't contain z.
7. NTPPi(x, z): Similarly, this isn't possible.
8. EQ(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because y is a proper part of z, and x touches y at the boundary, so x and z can't be the same.

So, I believe the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), and TPP(x, z).

Actually, let me check my reasoning again by using a specific example:

Let's say z is a large square, and y is a smaller square inside z, with one edge of y touching one edge of z. Now, x is a square outside y, with one corner of x touching one corner of y.

In this case, the corner of x would also touch the corner of z, giving EC(x, z).

Now, if x is positioned such that it partially enters z, we'd have PO(x, z).

And if x is positioned such that it's entirely inside z but still touches the boundary of z, we'd have TPP(x, z).

Can we have a scenario where x is entirely inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary? I don't think so. Because x touches y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, there would always be a path from x to z's boundary through y.

I'm still not sure about NTPP(x, z). Let me consider a different example:

Imagine z is a cube. Inside z, there's a smaller cube y, with one face of y touching one face of z. Now, x is a cube outside y, touching y at one of its edges that's not part of the face where y touches z.

In this case, x might be entirely inside z but not touch z's boundary, giving NTPP(x, z).

Hmm, but I realize another issue. TPPi(y, z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y can only touch z's boundary, not penetrate it. So, x can't be outside z and still touch y, which means EC(x, z) is not possible. Similarly, PO(x, z) doesn't seem possible either.

Actually no, that's not right. TPPi(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. This doesn't mean y can't penetrate the boundary of z. It means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So, let's review the possibilities again:

1. DC(x, z): This doesn't seem possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, then x must at least touch z as well.
2. EC(x, z): This is possible if x touches z only at the boundary and doesn't penetrate inside z.
3. PO(x, z): This is possible if x partially penetrates inside z.
4. TPP(x, z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x, z): I'm unsure, but I think this might be possible in higher dimensions. Let me try to settle this.

Let's visualize:
- z is a 3D cube.
- y is a smaller 3D cube inside z, with one face of y touching one face of z.
- x is a 3D cube outside y, touching y at one of its edges that's not part of the face where y touches z.

In this case, x might be entirely inside z but not touch z's boundary.

Actually, upon careful thought:

If x touches y's boundary, and that point of contact on y is not on z's boundary, then x would be inside z. But because y touches z's boundary, there's a path from the point where x touches y to the point where y touches z. If this path lies entirely on y's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary. If not, then x would not be a tangential proper part of z.

So, NTPP(x, z) is possible if x touches y at a point that's not on the same part of y's boundary that touches z. This would make x a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually wait, I think I've been overthinking this.

Let's go back to the basics:
- EC(x, y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
- TPPi(y, z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

From EC(x, y), we know x touches y's boundary but doesn't penetrate inside y.
From TPPi(y, z), we know y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This doesn't seem possible. If x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x must at least touch z as well.
2. EC(x, z): This is possible if x touches z only at the boundary and doesn't penetrate inside z.
3. PO(x, z): This is possible if x partially penetrates inside z.
4. TPP(x, z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x, z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given the setup, I don't see why this can't happen. If y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary at a point that's not on z's boundary, then x can be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because y is inside z, and x is outside y (except for the boundary), so x can't contain z.
7. NTPPi(x, z): Similarly, this isn't possible.
8. EQ(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because y is a proper part of z, and x touches y at the boundary, so x and z can't be the same.

So, I believe the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, can I do a bit more thinking. Let's focus on NTPP(x, z), which I think is the relationship I'm least certain about:

For NTPP(x, z), x must be inside z and not touch z's boundary.

If y touches z's boundary (from TPPi(y, z)), and x touches y's boundary (from EC(x, y)), can x be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary?

Let's consider a 2D example: Imagine z is a big circle, and y is a smaller circle inside z, with y touching z's boundary at one point. Now, x is a circle outside y, touching y's boundary at a different point.

In this case, if x is very small, it might be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, giving NTPP(x, z).

I think NTPP(x, z) is a valid possibility.

Let me summarize again:

1. DC(x, z): This doesn't seem possible.
2. EC(x, z): This is possible.
3. PO(x, z): This is possible.
4. TPP(x, z): This is possible.
5. NTPP(x, z): This is possible.
6. TPPi(x, z): This doesn't seem possible.
7. NTPPi(x, z): This doesn't seem possible.
8. EQ(x, z): This doesn't seem possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, let me reconsider DC(x, z):

DC(x, z) means x and z are disconnected.

Given EC(x, y), x touches y's boundary. Given TPPi(y, z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, does it necessarily mean x and z touch? 

Let's visualize in 2D: Imagine z is a big circle, and y is a smaller circle inside z, with y touching z's boundary at one point. Now, x is a circle outside y, touching y's boundary at a different point.

If x touches y's boundary, could x still be outside z? It seems like it could. If z is a large circle and y is a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at one point, then x could be a circle completely outside z, with x touching y's boundary.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If y is inside z and x touches y, then x must at least touch z, so DC(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, I'm overthinking. If TPPi(y, z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and EC(x, y) means x touches y's boundary, then x can still be completely outside z. For instance, if z is a big circle, y is a small circle inside z, with y just barely touching z's boundary, and x is a circle outside z that just barely touches y at the same point where y touches z.

So, DC(x, z) doesn't seem possible, as I originally concluded.

I believe the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, wait, that's inconsistent. If x can be completely outside z, then DC(x, z) is possible. Let me reconsider.

TPPi(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. The proper part means y is a subset of z, but not equal to z. So, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

EC(x, y) means x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. So, x is outside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, the question is: If y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, can x be outside z?

If y touches z's boundary at a point, and x touches y at the same point, then x would also touch z at that point. In this case, we'd have EC(x, z).

If y touches z's boundary at a point, and x touches y at a different point, then x might be inside or outside z. If x is outside z, we'd have DC(x, z). If x is inside z, we'd have PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), or NTPP(x, z).

So, I think DC(x, z) is also a possibility.

Let me double check my visualization once more.

TPPi(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. So, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

EC(x, y) means x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. So, x is outside y and touches y's boundary.

Let's visualize in 2D: Imagine z is a big circle, and y is a smaller circle inside z, with y touching z's boundary at one point. Now, x is a circle outside y, touching y's boundary.

If x touches y at the same point where y touches z, then x would also touch z, giving EC(x, z).

If x touches y at a different point, then x can be either inside or outside z. If x is outside z, we'd have DC(x, z). If x is inside z, we'd have PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), or NTPP(x, z).

Actually, wait. I'm thinking about this wrong. Let's take a specific example to clarify:

Imagine z is a big circle centered at the origin with radius 3. Inside z, there's a smaller circle y centered at (1, 0) with radius 1. Notice that y touches z's boundary at (2, 0).

Now, let's consider a circle x centered at (4, 0) with radius 1. x touches y's boundary at (2, 0), which is also where y touches z's boundary.

In this case, x touches z at (2, 0), giving EC(x, z).

But now, let's slightly change the setup. Consider a circle x centered at (1, 2) with radius 1. x touches y's boundary at (1, 1). However, the point (1, 1) is inside z. If x is small enough, it might be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary, giving NTPP(x, z). Or if x is larger, it might touch z's boundary, giving TPP(x, z). If x is even larger, it might partially overlap with z, giving PO(x, z).

Finally, consider a circle x centered at (4, 1) with radius 2. x touches y's boundary at (2, 0). The point (2, 0) is on z's boundary. Given the radius of x, part of x would be outside z, part inside, giving PO(x, z).

But I still can't visualize a scenario where DC(x, z) is possible. If y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then x must at least touch z's boundary. Thus, DC(x, z) doesn't seem possible.

Actually, wait, I was confused. If TPPi(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary, y is inside z. And if EC(x, y) means x touches y's boundary, then x might be outside z.

Let's take the example from earlier: Imagine z is a big circle centered at the origin with radius 3. Inside z, there's a smaller circle y centered at (1, 0) with radius 1. Notice that y touches z's boundary at (2, 0).

Now, let's consider a circle x centered at (1, 2) with radius 1. x touches y's boundary at (1, 1). 

Wait, this doesn't work because (1, 1) is inside z. Let me find a different example.

Imagine z is a big circle centered at the origin with radius 3. Inside z, there's a smaller circle y centered at (1, 0) with radius 1. Notice that y touches z's boundary at (2, 0).

Now, let's consider a circle x centered at (0, 2) with radius 1. x touches y's boundary at (0, 1). The point (0, 1) is inside z.

But given the radius of x, the entirety of x might still be inside z. So, we'd have either TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z).

I'm trying to find a scenario where DC(x, z) is possible, but I still can't visualize it. If y is inside z and x touches y, how can x be outside z?

Hmm I've been thinking about this for a while. Let me try a different approach. Maybe my examples in 2D don't work, and I need to think about higher dimensions.

In 3D, imagine z is a big cube, and y is a smaller cube inside z, with one face of y touching one face of z. Now, x is a cube outside y, touching y at one of its edges that's not on the face where y touches z.

Can x be outside z? I still don't think so. If y is inside z and x touches y, then x must at least touch z.

Let me try to formalize this. If TPPi(y, z), then y ⊂ z. If EC(x, y), then x ∩ y ≠ ∅ but I(x) ∩ I(y) = ∅. 

Given these conditions, it's not clear that x must have a non-empty intersection with z. x touches y at the boundary, but this doesn't necessarily mean x touches z.

I think DC(x, z) might be possible if y touches z's boundary at one point, and x touches y's boundary at a different point, and x is positioned in a way that it doesn't intersect with z.

But as I think more, I'm having doubts. If y ⊂ z, and x touches y, then x must touch a part of y that's inside z. This means x and z must have a non-empty intersection, making DC(x, z) impossible.

So, I'm back to concluding that the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, I think I'm making a basic error in my visualization. If TPPi(y, z), it means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Let's say y touches z's boundary at point p.

Now, EC(x, y) means x touches y's boundary. Let's say x touches y's boundary at point q.

if p ≠ q, then q is a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary. Since y is inside z, q is also inside z. Hence, x touches a point inside z, making DC(x, z) impossible.

If p = q, then x touches y at the same point where y touches z. In this case, x also touches z, making DC(x, z) impossible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Alright, I believe the answer is correct now.

Wait, I suddenly realized something: TPPi(y, z) means y is not just a proper part of z but a tangential proper part of z. This means y touches z's boundary. Given this, the question is: If x touches y's boundary, can x be outside z and not touch z?

Let's visualize: z is a big circle, and y is a smaller circle inside z, with y touching z's boundary at one point. Now, x is a circle outside y, touching y's boundary.

If x touches y at the same point where y touches z, then x would also touch z, giving EC(x, z).

If x touches y at a different point, that point must be inside z (since y is inside z). This means x must at least touch z, making DC(x, z) impossible.

So, I still maintain that the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, I realized we might also need to consider whether x and z can have a different kind of relation, such as EQ. So let me consider all RCC-8 relations systematically, between x and z.

1. DC(x, z): As discussed, this doesn't seem possible. If y is inside z and x touches y, then x must at least touch z.
2. EC(x, z): This is possible if x touches z only at the boundary and doesn't penetrate inside z.
3. PO(x, z): This is possible if x partially penetrates inside z.
4. TPP(x, z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x, z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x, z): For this to be true, z would need to be a proper part of x. Given that y is a proper part of z, and x is outside y (except for the boundary), this doesn't seem possible.
7. NTPPi(x, z): For similar reasons, this doesn't seem possible.
8. EQ(x, z): For this to be true, x and z would need to be the same. Given that y is a proper part of z, and x is outside y (except for the boundary), this doesn't seem possible.

So, I believe the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, let me make one final check. TPPi(y, z) means y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. EC(x, y) means x touches y's boundary but doesn't share interior parts with y.

Given these, let's consider all the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This is not possible. If y is inside z and x touches y, then x must at least touch z.
2. EC(x, z): This is possible if x touches z only at the boundary and doesn't penetrate inside z.
3. PO(x, z): This is possible if x partially penetrates inside z.
4. TPP(x, z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x, z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x, z): For this to be true, z would need to be a proper part of x. This doesn't seem possible given the constraints.
7. NTPPi(x, z): Similarly, this doesn't seem possible.
8. EQ(x, z): This doesn't seem possible because y is a proper part of z, and x touches y's boundary, so x and z can't be the same.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

I'm confident in this answer now.

Actually, I think I might have been too quick to rule out TPPi(x, z) and NTPPi(x, z). Let's reconsider these.

For TPPi(x, z), z would need to be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary. Given that y is a proper part of z, and x touches y's boundary, it seems unlikely that z could be a proper part of x.

For NTPPi(x, z), z would need to be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary. Again, given the constraints, this seems unlikely.

Wait, actually let's analyze all possibilities more rigorously. Let's revisit the definitions:

EC(x, y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. Mathematically, x ∩ y ≠ ∅ but I(x) ∩ I(y) = ∅.
TPPi(y, z): y is a tangential proper part of z. Mathematically, y ⊂ z, y ≠ z, and y touches z's boundary.

Now, let's consider all the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): For this, x ∩ z = ∅. But we know y ⊂ z and x ∩ y ≠ ∅. Hence, x ∩ z ≠ ∅, making DC(x, z) impossible.
2. EC(x, z): For this, x ∩ z ≠ ∅ but I(x) ∩ I(z) = ∅. This is possible. For instance, if x touches y at the same point where y touches z, then x would also touch z, but not penetrate inside.
3. PO(x, z): For this, I(x) ∩ I(z) ≠ ∅, x ⊈ z, and z ⊈ x. This is possible if x partially penetrates inside z.
4. TPP(x, z): For this, x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and x touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x, z): For this, x ⊂ z, x ≠ z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x, z): For this, z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and z touches x's boundary. Given that y ⊂ z, and x touches y's boundary, I don't see how z could be a proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x, z): For this, z ⊂ x, z ≠ x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, given the constraints, this doesn't seem possible.
8. EQ(x, z): For this, x = z. But we know y ⊂ z, and x touches y's boundary, so x and z can't be the same.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are EC(x, z), PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

I'm confident in this answer.

### Answer:
EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z, given EC(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let me analyze what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- TPPi(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary (z contains y, and y touches z's boundary)

Now I'll examine each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is impossible. Since y is inside z, and x touches y, x must at least touch z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. If x touches z only at the boundary without penetrating inside z. This happens when x touches y at the same point where y touches z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. If x partially penetrates inside z while part remains outside.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. If x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. If x is entirely inside z without touching z's boundary. This can happen if x touches y at a point of y's boundary that's inside z, away from where y touches z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible. Since y is inside z and x is at least partially outside y, x cannot contain z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible. Given that y is a proper part of z, and x touches y's boundary, x and z cannot be identical.

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
