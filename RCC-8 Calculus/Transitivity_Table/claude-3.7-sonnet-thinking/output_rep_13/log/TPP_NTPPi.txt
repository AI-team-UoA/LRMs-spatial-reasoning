PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think through this carefully. I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations that can hold between x and z given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part inverse of z, which means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y

So we have:
1. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
2. NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y

Let me visualize this:
- y is a region
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary

Since z is completely contained within y (not touching y's boundary), and x is contained within y but touching y's boundary, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's consider all 8 possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   Since both x and z are inside y, they could be completely separate regions within y. This is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected (touching at their boundaries)
   This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This is possible if x and z share some common region but neither is contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   For this to be true, x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. 
   Wait, let me think about whether this is possible. We know that x touches y's boundary and z does not touch y's boundary. If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, can it also touch y's boundary? Yes, it can. If z is positioned such that part of its boundary is close to y's boundary, and x touches both z's and y's boundaries, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This seems impossible because x touches y's boundary, and z is completely inside y not touching y's boundary. If x were completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then x couldn't touch y's boundary either.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if x contains z and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if x completely contains z.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
   This is impossible because x touches y's boundary while z does not, so they can't be the same region.

Let me double-check my reasoning:

Wait, I think I got confused. Let me restate the premises:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPPi(y,z): This means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y

No, that's not right. NTPPi(y,z) means y is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. So we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

Let me visualize this correctly:
- z is a large region
- y is completely contained within z, not touching z's boundary
- x is contained within y and touches y's boundary

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   This is impossible because x is part of y, and y is part of z, so x must be part of z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected
   This is impossible because x is completely contained within y, which is completely contained within z, so x cannot touch z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This is impossible because x is completely contained within z (since x is in y and y is in z).

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. 
   But we know y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is inside y. So x cannot touch z's boundary either. This is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since x is inside y and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible and seems necessary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But z contains y which contains x, so z cannot be inside x. This is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But z contains y which contains x, so z cannot be inside x. This is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
   This is impossible because x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x must be a proper part of z and cannot be equal to z.

So it seems like the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Wait, let me review again. I want to be very careful.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

So z contains y completely (y doesn't touch z's boundary), and y contains x with x touching y's boundary.

Could x touch z's boundary? No, because if x touches z's boundary, then y would also have to touch z's boundary (since x touches y's boundary and is contained in y). But NTPPi(y,z) tells us that y doesn't touch z's boundary.

So x must be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, wait. Let me be even more careful here. I need to make sure I understand the definitions correctly.

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means:
- x is completely contained within y
- x touches y's boundary
- x ≠ y (proper part)

NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(z,y), so it means:
- y completely contains z
- z doesn't touch y's boundary
- z ≠ y (proper part)

Wait, I think I've been interpreting NTPPi backwards. Let me reconsider.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means:
- z is completely contained within y
- z doesn't touch y's boundary
- z ≠ y (proper part)

So we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y

Now the setup is:
- y is a region
- x is contained in y and touches y's boundary
- z is completely contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
   This is possible if x and z don't share any points.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected
   This is possible if x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap
   This is possible if x and z share some region but neither is completely contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z
   This is possible if x is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z
   This is possible if x is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x
   This is possible if z is completely contained in x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x
   This is possible if z is completely contained in x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal
   This is possible if x and z are the same region.

Actually, since both x and z are inside y, and we don't have any constraints on their relationship to each other, any of the 8 relations could hold between them.

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let's think about each possibility again:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z don't share any points. Since both x and z are contained in y, this is possible if they are in different parts of y.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible within y.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible within y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible within y.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible within y.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary but x does, z could be inside x touching x's internal boundary (not the part where x touches y). This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible within y.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. But this is impossible because x touches y's boundary while z doesn't, so they can't be the same region.

So based on this analysis, all relations except EQ(x,z) are possible.

Wait, let me double-check my understanding again. I want to make sure I've correctly interpreted NTPPi(y,z).

NTPPi(y,z) means the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which would be NTPP(z,y). So:
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely contained within y and doesn't touch y's boundary

So the premises are:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y

With this interpretation, my previous analysis is correct. Let me verify each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): Possible if x and z are in different parts of y.
2. EC(x,z): Possible if x and z touch at their boundaries.
3. PO(x,z): Possible if x and z partially overlap.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible if x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible if z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z): Impossible because x touches y's boundary while z doesn't.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I need to be more careful about this. Let's do one more check:

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPPi(y,z): NTPPi is the inverse of NTPP, so this means NTPP(z,y)

The setup is:
- y is a region
- x is contained in y and touches y's boundary
- z is completely contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Now, could z be a proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi)? If z is inside x, and x touches y's boundary, would z touch y's boundary? Not necessarily. Z could be inside x but away from the part where x touches y's boundary. So TPPi and NTPPi are possible.

Could x and z be disconnected (DC)? Yes, they could be in different parts of y.

Could x and z be externally connected (EC)? Yes, they could touch at their boundaries.

Could x and z partially overlap (PO)? Yes, they could share some region.

Could x be a proper part of z (TPP or NTPP)? Yes, x could be inside z.

Could x and z be equal (EQ)? No, because x touches y's boundary while z doesn't.

So the possible relationships are: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I think there's a flaw in my reasoning. If z is a non-tangential proper part of y, then z is completely inside y away from y's boundary. If x is a tangential proper part of y, then x touches y's boundary. Given these constraints, let me reconsider each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Since x touches y's boundary and z is away from y's boundary, they could be in different parts of y. Possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries. Since x touches y's boundary and z is away from y's boundary, they could still touch each other at some other part of their boundaries. Possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible regardless of their positions within y. Possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if z extends all the way to y's boundary. But wait, that contradicts the fact that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. If z doesn't touch y's boundary, and x does, then x cannot be completely inside z. So this is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is definitely impossible because x touches y's boundary, which z doesn't. So x cannot be completely inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if x extends beyond z in a way that reaches y's boundary. Possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if x completely contains z and extends to y's boundary. Possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. This is impossible because x touches y's boundary while z doesn't.

So the possible relationships are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Hmm, let me review my reasoning about TPP(x,z) again. I said it's impossible because if z doesn't touch y's boundary, and x does, then x cannot be completely inside z.

Wait, I think I misunderstood the TPP relationship. TPP(x,z) means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. It doesn't necessarily mean that x touches all boundaries that z touches. So it's still possible for x to touch y's boundary even if z doesn't, as long as z extends close enough to y's boundary for x to touch both z's and y's boundaries.

But actually, that's not possible. If x touches y's boundary and is completely inside z, then z must also touch y's boundary. But we know z doesn't touch y's boundary, so TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Let me verify my reasoning for each relation once more:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if they are in different parts of y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary and is completely inside z, then z must also touch y's boundary. But we know z doesn't touch y's boundary, so this is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. If x touches y's boundary, it cannot be completely inside z when z doesn't touch y's boundary. So this is impossible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This is impossible because x touches y's boundary while z doesn't.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, let me just double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) one more time.

For TPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, then the part of z's boundary that x touches must either be inside y or must be y's boundary itself. But z doesn't touch y's boundary, so the part of z's boundary that x touches must be inside y. But then, how can x touch y's boundary? It can't, which means TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then x is even more "inside" y and cannot touch y's boundary. But we know x does touch y's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

So, to summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, I'm a bit confused about my reasoning. Let me try a different approach. I'll start with the definitions and then draw some diagrams to help visualize the situation.

Definitions:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Let's draw a diagram:
- y is a region
- x is inside y and touches y's boundary
- z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. x and z could be completely separate regions within y. This would be DC(x,z).
2. x and z could touch at their boundaries. This would be EC(x,z).
3. x and z could partially overlap. This would be PO(x,z).
4. z could be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. This would be TPPi(x,z).
5. z could be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. This would be NTPPi(x,z).

Could x be inside z? If x touches y's boundary and is inside z, then z must also touch y's boundary. But we know z doesn't touch y's boundary, so x cannot be inside z. This rules out TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Could x and z be the same region? No, because x touches y's boundary while z doesn't. This rules out EQ(x,z).

So the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

I think I'm second-guessing myself too much. Let me go with this final answer: the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

Actually, now I'm noticing that there's an issue with my interpretation of NTPPi(y,z).

NTPPi(y,z) means that y is contained in z without touching z's boundary. It's the inverse of NTPP(z,y), which would mean z is contained in y without touching y's boundary. I need to be careful to interpret it correctly.

So, NTPPi(y,z) means:
- y is completely contained within z
- y doesn't touch z's boundary
- y ≠ z (proper part)

Now let's reconsider the premises:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

So the setup is:
- z is a large region
- y is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary
- x is contained in y and touches y's boundary

With this setup, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is impossible because x is part of y, and y is part of z, so x must also be part of z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is impossible because x is completely contained within y, which is completely contained within z without touching z's boundary. So x cannot touch z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is impossible because x is completely contained within z (since x is in y and y is in z). For PO, we need parts of x to be outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is inside y, so x cannot touch z's boundary either. This is impossible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since x is inside y, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible and in fact, necessary.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But z contains y which contains x, so z cannot be inside x. This is impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But z contains y which contains x, so z cannot be inside x. This is impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. This is impossible because x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, so x must be a proper part of z and cannot be equal to z.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I'm pretty confident this is correct, but let me go through the logic one more time.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z

This means:
- x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary
- y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

The relation between x and z:
- x must be inside z because x is inside y and y is inside z
- x cannot touch z's boundary because y doesn't touch z's boundary and x is inside y
- x cannot be equal to z because x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z

So the only possible relation is NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, let me make a correction. I made an error in reasoning:

- x is inside y and touches y's boundary
- y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary
- therefore, x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

But wait, I need to be careful. Just because x touches y's boundary doesn't mean it touches z's boundary. The fact that y doesn't touch z's boundary means that there's a "buffer" region between y and z. Since x is inside y and y is inside z with this buffer, x must be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually I think my argument is correct. Let me just re-walk through the process once more.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is completely contained in y and touches y's boundary
- NTPPi(y,z): y is completely contained in z and doesn't touch z's boundary

This means:
- x is inside y, touching y's boundary
- y is inside z, not touching z's boundary
- By transitivity, x is inside z

Since y doesn't touch z's boundary and x is inside y, x also cannot touch z's boundary. This means the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

To verify, let's check all 8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because x is inside z.
2. EC(x,z): Impossible because x cannot touch z's boundary.
3. PO(x,z): Impossible because x is completely inside z.
4. TPP(x,z): Impossible because x cannot touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible and necessary because x is inside z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible because z cannot be inside x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible because z cannot be inside x.
8. EQ(x,z): Impossible because x is a proper part of z.

So the answer is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I think I understand what was tripping me up. I was visualizing x possibly being in that "buffer" region between y and z, which could potentially allow x to touch z's boundary. But this isn't consistent with the given that x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is completely inside y and touches y's boundary. Since y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x must also be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

So the final answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, let me just carefully check one relation:
TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But y doesn't touch z's boundary, and x is inside y, so there's no way for x to touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is indeed impossible.

Yes, I'm convinced now. The only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I just realized that my understanding of tangential proper part may be flawed. Let me be precise about this.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y (i.e., x is entirely contained within y and x ≠ y)
- x and y share at least one boundary point

NTPPi(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z (i.e., y is entirely contained within z and y ≠ z)
- y and z do not share any boundary points

Given these, if x is entirely within y and shares a boundary point with y, and y is entirely within z but doesn't share any boundary points with z, then:
- x must be entirely within z (because x is within y and y is within z)
- x cannot share any boundary points with z (because if it did, then y would also share that boundary point with z, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z))

So the relationship between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

Actually, there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me clarify the relationship between boundaries.

In TPP(x,y), x is a proper part of y and they share at least one boundary point. This doesn't mean x touches the outer boundary of y; it means they have a common boundary point. Similarly, in NTPPi(y,z), y is a proper part of z and they don't share any boundary points.

Let me try to visualize this again:
- z is a large region
- y is completely inside z, and the boundary of y doesn't intersect with the boundary of z
- x is completely inside y, and the boundary of x intersects with the boundary of y

The question is: what's the relationship between x and z?

Since x is completely inside y and y is completely inside z, x must be completely inside z. Now, does the boundary of x intersect with the boundary of z? No, because if it did, then the boundary of y would also intersect with the boundary of z, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z).

So, x is completely inside z and doesn't share any boundary points with z. This means NTPP(x,z).

I am overthinking this, I keep arriving at the same conclusion! Let's make it simple:

- TPP(x,y) means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

If x is inside y and y is inside z, then x must be inside z. And if y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x, being inside y, also cannot touch z's boundary.

So, x is inside z without touching z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z).

To be absolutely clear, let me verify this one more time by checking all 8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible because x is inside z.
2. EC(x,z): Impossible because x cannot touch z's boundary.
3. PO(x,z): Impossible because x is completely inside z.
4. TPP(x,z): Impossible because x cannot touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible and necessary because x is inside z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z): Impossible because z cannot be inside x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Impossible because z cannot be inside x.
8. EQ(x,z): Impossible because x is a proper part of z.

So the answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationship x and z can have given TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

Let's analyze what these relations tell us:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary)

From these facts:
1. x is inside y (from TPP)
2. y is inside z (from NTPPi)
3. Therefore, x must be inside z (by transitivity)
4. y doesn't touch z's boundary (from NTPPi)
5. Since x is inside y, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, x cannot touch z's boundary either

Since x is completely inside z and cannot touch z's boundary, the only possible relationship is NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let me verify by checking other possibilities:
- DC, EC, PO: Impossible because x must be completely inside z
- TPP: Impossible because x cannot touch z's boundary
- TPPi, NTPPi: Impossible because z cannot be inside x
- EQ: Impossible because x is a proper part of z

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
