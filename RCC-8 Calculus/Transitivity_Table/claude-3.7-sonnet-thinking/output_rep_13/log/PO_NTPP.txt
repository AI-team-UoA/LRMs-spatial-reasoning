PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We have:
- PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap, meaning they share some parts but neither is part of the other.
- NTPP(y, z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, we need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

First, let's recall all the RCC-8 relations:
1. DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected
2. EC(x, y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at their boundaries)
3. PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap
4. TPP(x, y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y but touches y's boundary)
5. NTPP(x, y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y)
6. TPPi(x, y): y is a tangential proper part of x (equivalent to TPP(y, x))
7. NTPPi(x, y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (equivalent to NTPP(y, x))
8. EQ(x, y): x and y are equal

Now, given that PO(x, y) and NTPP(y, z), let's determine what relations are possible for x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This is not possible. Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, at least some part of x must be inside z.

2. EC(x, z): This is possible. x can partially overlap with y (which is inside z), and the rest of x can touch z's boundary without any interior overlap.

3. PO(x, z): This is possible. x can partially overlap with y (which is inside z), and the rest of x can extend outside z, resulting in a partial overlap between x and z.

4. TPP(x, z): This is possible. x can partially overlap with y (which is inside z), and the rest of x can be inside z, touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x, z): This is possible. x can partially overlap with y (which is inside z), and the rest of x can be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x, z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which seems contradictory to NTPP(y, z) because if z is a part of x, and y is a part of z, then y would be a part of x, contradicting PO(x, y). So this is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): Similarly, this means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which contradicts PO(x, y) for the same reason as above. So this is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): This means x and z are equal. If x and z are equal, and y is a part of z, then y would be a part of x, contradicting PO(x, y). So this is not possible.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let me reconsider each case more thoroughly.

1. DC(x, z): If x and z are disconnected, and y is completely inside z, then x and y would also be disconnected. But we know PO(x, y), so they share some parts. This contradicts the assumption. So, DC(x, z) is not possible.

2. EC(x, z): If x and z are externally connected (they only touch at their boundaries), and y is completely inside z (NTPP(y, z)), then x and y would not share any interior parts, contradicting PO(x, y). So, EC(x, z) is not possible.

Hmm, I think I made a mistake. Let me reconsider the problem from the beginning.

We have:
- PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap, meaning they share some parts but neither is part of the other.
- NTPP(y, z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

For PO(x, y), this means that there are parts of x that are also parts of y, but there are also parts of x that are not parts of y, and parts of y that are not parts of x.

For NTPP(y, z), this means that y is entirely contained within z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, let's determine what relations are possible between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This means x and z do not share any parts. However, since x shares parts with y, and y is entirely contained within z, x must share parts with z. So, DC(x, z) is not possible.

2. EC(x, z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts. Since x shares interior parts with y, and y is entirely contained within z, x must share interior parts with z. So, EC(x, z) is not possible.

3. PO(x, z): This means x and z partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some parts.

4. TPP(x, z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if all parts of x are also parts of z, and x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x, z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is entirely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if all parts of x are also parts of z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x, z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is entirely contained within x and touches x's boundary. However, since y is entirely contained within z (NTPP(y, z)), and x only partially overlaps with y (PO(x, y)), it's not possible for z to be entirely contained within x. So, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is entirely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Similar to the above, this is not possible because y is entirely contained within z, and x only partially overlaps with y. So, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): This means x and z are equal. If x and z are equal, and y is entirely contained within z, then y would be entirely contained within x. But this contradicts PO(x, y), which states that x and y partially overlap. So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Let me double-check by drawing out a few examples to make sure these are correct:

Example 1: PO(x, z)
Imagine x as a circle that partially overlaps with y, which is a smaller circle completely inside z, a larger circle. The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z, but the rest of x extends outside z, resulting in PO(x, z).

Example 2: TPP(x, z)
Imagine x as a circle that partially overlaps with y, which is a smaller circle completely inside z, a larger circle. x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary, resulting in TPP(x, z).

Example 3: NTPP(x, z)
Imagine x as a circle that partially overlaps with y, which is a smaller circle completely inside z, a much larger circle. x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, resulting in NTPP(x, z).

These examples confirm that PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z) are all possible relations between x and z given PO(x, y) and NTPP(y, z).

Wait, I think I missed something. Let me reconsider more carefully.

Given:
- PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap.
- NTPP(y, z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Let's think about what this means spatially:
- PO(x, y) means there's a region where x and y overlap, but neither is contained within the other.
- NTPP(y, z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): This means x and z don't share any points. But since x shares points with y, and y is inside z, x must share at least some points with z. So, DC(x, z) is not possible.

2. EC(x, z): This means x and z only touch at their boundaries. But since x shares interior points with y, and y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary), x must share interior points with z. So, EC(x, z) is not possible.

3. PO(x, z): This means x and z share some points, but neither is contained within the other. This is possible. Since x partially overlaps with y, and y is inside z, x shares some points with z. And since x has parts that are not in y, it's possible for x to have parts that are not in z, making PO(x, z) a possibility.

4. TPP(x, z): This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible. x can be completely inside z and touch z's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y.

5. NTPP(x, z): This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible. x can be completely inside z and not touch z's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y.

6. TPPi(x, z): This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is completely inside z, if z is completely inside x, then y would also be completely inside x. But this contradicts PO(x, y), which states that neither x nor y is contained within the other. So, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this would imply that y is completely inside x, contradicting PO(x, y). So, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): This means x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y is completely inside z, then y would be completely inside x. But this contradicts PO(x, y). So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Let me double-check with another approach:

Given PO(x, y), there are parts of x that are in y, and parts of x that are not in y. Also, there are parts of y that are in x, and parts of y that are not in x.

Given NTPP(y, z), all of y is inside z, and y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, for the parts of x that are in y, since all of y is inside z, these parts of x are also inside z. For the parts of x that are not in y, they could be inside z or outside z.

If all parts of x (both those in y and those not in y) are inside z, then x is completely inside z, making either TPP(x, z) or NTPP(x, z) true, depending on whether x touches the boundary of z.

If some parts of x that are not in y are outside z, then x is partially inside and partially outside z, making PO(x, z) true.

No other relations are possible because:
- x must share interior points with z (ruling out DC(x, z) and EC(x, z)).
- z cannot be completely inside x (ruling out TPPi(x, z) and NTPPi(x, z)).
- x and z cannot be the same region (ruling out EQ(x, z)).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, let me be extra careful by using a different and perhaps clearer approach. I think there's a slight risk of confusion.

We have:
- PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither is completely inside the other.
- NTPP(y, z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x, z): x and z don't share any parts. But since x shares parts with y, and y is completely inside z, x must share parts with z. So, DC(x, z) is not possible.

2. EC(x, z): x and z only touch at their boundaries, not sharing any interior parts. But since x shares interior parts with y, and y is completely inside z, x must share interior parts with z. So, EC(x, z) is not possible.

3. PO(x, z): x and z share some parts, but neither is completely inside the other. This is possible. We know that x shares parts with y (due to PO(x, y)), and all of y is inside z (due to NTPP(y, z)). But x might also have parts that are not in y and are outside of z. In this case, x and z would partially overlap, with neither being completely inside the other.

4. TPP(x, z): x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible. All parts of x could be inside z, with some parts of x touching the boundary of z. This doesn't contradict PO(x, y), as x can still partially overlap with y while both are inside z.

5. NTPP(x, z): x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is possible. All parts of x could be inside z without touching the boundary of z. Again, this doesn't contradict PO(x, y), as x can still partially overlap with y while both are inside z.

6. TPPi(x, z): z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y is completely inside z (due to NTPP(y, z)), if z is completely inside x, then y would also be completely inside x. But this contradicts PO(x, y), which states that x and y partially overlap without one being completely inside the other. So, TPPi(x, z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x, z): z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. Similar to the above, this would imply that y is completely inside x, contradicting PO(x, y). So, NTPPi(x, z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x, z): x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, and y is completely inside z, then y would be completely inside x. But this contradicts PO(x, y). So, EQ(x, z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: PO(x, z), TPP(x, z), and NTPP(x, z).

The answer is: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze what we know:

1. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some parts but neither is fully contained within the other.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Let me consider each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

- DC(x,z): Not possible. Since x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, x must share at least some points with z.

- EC(x,z): Not possible. Since x shares interior points with y (due to PO), and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x must share interior points with z.

- PO(x,z): Possible. x shares some points with z (the overlap with y), but x can extend outside z in areas where it doesn't overlap with y.

- TPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely contained within z while touching z's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y.

- NTPP(x,z): Possible. x could be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary, while still partially overlapping with y.

- TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were contained within x, then y would be completely contained within x (since y is inside z), contradicting PO(x,y).

- NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. Same reason as TPPi.

- EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x equals z, and y is inside z, then y would be inside x, contradicting PO(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
