PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We are given that:
1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let's consider what EQ(y,z) means: y and z are essentially the same region. This means that any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Since DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts, and y is coincident with z, then x and z must also be disconnected and share no spatial parts.

So the relationship between x and z must be DC(x,z).

Let me double-check:
- DC(x,y): x and y don't overlap or touch.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are identical in terms of spatial extent.

Since y and z occupy exactly the same space, and x is disconnected from y, x must also be disconnected from z.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z given:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)

Since y and z are coincident (EQ relationship), they represent the same spatial region. This means that any spatial relationship that x has with y, x must also have with z.

Given that x is disconnected from y (DC relationship), and z occupies exactly the same space as y, then x must also be disconnected from z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
