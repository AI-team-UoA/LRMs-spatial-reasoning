PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think about what we know:
1. TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

Now I need to figure out the possible relations between x and z.

Since TPP(x,y), x is inside y and touches y's boundary. Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but have no interior overlap.

Let's think about the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? If x touches y's boundary at a part that doesn't touch z, then x and z would be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is a possibility.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries. If x touches y's boundary exactly where y touches z, then x would also touch z at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is a possibility.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. Given that y and z have no interior overlap (they only touch at the boundary), and x is entirely inside y (touching y's boundary), x cannot have any interior overlap with z. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. This isn't possible because x is already contained within y, and y only touches z at the boundary, so x cannot be contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is definitely not possible for the same reason as above.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Since x is already a tangential proper part of y, and y only touches z at the boundary, z cannot be contained within x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is even less possible than TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. This isn't possible because x is contained within y, and z is outside of y (only touching at the boundary).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries

Let me double check this reasoning:

- TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries only

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z, then x and z would be disconnected, giving us DC(x,z).

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z, then x would also touch z at that point, giving us EC(x,z).

These are the only two possibilities.

Actually, wait. Let me try to visualize this more carefully.

- TPP(x,y): x is inside y and touches y's boundary. So x is "almost filling" y, but not quite.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. So they're like two adjacent regions.

Now, where can x be located?

Since x is inside y and touches y's boundary, x could be touching y's boundary at a point where y touches z. In this case, x would also be touching z, giving us EC(x,z).

Alternatively, x could be touching y's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z. In this case, x would be completely separate from z, giving us DC(x,z).

These seem to be the only two possibilities. So the answer is: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z).

Actually, let me just triple check this with a spatial visualization.

TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is completely inside y and touches the boundary of y.
EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. This means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior points.

Given these constraints, let's consider all possible RCC-8 relations for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This can happen if x touches y's boundary at a part that doesn't touch z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries. This can happen if x touches y's boundary exactly where y touches z. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This cannot happen because for x and z to overlap, some part of x would have to be outside of y or some part of z would have to be inside y, both of which contradict our given constraints.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This cannot happen because x is already contained within y, and y only touches z at the boundary, so x cannot be contained within z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This definitely cannot happen for the same reason as above.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This cannot happen because for z to be a part of x, it would have to be completely inside x, which means it would also be inside y, contradicting the EC(y,z) constraint.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This cannot happen for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. This cannot happen because x is inside y and z is outside y (only touching at the boundary), so they cannot be the same region.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relationships between x and z are DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Actually, let me now look to see if I've missed any. Maybe I could use the composition table for RCC-8 to help me, if I remember it correctly.

For TPP(x,y) ∘ EC(y,z), I believe the composition gives DC(x,z) ∪ EC(x,z). So, the possible relationships are indeed:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries

So, the answer is: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (inside y, touching y's boundary)
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected (touching at boundaries only)

Let me analyze the possibilities:

1. Since x is inside y and touches y's boundary, and y only touches z at the boundary, there are two possibilities:

   a) x could touch y's boundary at exactly where y touches z. In this case, x would also touch z at their boundaries, giving us EC(x,z).

   b) x could touch y's boundary at a location where y doesn't touch z. In this case, x and z would have no connection at all, giving us DC(x,z).

2. All other RCC-8 relations are impossible:
   - PO(x,z) is impossible because y and z don't share interior points
   - TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are impossible because x cannot be inside z while being inside y
   - TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because z cannot be inside x while being outside y

### Answer: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)
