PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given that NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's start by understanding what these relations mean:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y) or NTPP(y,x))
- y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z))

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z. Let me think about it step by step.

Given that y is completely inside both x and z, there are several possible configurations for x and z:

1. x and z could be disconnected (DC), but only if there's some part of x that doesn't overlap with z at all. But since y is completely inside both x and z, there must be some overlap between x and z. So DC is not possible.

2. x and z could externally connect (EC), but this would mean that they only touch at their boundaries without any interior overlap. Since y is completely inside both x and z, there must be interior overlap between x and z. So EC is not possible.

3. x and z could partially overlap (PO). This means that there are parts of x not in z, and parts of z not in x, and they share some common part (which includes y). This is a possibility.

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP). This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is a possibility.

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP). This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is a possibility.

6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi). This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is a possibility.

7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi). This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is a possibility.

8. x and z could be equal (EQ). This means x and z are the same region. This is a possibility.

Let me analyze these possibilities more carefully:

For PO(x,z), we have y completely inside both x and z, y touches z's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary. This seems consistent.

For TPP(x,z), we have x completely inside z and touching z's boundary. Since y is inside x and touches z's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, this means x must also touch z's boundary. This seems consistent.

For NTPP(x,z), we have x completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But since y is inside x and touches z's boundary, this would mean y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, which creates a contradiction. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), we have z completely inside x and touching x's boundary. Since y is inside z and doesn't touch x's boundary, this means z must extend beyond y to touch x's boundary. This seems consistent.

For NTPPi(x,z), we have z completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Since y is inside z and doesn't touch x's boundary, this is consistent. But y touches z's boundary, which means z must have some boundary parts that are not close to x's boundary. This seems consistent.

For EQ(x,z), we have x and z as the same region. But y touches z's boundary and doesn't touch x's boundary, which creates a contradiction if x and z are the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider:

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

For PO(x,z), there would be parts of x outside z, parts of z outside x, and they would overlap (at least at y). Since y touches z's boundary, it's possible for x to extend beyond z in some places, and for z to extend beyond x in others. This seems consistent.

For TPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z and touching z's boundary. Since y is inside x and touches z's boundary, it means that x must also touch z's boundary. However, we know that y does not touch x's boundary. If x is touching z's boundary at the same point where y is touching z's boundary, and y is inside x, then y would also be touching x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). So TPP(x,z) seems problematic.

Let me reconsider TPP(x,z) more carefully. TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary, but not necessarily at all points of z's boundary. So y could touch z's boundary at some points, and x could touch z's boundary at other points, without y touching x's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is still possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But y is inside x and touches z's boundary, which would mean y would have to extend to or beyond x's boundary to touch z's boundary. This contradicts NTPPi(x,y), which says y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside x and touching x's boundary. Since y is inside z and y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), z cannot touch x's boundary at a point that's also in y. But z could touch x's boundary at points outside of y. This seems consistent.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. Since y is inside z and doesn't touch x's boundary, this is consistent. But if z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then y must be strictly inside x, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But if y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)) and y doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), then x and z cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, I think I've been misinterpreting the constraints. Let me revisit them.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

So we have:
- y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

For DC(x,z), x and z would be disconnected. But since y is inside both x and z, x and z must overlap at least at y. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), x and z would only touch at their boundaries without interior overlap. But since y is inside both x and z, x and z must have interior overlap. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z), x and z would partially overlap, with parts of x outside z, parts of z outside x, and a common part (which includes y). This seems consistent with the constraints.

For TPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z and touching z's boundary. If y touches z's boundary at some point, and x extends to z's boundary at that point or another point, this doesn't contradict y being completely inside x without touching x's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. But since y is inside x and touches z's boundary, x would have to extend to z's boundary where y touches it, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside x and touching x's boundary. Since y is inside z and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z must not touch x's boundary at any point inside y. But z could touch x's boundary at points outside of y. This is consistent.

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This means y is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary, which is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). But y touches z's boundary, which is also consistent since z's boundary is inside x. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would be the same region. But if y touches z's boundary and doesn't touch x's boundary, and x and z are the same, we have a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, let me try to be even more careful and use a graphical approach.

First, for NTPPi(x,y) or NTPP(y,x), we have y completely inside x, not touching x's boundary:
```
   x
 +-----+
 |     |
 |  y  |
 | +-+ |
 | | | |
 | +-+ |
 |     |
 +-----+
```

For TPP(y,z), we have y completely inside z, touching z's boundary:
```
   z
 +-----+
 |     |
 |  y  |
 | +-+-+
 | | | |
 | +-+ |
 |     |
 +-----+
```

Now let's combine these visualizations to see the possible relationships between x and z:

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap:
```
   x        z
 +-----+ +-----+
 |     | |     |
 |  y  | |  y  |
 | +-+-+-+-+-+ |
 | | | | | | | |
 | +-+ | +-+ | |
 |     | |     |
 +-----+ +-----+
```
This works because y can be inside both x and z, touching z's boundary but not x's boundary.

For TPP(x,z), x is completely inside z, touching z's boundary:
```
     z
   +-----+
   |     |
   |  x  |
   | +---+-+
   | |   | |
   | | y | |
   | | +-+ |
   | | | | |
   | | +-+ |
   | |     |
   | +-----+
   |       |
   +-------+
```
This works because y can be inside x, which is inside z, with y touching z's boundary but not x's boundary, and x touching z's boundary at other points.

Let me check. Actually I am pretty sure I made an error. Let me redraw this. For TPP(x,z), I need a picture showing that y is inside both x and z, and y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary. This means the boundary of x at y is strictly inside z, but x can touch z's boundary at other locations:

```
      z
   +-------+
   |       |
   |   x   |
   | +---+ |
   | |   | |
   | | y | |
   | | +-+-+
   | | | | |
   | | +-+ |
   | |     |
   | +-----+
   |       |
   +-------+
```

For TPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x, touching x's boundary:
```
     x
   +-------+
   |       |
   |   z   |
   | +-----+
   | |     |
   | |  y  |
   | | +-+-+
   | | | | |
   | | +-+ |
   | |     |
   | +-----+
   |       |
   +-------+
```
This works because y can be inside z, which is inside x, with y touching z's boundary but not x's boundary, and z touching x's boundary at points outside of y.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary:
```
     x
   +-------+
   |       |
   |       |
   |   z   |
   | +-----+
   | |     |
   | |  y  |
   | | +-+-+
   | | | | |
   | | +-+ |
   | |     |
   | +-----+
   |       |
   +-------+
```
This works because y can be inside z, which is inside x, with y touching z's boundary but neither y nor z touching x's boundary.

So, based on this graphical analysis, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I think we should consider again NTPP(x,z), which means x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. I said this is not possible because y, which is inside x, touches z's boundary. But let me reconsider.

For NTPP(x,z), x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If y is inside x and touches z's boundary, x would also have to extend to z's boundary at that point, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

So, the final answer is that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I think I need to be more careful here. Let me go through each case one more time.

For PO(x,z), x and z partially overlap. This means that there's some part of x outside z, some part of z outside x, and they have a common part (which includes y). Since y is inside both x and z, and y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, this is consistent with PO(x,z). So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z), x is completely inside z, touching z's boundary. This means y is also inside z. Since y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)) and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), this is consistent with TPP(x,z). So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z), x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This means y is also inside z. But since y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)), and y is inside x, x would have to extend to z's boundary where y touches it, which contradicts NTPP(x,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x, touching x's boundary. This means y is also inside x. Since y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)) and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), z must not touch x's boundary at any point inside y. But z could touch x's boundary at points outside of y. This is consistent with TPPi(x,z). So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This means y is also inside x. Since y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)) and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), this is consistent with NTPPi(x,z). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

For EQ(x,z), x and z are the same region. But if y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)) and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)), and x and z are the same, we have a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

For DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), x and z would not have an interior overlap. But since y is inside both x and z, x and z must have an interior overlap. So DC(x,z) and EC(x,z) are not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what happens when NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are true, and determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let me understand what these given relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Now I'll examine each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because y is inside both x and z, so they must overlap.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because y creates interior overlap between x and z.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can partially overlap, with y in their common region, touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be completely inside z and touch z's boundary, while y is inside x, touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y (which is inside x) couldn't touch z's boundary either.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x and touch x's boundary, with y inside z, touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, with y inside z, touching z's boundary but not touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y touching z's boundary would mean y also touches x's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(x,y).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
