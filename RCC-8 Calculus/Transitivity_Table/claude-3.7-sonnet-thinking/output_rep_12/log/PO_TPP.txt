PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relations that could hold between x and z given that PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let's think step by step:

- PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap. They share some parts, but neither is completely contained in the other.
- TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. That is, y is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary.

Now I need to consider what these two facts together imply about the possible relation between x and z.

Since y is a proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), z contains all of y. And since x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), x shares some parts with y. Therefore, x must share at least some parts with z as well (the parts that x shares with y). But beyond that, there are several possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): This is not possible because x and y share parts, and y is completely within z, so x and z must share at least some parts (the parts x shares with y).

2. EC(x,z): This might be possible if x overlaps with y only in the part where y touches the boundary of z. In this case, x would touch z's boundary without sharing interior parts with z.

Actually, that doesn't quite work. If x partially overlaps with y, then they share interior parts. And if y is completely contained within z, then any interior parts of y are also interior parts of z. So x must share interior parts with z, which means EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x could share some parts with z (at least the parts it shares with y) but not be completely contained in z.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x could be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. x could be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since y is a proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, x cannot completely contain z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, this would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is not possible for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since y is a proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, x cannot be the same as z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning for each case:

1. DC(x,z): x and y share parts (from PO(x,y)), and y is completely within z (from TPP(y,z)), so x and z must share at least some parts. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x partially overlaps with y, then they share interior parts. And if y is completely contained within z, then any interior parts of y are also interior parts of z. So x must share interior parts with z, which means EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I need to be more careful here. If y touches the boundary of z (which is the case with TPP(y,z)), and x overlaps with y only in the parts where y touches the boundary of z, then it's possible that x touches z without sharing interior parts. So EC(x,z) might be possible.

Actually no, let me think about this more carefully. PO(x,y) means x and y share interior parts. TPP(y,z) means all of y is inside z, and y touches the boundary of z. So the parts that x and y share are inside z. This means x and z share interior parts, which rules out both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x shares interior parts with z (the parts it shares with y), but x might extend beyond z as well.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x could be completely contained within z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. x could be completely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. But since y is a proper part of z (from TPP(y,z)), and x partially overlaps with y (from PO(x,y)), x cannot completely contain z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similarly, this would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is not possible for the same reason as above.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since y is a proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, x cannot be the same as z. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me recheck the reasoning for EC(x,z).

PO(x,y) means x and y share interior parts.
TPP(y,z) means all of y is inside z, and y touches the boundary of z.

The parts that x and y share are interior parts of both x and y. Since all of y is inside z, these shared parts are also interior parts of z. This means x and z share interior parts, which rules out both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

I think my reasoning is correct, but let me double-check with some concrete examples or visualizations to make sure.

Imagine y as a smaller circle inside a larger circle z, with y touching the boundary of z at a point. Now, x partially overlaps with y, meaning x and y share some region. This shared region is inside z, which means x and z share some region as well. Therefore, x and z either partially overlap (PO) or x is contained in z (TPP or NTPP), depending on how much of x extends beyond y.

Let me check EC(x,z) one more time with a visual example. If y is a circle touching the boundary of z, and x is another circle that overlaps with y precisely at the point where y touches the boundary of z, then x and z would be externally connected (EC). But this scenario is impossible because PO(x,y) requires x and y to share interior parts, not just a boundary point.

Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I need to be more precise. Let's say y is a circle touching the boundary of z. The fact that y touches the boundary of z means there's a point p that's on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z. Now, for PO(x,y), x and y must share interior points. Let's say x is a circle that overlaps with y, sharing some interior points. If x also contains the point p, then x and z would share the point p. But p is on the boundary of z, not in its interior, so x and z wouldn't share interior points, which means EC(x,z) would be the relation.

Actually, I realize I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me be more precise.

PO(x,y) means x and y share interior points, but neither is contained in the other. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, which means all of y is inside z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, the interior points that x and y share are inside y, and since all of y is inside z, these shared interior points are also inside z. This means x and z share interior points, which rules out both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

However, I need to consider all possible ways x and y can partially overlap, and how y can be a tangential proper part of z. There might be cases where x and z are externally connected.

Actually, I think I've been correct all along. Let me be very clear:

- PO(x,y) means x and y share interior points.
- TPP(y,z) means all of y is inside z, and y touches the boundary of z.

The interior points that x and y share are inside y, and since all of y is inside z, these shared interior points are also inside z. This means x and z share interior points, which rules out both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

Let's think more systematically. Since PO(x,y), a portion of x is inside y. Since TPP(y,z), all of y is inside z. Therefore, a portion of x is inside z. This rules out DC(x,z), EC(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z). The remaining possibilities are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's verify with examples that each of these is possible:

PO(x,z): Imagine y is a small circle touching the boundary of a larger circle z. x is a circle that partially overlaps with y and extends beyond z. Here, x partially overlaps with z.

TPP(x,z): Imagine y is a small circle touching the boundary of a larger circle z. x is a circle that partially overlaps with y but is completely contained within z, and x also touches the boundary of z. Here, x is a tangential proper part of z.

NTPP(x,z): Imagine y is a small circle touching the boundary of a larger circle z. x is a circle that partially overlaps with y but is completely contained within z, and x does not touch the boundary of z. Here, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

This confirms that the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually wait. EC(x,z) would mean x and z share a boundary, but no interior. But since x and y overlap, they have shared interior (not just a shared boundary). And since y is fully within z (TPP(y,z)), those shared x/y interior points are also interior points of z. That means that x and z share interior points, which rules out EC.

I had a lingering doubt about EC(x,z), but I've convinced myself now that it's not possible.

Given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let me understand what we know:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap, sharing some interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is completely contained in z and touches z's boundary

What does this tell us about x and z?

Since x shares interior parts with y (from PO(x,y)), and all of y is inside z (from TPP(y,z)), this means x must share some interior parts with z. This immediately rules out:
- DC(x,z) - impossible because x must share parts with z
- EC(x,z) - impossible because x shares interior parts with z, not just boundary

Since y is contained in z but x only partially overlaps with y, x could extend beyond z. This means:
- PO(x,z) is possible - x could share parts with z but extend outside z

It's also possible that x is completely contained within z, either:
- TPP(x,z) is possible - x could be completely inside z while touching z's boundary
- NTPP(x,z) is possible - x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary

The relations TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are impossible because x cannot completely contain z when it only partially overlaps with y, which is itself contained in z.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
