PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the relationships:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So, we have:
- y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- y is completely inside z (not touching z's boundary)

Now we need to figure out the possible relationships between x and z. Let's consider each of the 8 relationships:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the part that is y. So DC is not a possible relationship.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This is not possible either because y is an interior part of both x and z (since y doesn't touch the boundary of either x or z). So EC is not a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x extends beyond z in some areas, and z extends beyond x in other areas, with y being in the overlap region. So PO is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, while y is inside both and doesn't touch the boundary of either. So TPP is a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, while y is inside x. So NTPP is a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is inside x and touches x's boundary, while y is inside both and doesn't touch the boundary of either. So TPPi is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, while y is inside z. So NTPPi is a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy the same space. This is possible if x and z are the same region, with y being inside both. So EQ is a possible relationship.

Wait, let me reconsider this carefully.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. That means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. That means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's analyze what these relationships tell us about the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- y is completely contained within x, away from x's boundary.
- y is completely contained within z, away from z's boundary.

Let's analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, then there's no spatial overlap between them. But we know that y is a part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the region occupied by y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z are externally connected, they only touch at their boundaries and don't share any interior points. But we know that y, which is an interior part of both x and z, is shared between them. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points but each also has some parts that are not shared with the other. Given our constraints, this is a possible relationship. x and z share the region occupied by y, but x might extend beyond z in some areas, and z might extend beyond x in others.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given our constraints, this is a possible relationship. y is contained within both x and z, x is completely contained within z, and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given our constraints, this is a possible relationship. y is contained within both x and z, x is completely contained within z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. Given our constraints, this is a possible relationship. y is contained within both x and z, z is completely contained within x, and z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given our constraints, this is a possible relationship. y is contained within both x and z, z is completely contained within x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, they occupy exactly the same space. Given our constraints, this is a possible relationship. y is contained within both x and z, and x and z occupy the same space.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Wait, let me double-check this again, because there's a key constraint I haven't fully explored: the relationship between y and the boundaries of x and z.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. So y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let me reconsider each of the possible relationships between x and z:

1. PO(x,z): In this case, x and z partially overlap. Now, we know that y is completely inside both x and z. But is it possible for x and z to have a partial overlap while both completely containing y? Yes, it's possible. We can have a situation where y is in the overlap region of x and z, with both x and z extending beyond this overlap in different directions. So PO(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship.

2. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. If x touches the boundary of z, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y is also completely inside z without touching z's boundary (which satisfies our NTPP(y,z) condition). So TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

3. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, and y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then y is also completely inside z without touching z's boundary (which satisfies our NTPP(y,z) condition). So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z touches the boundary of x, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary (which satisfies our NTPPi(x,y) condition). So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then y is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary (which satisfies our NTPPi(x,y) condition). So NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

6. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. If x and z are the same region, and y is completely inside this region without touching its boundary, then both NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) are satisfied. So EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. I believe I missed a subtle point. When we have two regions with some specific relationship, and we introduce a third region with specific relationships to the first two, it might constrain the possible relationships between the first two more than I initially thought.

Let's go through this again:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

NTPP(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

So we have:
1. y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's analyze each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): If x and z are disconnected, they don't share any points. But we know y is a part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the points that make up y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): If x and z are externally connected, they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. But we know y is an interior part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): If x and z partially overlap, they share some interior points (which would include y) and each has some parts that are not shared with the other. This relationship is consistent with our constraints.

4. TPP(x,z): If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. This relationship is consistent with our constraints, as y can be completely inside x (and thus inside z) without touching the boundary of either.

5. NTPP(x,z): If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This relationship is consistent with our constraints, as y can be completely inside x (and thus inside z) without touching the boundary of either.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary. This relationship is consistent with our constraints, as y can be completely inside z (and thus inside x) without touching the boundary of either.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This relationship is consistent with our constraints, as y can be completely inside z (and thus inside x) without touching the boundary of either.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, they occupy exactly the same space. This relationship is consistent with our constraints, as y can be completely inside both x and z (which are the same region) without touching the boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

But wait, I need to be more careful. Let's ensure I'm considering all the constraints correctly.

When we say NTPPi(x,y), it means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

When we say NTPP(y,z), it means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider each possible relationship between x and z and see if it's consistent with these two constraints:

1. PO(x,z): In this case, x and z partially overlap. Both x and z contain y completely, and y doesn't touch the boundary of either. This is possible if y is in the overlapping region of x and z. So PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

2. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. So x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. We know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since x is inside z, y is also inside z. And since y doesn't touch x's boundary (which touches z's boundary), y doesn't touch z's boundary either. So TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

3. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. So x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. We know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since x is inside z, y is also inside z. And since x doesn't touch z's boundary, y doesn't touch z's boundary either. So NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. So z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. We know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. We also know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that z touches x's boundary, is it possible for y to be inside z without touching z's boundary, and also inside x without touching x's boundary? Yes, as long as y is in the interior of z, away from the part of z that touches x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. So z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. We know that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. We also know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. These constraints are all consistent, so NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

6. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same region. We know that y is completely inside x (and therefore z) and doesn't touch x's (and therefore z's) boundary. These constraints are consistent, so EQ(x,z) is a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are still:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let me try to create a visual representation of each scenario to check if my reasoning is correct:

1. PO(x,z):
Imagine x as a circle on the left and z as a circle on the right, with a partial overlap in the middle. The region y is a smaller circle completely inside the overlap region. This way, y is completely inside both x and z, doesn't touch the boundary of either, and x and z partially overlap.

2. TPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a large circle and x as a smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary. The region y is an even smaller circle completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This way, y is completely inside both x and z, doesn't touch the boundary of either, and x is a tangential proper part of z.

3. NTPP(x,z):
Imagine z as a large circle and x as a smaller circle inside z, not touching z's boundary. The region y is an even smaller circle completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This way, y is completely inside both x and z, doesn't touch the boundary of either, and x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

4. TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a large circle and z as a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary. The region y is an even smaller circle completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This way, y is completely inside both x and z, doesn't touch the boundary of either, and z is a tangential proper part of x.

5. NTPPi(x,z):
Imagine x as a large circle and z as a smaller circle inside x, not touching x's boundary. The region y is an even smaller circle completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. This way, y is completely inside both x and z, doesn't touch the boundary of either, and z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

6. EQ(x,z):
Imagine x and z as the same circle, and y as a smaller circle completely inside, not touching the boundary. This way, y is completely inside both x and z, doesn't touch the boundary of either, and x and z are equal.

Yep, all these scenarios are geometrically possible, so my answer stands.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Let me do a final check to make sure I'm not missing anything. We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, consider each relationship in RCC-8 for x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because y is a part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the part that is y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is not possible because y is an interior part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior points.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Both contain y completely, and y doesn't touch the boundary of either. This is possible if y is in the overlapping region of x and z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since x is inside z, y is also inside z. And since y doesn't touch x's boundary (which touches z's boundary), y doesn't touch z's boundary either.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since x is inside z, y is also inside z. And since x doesn't touch z's boundary, y doesn't touch z's boundary either.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since z is inside x, y is also inside x. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary (and z touches x's boundary at a specific point or region), y doesn't touch x's boundary either.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since z is inside x, y is also inside x. And since z doesn't touch x's boundary, y doesn't touch x's boundary either.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. y is completely inside this region and doesn't touch its boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

Actually, let's think of it this way, using the composition table for RCC-8 relations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_connection_calculus

We want to compute the composition NTPPi ◦ NTPP. 

From the table, the result of NTPPi ◦ NTPP is {PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ}.

That's the same result I got through my reasoning! So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)
- EQ(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships can hold between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

First, let me understand what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary)
- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary)

I'll analyze each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible because y is part of both x and z, so they must share at least the region y.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible because y is an interior part of both x and z, so they must share interior points, not just boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap with y in the overlapping region.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z and touching z's boundary, with y inside x.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be completely inside z without touching z's boundary, with y inside x.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be completely inside x and touching x's boundary, with y inside z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, with y inside z.

8. EQ(x,z): Possible - x and z can be the same region, with y inside both.
