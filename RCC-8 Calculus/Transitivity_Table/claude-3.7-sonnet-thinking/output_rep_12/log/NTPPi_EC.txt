PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.

Now I need to figure out what the possible relationships between x and z could be.

Given that y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, let's consider the possibilities:

1. Could z be disconnected from x? If z only touches y's boundary but doesn't extend beyond it, and y is completely inside x, then z would have to be completely inside x as well. So z cannot be disconnected from x, meaning DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. Could z be externally connected to x? If z touches y's boundary and extends outward to touch x's boundary (but doesn't penetrate x's interior beyond y), then z and x would be externally connected. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. Could z partially overlap with x? If z touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x, then z and x would partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. Could z be a tangential proper part of x? If z touches y's boundary but is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary, then z would be a tangential proper part of x. So TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x? If z touches y's boundary but is completely contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. Could x be a tangential proper part of z? If z touches y's boundary and contains all of x (including y), touching x's boundary, then x would be a tangential proper part of z. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z? If z touches y's boundary and completely contains x (including y) such that x doesn't touch z's boundary, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. Could x and z be equal? If z touches y's boundary, it can't be equal to x because x completely contains y. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check my reasoning by considering some examples or cases:

Case 1: Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a circle that touches y's boundary. If z is small enough to be completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then NTPP(z,x) holds.

Case 2: If z is larger and touches both y's boundary and x's boundary from the inside, then TPP(z,x) holds.

Case 3: If z extends both inside and outside of x, touching y's boundary, then PO(x,z) holds.

Case 4: If z touches y's boundary from the outside of x and also touches x's boundary from the outside, then EC(x,z) holds.

Case 5: If z is very large, containing all of x and touching y's boundary, such that x touches z's boundary, then TPPi(x,z) holds.

Case 6: If z is even larger, containing all of x such that x doesn't touch z's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z) holds.

Oh wait, I need to be more careful in my reasoning. Let me reconsider some of these cases.

Since NTPPi(x,y), y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
Since EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's work through the possibilities more carefully:

1. Could z be disconnected from x (DC(x,z))? 
   Since y is inside x and z touches y's boundary, z must at least touch x's interior. So z cannot be disconnected from x. DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. Could z be externally connected to x (EC(x,z))?
   For this to be true, z would need to touch x's boundary but not share any interior points with x. But since z touches y's boundary and y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), z must overlap with at least some part of x's interior. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. Could z partially overlap with x (PO(x,z))?
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x))?
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary. So TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x))?
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and doesn't touch x's boundary. So NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPPi(x,z))?
   This is possible if z contains all of x (including y), touches y's boundary, and x touches z's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPPi(x,z))?
   This is possible if z contains all of x (including y), touches y's boundary, and x doesn't touch z's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. Could x and z be equal (EQ(x,z))?
   For this to be true, x and z would need to be coincident. But z touches y's boundary, and y is properly inside x, so z and x cannot be equal. EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me reconsider EC(x,z) again. Since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, z must penetrate into x's interior. This means z shares some interior points with x, so they cannot be externally connected. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I need to be very careful here. Let me reconsider each case by visualizing specific examples:

1. DC(x,z): If y is completely inside x and z only touches y's boundary, then z must at least touch x's interior. So z cannot be disconnected from x. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would require z to touch only x's boundary without sharing interior points. But since z touches y's boundary and y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), z must share some interior points with x. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): If z touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x, then z and x would partially overlap. This is a valid configuration. Therefore, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(z,x): If z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary, then z would be a tangential proper part of x. This is a valid configuration. Therefore, TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): If z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. This is a valid configuration. Therefore, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): If z touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x touches z's boundary, then x would be a tangential proper part of z. This is a valid configuration. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, then x would be a non-tangential proper part of z. This is a valid configuration. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If z touches y's boundary and y is properly inside x, then z must differ from x. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check my reasoning one more time.

I know that:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): 
   Since y is inside x and z touches y's boundary, z must intersect with x's interior. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z):
   For this to be true, z would only touch x's boundary without sharing interior points. But since z touches y's boundary and y is strictly inside x, z must share some interior points with x. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x, creating a partial overlap. Therefore, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(z,x):
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary. Therefore, TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. NTPP(z,x):
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x touches z's boundary. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z):
   Since z touches y's boundary and y is a proper part of x, z and x cannot be equal. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Oh wait, I think I need to reconsider the PO(x,z) case more carefully. Given that:
- y is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- z touches y's boundary but doesn't overlap with y

I need to consider whether z could partially overlap with x. If z extends outside of x, then it would partially overlap with x. This is indeed possible - z could touch y's boundary and extend both inside and outside of x.

Let me make sure I'm being precise with each relation by considering specific examples:

1. PO(x,z): Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a shape that touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x. In this case, z and x partially overlap.

2. TPP(z,x): Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a shape that touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x.

3. NTPP(z,x): Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a small shape that touches y's boundary and is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

4. TPPi(x,z): Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a larger shape that touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x touches z's boundary. In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPPi(x,z): Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a much larger shape that touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary. In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

These all seem valid, so I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me think a bit more about the DC(x,z) case. I've been assuming that since z touches y's boundary and y is inside x, z must at least touch x's interior. But what if z is just a single point that touches y's boundary exactly at a point? Then z would still be disconnected from x.

No, that doesn't work either. If z touches y's boundary at a point, and y is inside x, then that point is inside x, so z and x share at least that point. So DC(x,z) is still not possible.

And for EC(x,z), I've been assuming that since y is strictly inside x and z touches y's boundary, z must share some interior points with x. But what if z just touches y's boundary at a single point? Could it then be that z otherwise stays outside of x and only touches x's boundary?

No, that doesn't work either. If z touches y's boundary at a point, that point is inside x's interior (not on x's boundary), so z and x share an interior point of x. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

I believe my final answer is correct:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me just check that these relationships are all valid by visualizing examples:

1. PO(x,z): x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a shape that touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x.

2. TPP(z,x): x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a shape that touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary.

3. NTPP(z,x): x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a small shape that touches y's boundary and is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary.

4. TPPi(x,z): x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a larger shape that touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPPi(x,z): x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a much larger shape that touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary.

These all seem valid, so I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I've been rushing this. Let me step back and consider each case more carefully.

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x): y is a proper part of x (y is completely contained within x) and y does not touch x's boundary.

EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Since y is inside x and z touches y's boundary, z must touch or overlap with x's interior. So x and z cannot be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
   Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, z must penetrate into x's interior. So x and z must share interior points, which means they cannot be externally connected. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x. Therefore, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary. Therefore, TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)).
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x touches z's boundary. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)).
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   Since z touches y's boundary and y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), z must differ from x. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, actually I think I've been making a subtle error in my reasoning. Let me reconsider each case one more time.

We know:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

I need to consider what this means more carefully:
- Since y is completely inside x, y's boundary is also completely inside x.
- Since z touches y's boundary but doesn't overlap with y, z must at least penetrate into x's interior.

Now let's carefully consider each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   Since z touches y's boundary and y is inside x, z must at least touch x's interior. So x and z cannot be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
   Since z touches y's boundary and y is completely inside x (including y's boundary), z must penetrate into x's interior. So x and z must share interior points, which means they cannot be externally connected. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x, creating a partial overlap. Therefore, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary. Therefore, TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x touches z's boundary. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if z touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   Since z touches y's boundary and y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), z must differ from x. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I believe this analysis is correct. Let me verify one more time by visualizing concrete examples:

1. PO(x,z): Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a shape that touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x. In this case, z and x partially overlap, sharing some interior points but neither is contained in the other.

2. TPP(z,x): Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a shape that touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary. Here, z is a tangential proper part of x.

3. NTPP(z,x): Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a small shape that touches y's boundary and is completely contained within x without touching x's boundary. Here, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

4. TPPi(x,z): Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a larger shape that touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x touches z's boundary. Here, x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPPi(x,z): Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a much larger shape that touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary. Here, x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

These all seem valid, so I confirm that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me take a step back and think about each of these relations more carefully again, because I want to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's consider each relation:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Since z touches y's boundary and y is inside x, z must at least touch x's interior. So x and z cannot be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Since z touches y's boundary and y is completely inside x (including y's boundary), z must penetrate into x's interior. So x and z must share interior points, which means they cannot be externally connected. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x. Therefore, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(z,x): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary. Therefore, TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x touches z's boundary. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if z touches y's boundary, completely contains x, and x doesn't touch z's boundary. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. Since z touches y's boundary and y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), z must differ from x. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I've double-checked my reasoning and I believe this is the correct answer.

Actually, I just realized one more thing to check. In the case of TPPi(x,z), where x is a tangential proper part of z, can z touch y's boundary? Let's think about this. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then z completely contains x and x touches z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But we know that z touches y's boundary, which contradicts what we just deduced. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not actually possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), where x is a non-tangential proper part of z, can z touch y's boundary? If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then z completely contains x and x doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But we know that z touches y's boundary, which is a contradiction. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible either.

Let me reconsider these cases more carefully:

For TPPi(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z and touches z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But we're given that z touches y's boundary, which contradicts our deduction. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But we're given that z touches y's boundary, which contradicts our deduction. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Wait, I think I may have been overthinking this. Let me start over with clear visualizations.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Let's consider each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z don't share any points. But since z touches y's boundary and y is inside x, z must at least touch x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. Given that z touches y's boundary and y is completely inside x, z must penetrate into x's interior. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. If z touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x, then x and z partially overlap. This is possible.

4. TPP(z,x): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. If z touches y's boundary, is completely inside x, and also touches x's boundary, then z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. If z touches y's boundary, is completely inside x, and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible.

Now for TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), let me be very careful:

6. TPPi(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. 
   If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x, y is also completely inside z. But can z touch y's boundary in this case? 
   
   Actually, yes it can. Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a larger circle that contains x, with x touching z's boundary. Now imagine z has a "dent" or "inward protrusion" that reaches in to touch y's boundary. In this case, x is a tangential proper part of z, and z touches y's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x, y is also completely inside z. But can z touch y's boundary in this case?
   
   Again, yes it can. Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a much larger circle that completely contains x, with x not touching z's boundary. Now imagine z has a "tentacle" or "inward protrusion" that reaches in to touch y's boundary without touching x's boundary. In this case, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and z touches y's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. If x and z are equal, then z must have exactly the same boundary as x. But since z touches y's boundary and y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary), z must differ from x. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I need to be more precise about what it means for regions to "touch" in this context. In RCC-8, when we say two regions touch, we mean they share a boundary point but no interior points. So when we say EC(y,z), y and z share a boundary point but no interior points.

Given this, let me reconsider the TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) cases:

For TPPi(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Can z touch y's boundary in this case?

I think I made an error before. If y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then y must be strictly inside z and cannot touch z's boundary. But EC(y,z) says that y and z touch at their boundaries. This is a contradiction, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is also completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Can z touch y's boundary in this case?

Again, if y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y must be strictly inside z and cannot touch z's boundary. But EC(y,z) says that y and z touch at their boundaries. This is a contradiction, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Wait, I think I've been making this way too complicated. Let me simplify my approach and visualize the problem more directly.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

In simpler terms:
- y is completely inside x, away from x's boundary.
- z touches y's boundary from the outside (they share a boundary point but no interior).

Since z touches y's boundary from the outside, and y is inside x, z must penetrate into x to some extent. The question is: what are the possible spatial relationships between x and z?

Let's consider each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? No, because z touches y's boundary and y is inside x, so z must intersect with x. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected? No, because z touches y's boundary and y is inside x, so z must share some interior points with x. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? Yes, if z touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x. Therefore, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(z,x): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary. Therefore, TPP(z,x) is possible.

5. NTPP(z,x): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, if z touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, NTPP(z,x) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? No, because if x is completely inside z and y is completely inside x, then y must be completely inside z. But EC(y,z) says that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is a contradiction, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, for the same reason as TPPi(x,z). If x is completely inside z and y is completely inside x, then y must be completely inside z. But EC(y,z) says that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is a contradiction, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? No, because if x and z are equal, then z's boundary is the same as x's boundary. But EC(y,z) says that y and z touch at their boundaries, and NTPPi(x,y) says that y doesn't touch x's boundary. This is a contradiction, so EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Wait, I think I got confused in my last analysis of TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me break it down step-by-step with precise definitions.

For TPPi(x,z), which means TPP(z,x):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, then:
1. x is a proper part of z (x is completely contained in z)
2. x touches z's boundary

For NTPPi(x,z), which means NTPP(z,x):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then:
1. x is a proper part of z (x is completely contained in z)
2. x does not touch z's boundary

Now, given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected

For TPPi(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then y is a proper part of z (by transitivity of the part-of relation). Since y doesn't touch x's boundary and x is strictly inside z, y doesn't touch z's boundary either. But EC(y,z) says that y and z touch at their boundaries. This is a contradiction, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, then y is a proper part of z (by transitivity). Since y doesn't touch x's boundary and x doesn't touch z's boundary, y doesn't touch z's boundary either. But EC(y,z) says that y and z touch at their boundaries. This is a contradiction, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Actually, let me double-check if TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are truly impossible with a concrete example, because I'm now doubting myself.

For TPPi(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a larger circle that contains x, with x touching z's boundary. Can z touch y's boundary in this configuration?

No, it can't. If x is tangentially inside z, and y is non-tangentially inside x, then y must be strictly inside z without touching z's boundary. But EC(y,z) requires y and z to touch at their boundaries. This is a contradiction, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z):
Imagine x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a much larger circle that completely contains x, with x not touching z's boundary. Can z touch y's boundary in this configuration?

No, it can't. If x is non-tangentially inside z, and y is non-tangentially inside x, then y must be strictly inside z without touching z's boundary. But EC(y,z) requires y and z to touch at their boundaries. This is a contradiction, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, if I shift my mental picture, I can see a configuration where z could be a deformed shape that reaches in to touch y's boundary while still containing all of x. But that would violate the condition that z is externally connected to y, as it would contain part of y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Actually, I realize I've been overthinking this problem. Let me simplify my approach and reason more directly.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

The key insight is that z touches y's boundary, and y's boundary is entirely inside x (not touching x's boundary). This means z must penetrate into x to some extent.

The possible configurations are:
1. z is partly inside x and partly outside x. This gives PO(x,z).
2. z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This gives TPP(z,x).
3. z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This gives NTPP(z,x).

Why can't x be inside z? If x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x). But EC(y,z) says that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is a contradiction because if y is inside z, then y and z share interior points.

Why can't x and z be equal? If x and z are equal, then z's boundary is the same as x's boundary. But y doesn't touch x's boundary, so y can't touch z's boundary. This contradicts EC(y,z).

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

Let me double-check by visualizing a clear example for each case:

1. PO(x,z): x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a shape that touches y's boundary and extends both inside and outside of x.

2. TPP(z,x): x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a shape that touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and also touches x's boundary.

3. NTPP(z,x): x is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z is a shape that touches y's boundary, is completely contained within x, and doesn't touch x's boundary.

These all seem valid, so I believe the correct answer is:
The possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(z,x)
- NTPP(z,x)

I realize that the answer to this type of problem depends crucially on what it means for regions to "touch" or be "externally connected" in the RCC-8 calculus. In RCC-8, when we say two regions are externally connected (EC), they share boundary points but no interior points. With this precise understanding, I believe my final answer is correct.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is completely inside x without touching x's boundary
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points

Let's analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since z touches y's boundary and y is inside x, z must intersect with x.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. Since z touches y's boundary and y is strictly inside x, z must share some interior points with x.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. z can touch y's boundary and extend both inside and outside of x, creating a partial overlap.

4. TPP(z,x): Possible. z can touch y's boundary, be completely contained within x, and also touch x's boundary.

5. NTPP(z,x): Possible. z can touch y's boundary, be completely contained within x, and not touch x's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If x were inside z, then y would also be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi - y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were equal, then z couldn't touch y's boundary since y doesn't touch x's boundary.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), NTPP(z,x)
