PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the information given:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since TPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper part of y. 
Since TPP(y,z), we know that y is a proper part of z.

So, x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z. This implies that x is also a proper part of z, since the "part of" relation is transitive.

Now, let's determine whether x touches the boundary of z.

We know that x touches the boundary of y (from TPP(x,y)), and y touches the boundary of z (from TPP(y,z)). There are two possibilities:
1. x touches the boundary of z directly, in which case TPP(x,z).
2. x is completely contained within z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, in which case NTPP(x,z).

Let's confirm these possibilities by drawing some simple examples.

Scenario 1: TPP(x,z)
x is a circle, y is a larger circle that contains x, and z is an even larger circle that contains y. If x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, and x also touches the boundary of z at the same point, then TPP(x,z).

Scenario 2: NTPP(x,z)
x is a circle, y is a larger circle that contains x, and z is an even larger circle that contains y. If x touches the boundary of y at a point that is not on the boundary of z, then x doesn't touch the boundary of z, making NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. Let's revisit the definitions:
- TPP(x,y) means that x is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, i.e., x is a proper part of y and x does not touch the boundary of y.

Given TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), we know that:
1. x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
2. y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, by transitivity, x is a proper part of z.
2. Whether x touches the boundary of z depends on the specific arrangement. If x touches the boundary of y at a point that is also on the boundary of z, then x touches the boundary of z, and TPP(x,z). If x touches the boundary of y only at points that are in the interior of z, then x doesn't touch the boundary of z, and NTPP(x,z).

I believe both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible. Let's double-check by considering specific scenarios:

Imagine z as a large square, y as a smaller square inside z such that one edge of y aligns with one edge of z, and x as an even smaller square inside y such that:
- In one case, one edge of x aligns with the common edge of y and z. In this case, x touches the boundary of z, so TPP(x,z).
- In another case, x is positioned such that it touches the boundary of y at a non-shared part with z. In this case, x is completely in the interior of z and doesn't touch its boundary, so NTPP(x,z).

I'm confident that both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me do a bit more double checking here. Given TPP(x,y), x must touch the boundary of y. Given TPP(y,z), y must touch the boundary of z. Now, for TPP(x,z) to be true, x must touch the boundary of z. For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must not touch the boundary of z.

Let's visualize:
- TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must touch the boundary of z. This can happen if x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z.
- NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must not touch the boundary of z. This can happen if x touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Yes, both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible. I can't think of other possibilities, so I believe these are the only two possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, I think I might have been too quick to answer. Let me double check, but using a slightly different approach.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

I'll consider all 8 RCC-8 relations and check which ones are possible for the relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. Since x is a part of y and y is a part of z, x is also a part of z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z are externally connected, touching at their boundaries but not overlapping. Since x is a part of y and y is a part of z, x is also a part of z, which means they overlap. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, with some parts of x not in z and some parts of z not in x. Since x is a part of y and y is a part of z, all of x is inside z. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z. This is possible if x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. This is possible if x touches the boundary of y at a point where y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. Since x is a part of y and y is a part of z, z cannot be a part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Since x is a part of y and y is a part of z, z cannot be a part of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are equal. Since x is a part of y and y is a part of z, and both x and y are proper parts (not equal to the whole), x cannot be equal to z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Let me actually draw some simple diagrams to make sure.

Case 1: TPP(x,z)
Imagine x, y, and z as nested rectangles. The top edge of x, y, and z all align. In this arrangement, x touches the boundary of y, y touches the boundary of z, and x also touches the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is satisfied.

Case 2: NTPP(x,z)
Imagine x, y, and z as nested rectangles. The top edge of x and y align, but this edge is some distance away from the top edge of z. In this arrangement, x touches the boundary of y, y touches the boundary of z, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, NTPP(x,z) is satisfied.

These diagrams confirm that both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Actually wait, I'm realizing I think we can get PO(x, z) as well. Let me re-think this. Given TPP(x, y) and TPP(y, z), can we get PO(x, z)?

Actually, I think I misspoke. PO(x,z) would mean that x and z partially overlap, with some parts of x not in z and some parts of z not in x. But if TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then x is entirely contained within y, and y is entirely contained within z. So, x is entirely contained within z, which means PO(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double check the other cases as well to make sure my reasoning is sound.

First, let me clarify what it means for x to be a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y)):
- x is a proper part of y (all of x is inside y, and x ≠ y).
- x touches the boundary of y.

Similarly, for TPP(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z (all of y is inside z, and y ≠ z).
- y touches the boundary of z.

Given these constraints:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is also inside z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is also inside z, which means they are not just externally connected. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, all of x is inside z, which means they do not just partially overlap. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible if x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, z cannot be a part of x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. Since x is inside y and y is inside z, z cannot be a part of x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. Since x is a proper part of y (meaning x ≠ y) and y is a proper part of z (meaning y ≠ z), x cannot be equal to z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, I think I'm realizing one more thing. Let me double check my definition for TPP. 

It says "TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary."

Similarly, "TPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and touches z's boundary."

From these, we know that:
- x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
- y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

Given that x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, by transitivity, x is a proper part of z. But whether x touches the boundary of z depends on where exactly x and y touch their respective containers. There are two possibilities:

1. If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x also touches the boundary of z. In this case, TPP(x,z).

2. If x touches the boundary of y only at points where y doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x doesn't touch the boundary of z. In this case, NTPP(x,z).

I believe my understanding of the definitions is correct. So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

To confirm even further, let me draw a simple 1D example.

Consider a line segment z = [0, 4], and within it, a line segment y = [1, 3], and within y, a line segment x = [1, 2].

For TPP(x,y):
- x is a proper part of y because x = [1, 2] is contained within y = [1, 3] and x ≠ y.
- x touches the boundary of y at point 1.

For TPP(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z because y = [1, 3] is contained within z = [0, 4] and y ≠ z.
- y touches the boundary of z at points 1 and 3.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:
- x is a proper part of z because x = [1, 2] is contained within z = [0, 4] and x ≠ z.
- x touches the boundary of z at point 1.

So, in this example, TPP(x,z) is satisfied.

Let's modify the example to illustrate NTPP(x,z):
Consider a line segment z = [0, 4], and within it, a line segment y = [1, 3], and within y, a line segment x = [2, 3].

For TPP(x,y):
- x is a proper part of y because x = [2, 3] is contained within y = [1, 3] and x ≠ y.
- x touches the boundary of y at point 3.

For TPP(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z because y = [1, 3] is contained within z = [0, 4] and y ≠ z.
- y touches the boundary of z at points 1 and 3.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:
- x is a proper part of z because x = [2, 3] is contained within z = [0, 4] and x ≠ z.
- x touches the boundary of z at point 3.

So, in this modified example, TPP(x,z) is still satisfied. Let me try another example to get NTPP(x,z).

Consider a line segment z = [0, 4], and within it, a line segment y = [1, 3], and within y, a line segment x = [1.5, 2.5].

For TPP(x,y):
- x is a proper part of y because x = [1.5, 2.5] is contained within y = [1, 3] and x ≠ y.
- x doesn't touch the boundary of y.

Wait, that doesn't work for TPP(x,y) because x doesn't touch the boundary of y. Let me revise.

Consider a line segment z = [0, 4], and within it, a line segment y = [1, 3], and within y, a line segment x = [1, 2].

For TPP(x,y):
- x is a proper part of y because x = [1, 2] is contained within y = [1, 3] and x ≠ y.
- x touches the boundary of y at point 1.

For TPP(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z because y = [1, 3] is contained within z = [0, 4] and y ≠ z.
- y touches the boundary of z at points 1 and 3.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:
- x is a proper part of z because x = [1, 2] is contained within z = [0, 4] and x ≠ z.
- x touches the boundary of z at point 1.

So, in this example, TPP(x,z) is satisfied.

Let's try a 2D example to illustrate NTPP(x,z):

Consider a square z with vertices at (0,0), (0,3), (3,3), and (3,0). Inside z, there's a square y with vertices at (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and (2,1). Inside y, there's a square x with vertices at (1,1), (1,1.5), (1.5,1.5), and (1.5,1).

For TPP(x,y):
- x is a proper part of y because x is contained within y and x ≠ y.
- x touches the boundary of y at the edges from (1,1) to (1,1.5) and from (1,1) to (1.5,1).

For TPP(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z because y is contained within z and y ≠ z.
- y doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Wait, that doesn't work for TPP(y,z) because y doesn't touch the boundary of z. Let me revise.

Consider a square z with vertices at (0,0), (0,3), (3,3), and (3,0). Inside z, there's a square y with vertices at (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0). Inside y, there's a square x with vertices at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,0).

For TPP(x,y):
- x is a proper part of y because x is contained within y and x ≠ y.
- x touches the boundary of y at the edges from (0,0) to (0,1) and from (0,0) to (1,0).

For TPP(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z because y is contained within z and y ≠ z.
- y touches the boundary of z at the edges from (0,0) to (0,2) and from (0,0) to (2,0).

Now, for the relationship between x and z:
- x is a proper part of z because x is contained within z and x ≠ z.
- x touches the boundary of z at the edges from (0,0) to (0,1) and from (0,0) to (1,0).

So, in this example, TPP(x,z) is satisfied.

Now, let's try to construct an example where NTPP(x,z) is satisfied.

Consider a square z with vertices at (0,0), (0,3), (3,3), and (3,0). Inside z, there's a square y with vertices at (1,0), (1,2), (3,2), and (3,0). Inside y, there's a square x with vertices at (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,0).

For TPP(x,y):
- x is a proper part of y because x is contained within y and x ≠ y.
- x touches the boundary of y at the edges from (2,0) to (3,0) and from (3,0) to (3,1).

For TPP(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z because y is contained within z and y ≠ z.
- y touches the boundary of z at the edges from (1,0) to (3,0) and from (3,0) to (3,2).

Now, for the relationship between x and z:
- x is a proper part of z because x is contained within z and x ≠ z.
- x touches the boundary of z at the edges from (2,0) to (3,0) and from (3,0) to (3,1).

So, in this example, TPP(x,z) is still satisfied. Let me try another approach.

Wait, I think I see the issue. Let me draw a diagram on paper and then describe it. It seems my previous examples weren't capturing the NTPP(x,z) scenario correctly.

I think I found a good example: Imagine a square region z. Inside z, there's a smaller square region y positioned such that one corner of y touches one corner of z, but otherwise, y is completely inside z. Now, inside y, there's an even smaller square region x positioned such that one corner of x touches a corner of y, but this corner is not the same corner where y touches z. In this scenario:

For TPP(x,y):
- x is a proper part of y because x is contained within y and x ≠ y.
- x touches the boundary of y at a corner.

For TPP(y,z):
- y is a proper part of z because y is contained within z and y ≠ z.
- y touches the boundary of z at a corner.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:
- x is a proper part of z because x is contained within z and x ≠ z.
- x doesn't touch the boundary of z because the corner of x that touches y's boundary is not the same corner where y touches z's boundary.

So, in this example, NTPP(x,z) is satisfied.

To summarize, both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible relationships between x and z given the constraints TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z). The specific relationship depends on whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

Actually, let me double check again. If x touches the boundary of y at a point, and y touches the boundary of z at a different point, then x is inside z but doesn't touch its boundary, making NTPP(x,z). If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x also touches the boundary of z, making TPP(x,z). Given that both scenarios are plausible, both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are possible.

So the answer is TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze what follows from TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is part of z and touches z's boundary)

Analysis:
Since x is part of y, and y is part of z, it follows that x must be part of z (by transitivity). The question is whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

There are two possible scenarios:

1. If x touches the boundary of y at a point where y touches the boundary of z, then x will also touch the boundary of z. In this case, TPP(x,z) holds.

2. If x touches the boundary of y only at points where y does not touch the boundary of z, then x will be completely in the interior of z without touching z's boundary. In this case, NTPP(x,z) holds.

Both scenarios are geometrically possible while maintaining the given constraints.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
