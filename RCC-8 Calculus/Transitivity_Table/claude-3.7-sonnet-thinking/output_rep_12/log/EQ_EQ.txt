PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. We're given that:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same spatial region.
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident, i.e., they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

So, x and y are coincident, and y and z are coincident. 

When we have EQ(x,y), it means x and y are the same spatial entity, they completely overlap and have the same boundaries. Similarly, EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same spatial entity.

If x and y are the same spatial entity, and y and z are the same spatial entity, then by transitivity, x and z must also be the same spatial entity. In other words, x and z must also be coincident.

So, the relationship between x and z would be EQ(x,z), meaning x and z are coincident.

Let's double check this:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident.
- If x = y and y = z (where "=" represents spatial equivalence), then x = z.
- Therefore, EQ(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z given the conditions is EQ(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z when EQ(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Given:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are coincident

When x and y are coincident, and y and z are coincident, then by transitivity, x and z must also be coincident.

### Answer: EQ(x,z)
