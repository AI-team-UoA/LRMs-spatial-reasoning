PROMPT: If DC(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem systematically by considering the given relationships:

1. DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected (they don't share any spatial parts).
2. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.

Now, given these constraints, I need to determine what the possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z could be.

Let's analyze each of the 8 possible relations to see which ones are consistent with the constraints:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   - This is possible. If x is disconnected from y, and y only touches z at the boundary, then x could still be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at the boundary.
   - This is possible too. Even though x is disconnected from y, it's still possible for x to touch z at the boundary, as long as the point of contact between x and z is not the same as the point of contact between y and z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   - This is possible. x could be disconnected from y but still partially overlap with z in regions that are separate from where y and z touch.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   - This is possible. x could be within z, touching z's boundary, while being completely disconnected from y.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   - This is possible. x could be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, while being disconnected from y.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   - This is possible. z could be within x, touching x's boundary, while y is outside of x and only touches z at the boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   - This is possible. z could be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary, while y is outside of x and only touches z at the boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   - This is probably not possible. If x and z are the same region, and y touches z at the boundary, then y would also touch x at the boundary, which contradicts DC(x,y). However, I need to think more carefully about this.

Actually, let me reconsider these more carefully:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at a boundary, so x and z can be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at a boundary, but x can still touch z at a different boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x can overlap with parts of z away from where y touches z, while still being disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be contained in z, touching z's boundary, while being disconnected from y (if y touches z at a different part of the boundary).

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. x can be completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, and thus be disconnected from y which is outside and only touches z at the boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is this possible? If z is a proper part of x, and y touches z at the boundary, then y must also touch x at the boundary (since z's boundary is part of x's interior or boundary). But this contradicts DC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is this possible? If z is completely inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y touches z at the boundary, then y must be inside x as well. This would mean y touches x, which contradicts DC(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x equals z, and y touches z at the boundary, then y would also touch x at the boundary, which contradicts DC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me reconsider points 6 and 7 again. I think I made an error:

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, it means z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary. Now, if y touches z at z's boundary, it depends on where this touch occurs. If it's at a point where z also touches x's boundary, then y would also touch x's boundary, contradicting DC(x,y). But if y touches z at a boundary part that's in the interior of x, then y would be partially inside x, again contradicting DC(x,y). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is fully contained within x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, then y must be inside x, which would contradict DC(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

OK let me try a different, more precise approach for points 6 and 7:

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x, and touches x's boundary. 

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary. 

Now, for DC(x,y) to hold, x and y must be disconnected, which means they don't touch. 

But if z is inside x and y touches z at a boundary point, then that boundary point of z might be:
- At the boundary of x: In this case, y would touch x at this point, contradicting DC(x,y).
- Inside x: In this case, y would also be inside x to touch z, contradicting DC(x,y).

So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary.

For DC(x,y) to hold, x and y must be disconnected.

But if z is completely inside x and y touches z at a boundary point, then y would have to be at least partially inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y touches z at the boundary (due to EC(y,z)), then y would also touch x at the boundary. This contradicts DC(x,y).

So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I think the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this more carefully once more.

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at a boundary, so x and z can be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at a boundary, but x can still touch z at a different boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x can overlap with parts of z away from where y touches z, while still being disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. 

Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected.

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary.

So, if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, x might touch z's boundary at the same point where y touches it. This would make x and y touch, contradicting DC(x,y).

But x could touch z's boundary at a point different from where y touches it. In this case, TPP(x,z) would be possible while maintaining DC(x,y).

Actually, I should realize that just because x and z touch at a boundary and y and z touch at a boundary, does not necessarily mean that x and y touch each other. They could be touching z at different parts of z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is definitely possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected.

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary.

In this case, x is inside z, away from z's boundary, and y touches z at the boundary. x and y are still disconnected, which is consistent with DC(x,y).

So NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary.

Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected.

If z is inside x and y touches z at the boundary, then y would be touching a part of x (since z is inside x), which contradicts DC(x,y).

So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary.

Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected.

If z is inside x and y touches z at the boundary, then y would be inside x to touch z, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y touches z at the boundary (due to EC(y,z)), then y would also touch x at the boundary. This contradicts DC(x,y).

So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me think through case 6 one more time to make sure I have the reasoning correct.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary.

Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected.

If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, there are two possibilities:
- If y touches z at a point where z touches x's boundary, then y would be touching x at that point, contradicting DC(x,y).
- If y touches z at a point of z's boundary that's not where z touches x's boundary (i.e., a part of z's boundary that's inside x), then y would be inside x to touch z, which also contradicts DC(x,y).

Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

OK, so the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I realized that I'm forgetting that relations like TPP mean that x is a *proper* part of z, so I need to be more careful in my reasoning. Let me try again for each relation, making sure to be precise about the meaning of each relation.

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at a boundary, so x and z can be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and y are disconnected, y and z touch at a boundary, but x can still touch z at a different boundary point.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x can overlap with parts of z away from where y touches z, while still being disconnected from y.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, which means x is inside z (x is a proper subset of z) and x touches z's boundary. 

Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected.

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary.

If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and y touches z at a different part of z's boundary, then x and y can still be disconnected. 

However, I think I need to consider more carefully a specific case: what if y is "between" x and the "outside" of z? If y and z are touching at the boundary (EC), and x is a proper part of z, what if y is positioned such that for x to "leave" z, it would have to "go through" y? In that case, would x and y still be disconnected?

Actually, this concern doesn't make sense because regions are 2D (or higher dimensional), so x can "leave" z in many different directions, not just through y. As long as y doesn't completely surround x, x and y can be disconnected.

So, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected.

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary.

In this case, x is inside z, away from z's boundary, and y touches z at the boundary. x and y are still disconnected, which is consistent with DC(x,y).

So NTPP(x,z) is also possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x (z is a proper subset of x) and z touches x's boundary.

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary.

Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected.

If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, there are a few cases:
- The point where z touches x's boundary: if y touches z at this point, then y would also touch x at this point, contradicting DC(x,y).
- Any other point on z's boundary: these points are inside x. If y touches z at such a point, then y would be inside x, which means y touches x, contradicting DC(x,y).

So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

Given EC(y,z), y touches z at z's boundary.

Given DC(x,y), x and y are disconnected.

If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then all of z's boundary is inside x. If y touches z at z's boundary, then y would be inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, and y touches z at the boundary (due to EC(y,z)), then y would also touch x at the boundary. This contradicts DC(x,y).

So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

I think the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me go through the cases one more time. To be even more thorough, I will use the following definitions:

- DC(a,b): a and b have no points in common.
- EC(a,b): a and b have boundary points in common, but their interiors are disjoint.
- PO(a,b): the interior of a has points in common with the interior of b, but neither is a subset of the other.
- TPP(a,b): a is a proper subset of b, and a has boundary points in common with b.
- NTPP(a,b): a is a proper subset of b, and a has no boundary points in common with b.
- TPPi(a,b): b is a proper subset of a, and b has boundary points in common with a.
- NTPPi(a,b): b is a proper subset of a, and b has no boundary points in common with a.
- EQ(a,b): a and b are the same set of points.

Given:
- DC(x,y): x and y have no points in common.
- EC(y,z): y and z have boundary points in common, but their interiors are disjoint.

Let's check each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. x and y have no points in common, and y and z only share boundary points. It's possible for x and z to also have no points in common. For instance, x could be a region to the left of y, and z could be a region to the right of y.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and y have no points in common, and y and z only share boundary points. It's possible for x and z to share a boundary without involving y. For example, x could touch z at a boundary point or segment away from where y touches z.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. x and z can overlap in a region away from where y is. Since y only touches z at z's boundary (and is disconnected from x), x and z can have a partial overlap without affecting the given conditions.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z, and x has boundary points in common with z. Given that y touches z at z's boundary, and x is disconnected from y, x can still be a tangential proper part of z, as long as the boundary points where x touches z are different from the ones where y touches z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a proper subset of z, and x has no boundary points in common with z. This is possible. If x is deep inside z, and y touches z at the boundary, then x and y can still be disconnected.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x, and z has boundary points in common with x. Given that y touches z at z's boundary, and x is disconnected from y, this relation seems problematic. If z is a proper subset of x and touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then there's a spatial configuration where y could be touching x through z. I need to consider this more carefully.

   Let's say p is a boundary point of z where y touches z. If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z touches x's boundary. Let's say p is also a point where z touches x's boundary. Then y, which touches z at p, would also touch x at p, contradicting DC(x,y).

   But what if p is a boundary point of z that's not on x's boundary (i.e., p is inside x)? Then for y to touch z at p, y would have to intrude inside x, which contradicts DC(x,y).

   So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a proper subset of x, and z has no boundary points in common with x. Given that y touches z at z's boundary, for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, all of z's boundary must be inside x. For y to touch z at z's boundary, y must also be inside x. But this contradicts DC(x,y).

   So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are the same set of points. If x and z are the same, and y touches z at the boundary, then y would also touch x at the boundary, which contradicts DC(x,y).

   So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

But wait, let me just double-check for PO(x, z). The definition says "the interior of a has points in common with the interior of b, but neither is a subset of the other." So x and z have overlapping interiors, but neither is a subset of the other.

Given DC(x,y), x and y have no points in common.
Given EC(y,z), y and z have boundary points in common, but their interiors are disjoint.

If x and z partially overlap, and y touches z at the boundary, could y also touch x through this overlap? No, because the overlap is in the interior of both x and z, while y only touches z at the boundary. So PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

So my final answer is: The possible relations between x and z are DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given that DC(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each of the 8 RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z) - Possible. Since x is disconnected from y, and y only touches z at the boundary, x can be completely disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible. x can touch z at its boundary at a different location than where y touches z, while remaining disconnected from y.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x can partially overlap with z in regions away from where y touches z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be properly contained within z and touch z's boundary at points different from where y touches z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible. x can be properly contained completely within z without touching z's boundary, maintaining disconnection from y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible. If z were a tangential proper part of x, then y touching z at the boundary would mean y must either touch or intrude into x, contradicting DC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible. If z were completely contained within x, then y touching z at the boundary would place y inside x, contradicting DC(x,y).

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x equals z, then y touching z would mean y touches x, contradicting DC(x,y).

### Answer: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
