PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me first review the definitions of the relations:

1. DC(x,y) means that x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
2. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
3. PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x), meaning y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x), meaning y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (the same).

So in this problem, we have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. So y is strictly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. So z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

I need to determine what the possible relationships between x and z could be.

Given:
- y is strictly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y)).
- z is inside y and touches y's boundary (from TPPi(y,z)).

Now, I need to consider what this means for the relationship between x and z.

Since y is strictly inside x and z is inside y, we know that z is inside x. This eliminates several possible relations between x and z: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi. We're left with TPP, NTPP, or EQ.

Since z is inside y, and y is strictly inside x, it's not possible for z to be equal to x. So EQ is not a possibility.

Now I need to determine if z can touch x's boundary.

Since z touches y's boundary and y doesn't touch x's boundary, there's a gap between y's boundary and x's boundary. This means z can't reach x's boundary. Therefore, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by sketching it out. 

Imagine x as a large circle. Since y is strictly inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y is a smaller circle completely inside x with some space between y's boundary and x's boundary. Now, z is inside y and touches y's boundary. So z is an even smaller circle or shape inside y that touches y's boundary at one or more points.

Given this arrangement, z is definitely inside x with a gap between z and x's boundary. This confirms that the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, now that I think more carefully, let me verify that z can't touch x's boundary. We have:
- z touches y's boundary.
- y doesn't touch x's boundary.

So if z is at a point on y's boundary, it's still separated from x's boundary by the gap between y's boundary and x's boundary. This means z can't touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm wait, actually I think I should be more careful about whether the region z could extend outside of y. 

From TPPi(y,z), we know that z is tangentially properly containing y. That means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z. But this doesn't prevent z from extending outside of y. In fact, since y is a proper part of z, z must extend beyond y.

Let me reconsider.

From NTPPi(x,y), we know that y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary.
From TPPi(y,z), we know that z properly contains y, and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, since y is strictly inside x, any region touching y's boundary is also inside x. But this doesn't necessarily mean that z is strictly inside x. It could touch x's boundary or even extend beyond it.

Let's consider all the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - This is not possible because y is a part of both x and z, so x and z share at least the part y.
2. EC(x,z) - This is not possible for the same reason as DC(x,z).
3. PO(x,z) - This is possible if z extends beyond the boundary of x. In this case, z shares a part with x (at least y), but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,z) - This is not possible because TPP(x,z) would imply that x is a part of z, which isn't ensured by the given conditions.
5. NTPP(x,z) - This is not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).
6. TPPi(x,z) - This is possible if z is fully within x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - This is possible if z is fully within x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - This is not possible because y is a proper part of both x and z, which means y ≠ x and y ≠ z, which in turn means x ≠ z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

No wait, I think I'm making an error in my understanding of TPPi.

Let's review:
- TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y). This means z is a tangential proper part of y, not that y is a tangential proper part of z as I incorrectly stated earlier.
- So, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- Since y is strictly inside x, and z is inside y, z is also strictly inside x.

Now, the question is: does z touch x's boundary?

Since z touches y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, there's a gap between y's boundary and x's boundary. This means z, which only touches y's boundary, cannot reach x's boundary. Therefore, z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

No actually wait, let me be even more careful and precise. 

I have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), so y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is fully inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), so z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is fully inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, since z is fully inside y, and y is fully inside x, it follows that z is fully inside x. 

The next question is: does z touch x's boundary? Since z touches y's boundary, and y doesn't touch x's boundary, z is still separated from x's boundary by some distance. Therefore, z doesn't touch x's boundary. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, wait, I'm still not sure I'm reasoning about these relations correctly.

Let's reconsider:

- NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. So, y is strictly inside x.
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y. So, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, since z is inside y, and y is strictly inside x, it follows that z is inside x.

Since y doesn't touch the boundary of x (from NTPP(y,x)), and z is inside y touching y's boundary, z is still inside x with some distance to x's boundary. This means z cannot touch the boundary of x, making z a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually wait, let me reread the question. 

"NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z)"

So I have:
1. NTPPi(x,y) which means y is non-tangentially properly part of x. So y is strictly inside x.
2. TPPi(y,z) which means z is tangentially properly part of y. So z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Wait, I think I had the definition of TPPi mixed up. TPPi(y,z) doesn't mean TPP(z,y). Instead, TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which would be TPP(z,y).

So, TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's reconsider:

- NTPPi(x,y) means y is non-tangentially properly inside x. So y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means y is tangentially properly inside z. So y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Given these, what's the relationship between x and z?

Since y is inside both x and z, x and z must overlap. But the exact relationship could vary.

Let's consider all the possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible because y is part of both x and z.
2. EC(x,z) - Not possible because y is part of both x and z.
3. PO(x,z) - Possible. x and z overlap because they both contain y, but neither might be fully inside the other.
4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. x could be inside z and touch z's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible. x could be inside z without touching z's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible. z could be inside x and touch x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible. z could be inside x without touching x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,z) - Possible. x and z could be the same.

Hmm, that's a lot of possibilities. Let me see if I can narrow it down more.

From NTPPi(x,y), we know y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary.
From TPPi(y,z), we know y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

So, if y touches z's boundary, but doesn't touch x's boundary, then z's boundary extends beyond y in a way that might or might not touch or extend beyond x's boundary.

Let me think about this differently.

Imagine a concrete example: x is a large circle, y is a medium circle inside x (not touching the boundary of x), and z is another circle. From TPPi(y,z), we know y is inside z and touches z's boundary, so z must be larger than y.

The question is: how does z relate to x?

Well, z could be entirely inside x, or it could extend beyond the boundary of x. If z is inside x, it could either touch x's boundary or not. If z extends beyond x's boundary, then x and z overlap, but neither is inside the other.

So, the possible relations between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z).

Actually, EQ(x,z) seems unlikely. If y is a proper part of both x and z, and y touches the boundary of z but not the boundary of x, then x and z have different boundaries. This eliminates EQ(x,z).

Let's reconsider:

NTPPi(x,y) means NTPP(y,x), which means y is a proper part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(y,z), which means y is a proper part of z and touches the boundary of z.

So, y is a proper part of both x and z. y doesn't touch x's boundary, but it does touch z's boundary. This means x and z have different boundaries, so they can't be identical. This eliminates EQ(x,z).

But the other possibilities remain: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let's think more. If y touches z's boundary, then the points where y touches z's boundary are inside x (since y is strictly inside x). This means parts of z's boundary are inside x. This rules out DC(x,z) and EC(x,z), which we already determined.

But the relationship between x and z can still be any of PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

Let me continue to reason...

Actually, I realize I need to be more careful about the exact definitions of TPP and TPPi. The "i" in TPPi indicates the inverse relation.

TPP(a,b) means a is a tangential proper part of b, which means a is inside b and touches b's boundary.
TPPi(a,b) means the inverse, which is TPP(b,a). This means b is a tangential proper part of a, or equivalently, a tangentially properly contains b.

Similarly, NTPP(a,b) means a is a non-tangential proper part of b, which means a is inside b without touching b's boundary.
NTPPi(a,b) means the inverse, which is NTPP(b,a). This means b is a non-tangential proper part of a, or equivalently, a non-tangentially properly contains b.

So, let me re-interpret the given conditions:

NTPPi(x,y) means x non-tangentially properly contains y. This means y is inside x without touching x's boundary.

TPPi(y,z) means y tangentially properly contains z. This means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Now, given these, what is the relationship between x and z?

Since z is inside y (from TPPi(y,z)), and y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), it follows that z is inside x. So, z is a proper part of x.

Now, does z touch the boundary of x? Well, z touches the boundary of y (from TPPi(y,z)), and y doesn't touch the boundary of x (from NTPPi(x,y)). So, z doesn't touch the boundary of x. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I need to be careful. TPPi(y,z) means y tangentially properly contains z, which means z is inside y and touches y's boundary. Let's be clear on this.

TPPi(y,z) means the inverse of TPP(y,z).
TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
So, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given this, let's reconsider:

NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x, so y is inside x without touching x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, so z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, it follows that z is inside x. So, z is a proper part of x.

Now, does z touch the boundary of x? Well, z touches the boundary of y, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x. There's a gap between y's boundary and x's boundary. So, even though z touches y's boundary, it can't reach x's boundary due to this gap. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider from the start to be absolutely certain:

RCC8 relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but their interiors don't overlap.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is inside y without touching y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are identical.

Given:
NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. So, y is inside x without touching x's boundary.
TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y. So, z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

Since z is inside y, and y is inside x, it follows that z is inside x. So, z is a proper part of x.

Now, the question is whether z touches the boundary of x.

z touches the boundary of y, but y doesn't touch the boundary of x. Since there's a gap between y's boundary and x's boundary, z, which only touches y's boundary, can't touch x's boundary. This means z is inside x without touching x's boundary, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let's make sure that TPPi(y,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of y. 

TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z. So, y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
TPPi(y,z) means the inverse, which is TPP(z,y). This means z is a tangential proper part of y, which means z is inside y and touches y's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) indeed means z is a tangential proper part of y.

I just realized I am being way more wordy than needed. Let me simplify all the above.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. So, y is contained within x, not touching x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of y. So, z is contained within y, touching y's boundary.

From these, we can deduce:
- Since z is inside y (from TPPi(y,z)), and y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y)), z must be inside x.
- Does z touch the boundary of x? z touches the boundary of y, but y is separated from the boundary of x. This means z cannot reach the boundary of x. So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, now let me reread the definitions to make absolutely sure I understand them.

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no parts.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
3. PO(x,y): x and y share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y but doesn't touch y's boundary.
6. TPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which is TPP(y,x). So, y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
7. NTPPi(x,y): This is the inverse of NTPP(x,y), which is NTPP(y,x). So, y is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are the same.

So, we have:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a proper part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

From these, it follows that z is inside y, which is inside x. So, z is inside x. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and z is inside y, z also doesn't touch x's boundary. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or NTPP(z,x), which is the same as NTPPi(x,z).

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, I should be a little bit more careful here. Let me draw this out. 

Let's denote: 
- **A** to be the region of space occupied by x
- **B** to be the region of space occupied by y
- **C** to be the region of space occupied by z

NTPPi(x,y) means B is properly (non-tangentially) within A. We can visualize B as being a circle that's fully within circle A, with some distance between the boundaries of A and B. 

TPPi(y,z) means C is properly (tangentially) within B. We can visualize C as being a circle that's fully within circle B, with some points touching the boundary of B.

Given this setup, it's clear that C is properly (non-tangentially) within A, i.e., C is a circle fully within the larger circle A, with some distance between the boundaries of A and C.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Let me double check this with another example. Imagine:
- x is a big square
- y is a circle inside the square, not touching the square's edges
- z is a smaller circle inside y, touching y's boundary at one or more points

Since z touches y's boundary, but y doesn't touch x's boundary, z doesn't touch x's boundary. So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, giving us NTPPi(x,z).

Alright, I'm convinced. The relation between x and z is NTPPi(x,z), which is equivalent to NTPP(z,x).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the relationship between x and z, given that NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these relations mean:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and touches y's boundary.

Given these conditions, I can determine:
1. Since z is inside y (from TPPi(y,z))
2. And y is inside x (from NTPPi(x,y))
3. Therefore z is inside x

Additionally, I need to determine if z touches x's boundary:
- z touches y's boundary (from TPPi(y,z))
- y doesn't touch x's boundary (from NTPPi(x,y))
- Therefore, there's a gap between y's boundary and x's boundary
- This means z cannot reach x's boundary even though it touches y's boundary

Since z is completely inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
