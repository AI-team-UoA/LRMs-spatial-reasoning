PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected, meaning they share no spatial parts.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are spatially identical. This means that any spatial relationship that y has with another region z, x must also have the same relationship with z.

Since DC(y,z), y and z are disconnected, meaning they share no spatial parts.

Given that x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), and y is disconnected from z (DC(y,z)), the only possible relationship between x and z is also disconnected.

Therefore, the possible relationship between x and z is:
- DC(x,z)

Let me double-check this reasoning by considering the definition of each of the RCC-8 relations:

- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
- TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y occupy exactly the same space. Since DC(y,z), y and z share no spatial parts. Therefore, x and z must also share no spatial parts, which means DC(x,z).

So the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this by applying the composition table for RCC-8 relations. The composition of EQ(x,y) and DC(y,z) would be written as EQ ◦ DC. 

For RCC-8, EQ ◦ DC = DC. This means that if x equals y and y is disconnected from z, then x is disconnected from z.

So, my final answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine what happens when we combine EQ(x,y) with DC(y,z).

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected (they share no spatial parts)

Since x and y are exactly the same spatial region (EQ), and y is disconnected from z (DC), then x must also be disconnected from z.

When two regions are identical, they must have the same spatial relationships with any third region. Therefore, x must have the same relationship with z that y has with z.

### Answer: DC(x,z)
