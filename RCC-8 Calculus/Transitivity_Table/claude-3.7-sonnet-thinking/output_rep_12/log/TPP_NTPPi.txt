PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We're given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

To summarize what we know:
- x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary

Now, I need to determine what relationship(s) could hold between x and z.

Let's consider each of the 8 possible relations from RCC-8:

1. DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? 
   We know that both x and z are parts of y, but they could be separate parts within y. Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and x does, they could be disconnected regions within y. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected (they touch but don't overlap). 
   Similar to the reasoning above, x and z could be separate parts within y that just touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap.
   This is certainly possible. They could share some parts while each having parts that the other doesn't. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Is this possible? x touches the boundary of y, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary). If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would touch the boundary of z, but that boundary would not be the same as the boundary of y (since z doesn't touch y's boundary). This seems possible. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

   Wait, let me think about this more carefully. TPP(x,z) means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. But z is wholly inside y (not touching y's boundary), while x touches y's boundary. If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would have to touch z's boundary, which is inside y's boundary. But x also touches y's boundary, which means x would have to stretch from z's boundary to y's boundary. But then x wouldn't be a proper part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This doesn't seem possible because x touches the boundary of y, whereas z is strictly inside y. If x were inside z, and z is inside y, then x would also be strictly inside y, which contradicts TPP(x,y). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Given that z doesn't touch the boundary of y, but x does, it seems plausible that z could be a tangential proper part of x. That is, z could be inside x and touch the boundary of x at a point that's not on the boundary of y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Again, given that z doesn't touch the boundary of y, but x does, it seems plausible that z could be a non-tangential proper part of x. That is, z could be wholly inside x without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal.
   This doesn't seem possible because x touches the boundary of y, whereas z doesn't. So they can't be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I need to reconsider some of my reasoning.

Let's recall what TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) mean:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is a proper part of y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): This is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is a proper part of y, and z does not touch the boundary of y.

Let's reconsider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
   We know that both x and z are parts of y. x touches the boundary of y, and z is strictly inside y. It's certainly possible for them to be disconnected regions within y. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
   Similarly, x and z could be separate parts within y that just touch at their boundaries. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
   This is certainly possible. They could share some parts while each having parts that the other doesn't. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
   If x were a tangential proper part of z, then x would touch the boundary of z. But x also touches the boundary of y, which z doesn't. This means the boundary of z would have to include a part that's not on the boundary of y (inside y), and a part that is on the boundary of y. And x would have to touch both. This scenario seems possible. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

   Hmm, actually I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct. Let me think about this differently. If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. Since z is fully inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, how can x touch y's boundary? It can't, because x can't extend beyond z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since z is fully inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, how can x touch y's boundary? It can't, because x can't extend beyond z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Given that z doesn't touch the boundary of y, but x does, it seems plausible that z could be a tangential proper part of x. That is, z could be inside x and touch the boundary of x at a point that's not on the boundary of y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similarly, z could be wholly inside x without touching x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal.
   This doesn't seem possible because x touches the boundary of y, whereas z doesn't. So they can't be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

OK, so I think the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think about the TPP case more carefully. 

We know:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) or equivalently NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

If TPP(x,z), then x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, if x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)) and x is a proper part of z (from TPP(x,z)), then z must also touch y's boundary at the point where x touches it. But this contradicts NTPP(z,y), which says z doesn't touch y's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me now reconsider the NTPP case with similar reasoning.

If NTPP(x,z), then x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

But we know x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)). If x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, how can x touch y's boundary? It can't.

So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Now, let's reconsider the TPPi case.

If TPPi(x,z) or equivalently TPP(z,x), then z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

We know z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(z,y)). If z touches x's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then z must touch a part of x's boundary that's not on y's boundary. This seems entirely possible.

So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Finally, let's reconsider the NTPPi case.

If NTPPi(x,z) or equivalently NTPP(z,x), then z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.

Again, z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(z,y)), and in this case, z doesn't touch x's boundary either. This is certainly possible.

So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, actually, let me think about the TPP case one more time. 

Could TPP(x,z) be possible? We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now, I'm trying to determine if TPP(x,z) is possible. TPP(x,z) would mean x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

I previously said this wasn't possible because if x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)) and x is a proper part of z (from TPP(x,z)), then z must also touch y's boundary at the point where x touches it. But this contradicts NTPP(z,y), which says z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Hmm, I'm double-checking this. TPP(x,z) implies that x touches the boundary of z, not necessarily the boundary of y. But since x also touches the boundary of y, and x is fully inside z, z would have to extend to the boundary of y for x to touch both the boundary of z and the boundary of y. But this contradicts NTPP(z,y), which says z doesn't touch y's boundary.

So TPP(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, NTPP(x,z) is not possible because if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and z is entirely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then x can't touch y's boundary.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to make sure I'm reasoning correctly about the cases where parts overlap.

Let's reconsider DC(x,z). If x and z are disconnected, then they have no spatial parts in common. They are both parts of y, so this is certainly possible. So DC(x,z) is possible.

Let's reconsider EC(x,z). If x and z are externally connected, then they touch at their boundaries but have no interior parts in common. Again, they are both parts of y, so this is certainly possible. So EC(x,z) is possible.

Let's reconsider PO(x,z). If x and z partially overlap, then they share some spatial part, but neither is part of the other. They are both parts of y, so this is certainly possible. So PO(x,z) is possible.

Let's reconsider TPPi(x,z) or equivalently TPP(z,x). This means z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.

We know z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(z,y)). If z touches x's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then z must touch a part of x's boundary that's not on y's boundary. This seems entirely possible.

Actually, hm. The relation TPP(z, x) would mean that z touches the boundary of x, and is a proper part of x. We know that NTPP(z, y), which means z doesn't touch the boundary of y. If x only overlaps with part of y, it's possible that z touches the boundary of x at a part that doesn't touch the boundary of y. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let's reconsider NTPPi(x,z) or equivalently NTPP(z,x). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning z is a proper part of x and does not touch x's boundary.

Since z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(z,y)), and in this case, z doesn't touch x's boundary either, this is certainly possible.

So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm still not completely satisfied with my reasoning. Let me try to think about this in a different way.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Let's think about this in terms of regions and boundaries. 

x is a region that's fully inside y and touches y's boundary at at least one point.
z is a region that's fully inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary anywhere.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This means they have no points in common. Since both x and z are inside y, and x touches y's boundary while z doesn't, it's entirely possible for them to be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This means they touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. Again, given the constraints, this is entirely possible. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This means they share some points, but each has points that the other doesn't. Again, this is certainly possible. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. But since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, if x were inside z, x couldn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But again, since x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, x can't be inside z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that z doesn't touch y's boundary, if z touches x's boundary, it must be at a point that's not on y's boundary. This is entirely possible. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is fully inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is entirely possible. So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are equal. But we know x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

I think my reasoning is correct now, but let's just double-check the TPP and NTPP cases one more time.

For TPP(x,z), I'm saying this isn't possible because x touches y's boundary, but z doesn't, so x can't be inside z. This is correct.

For NTPP(x,z), I'm saying this isn't possible for the same reason: x touches y's boundary, but z doesn't, so x can't be inside z. This is correct.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the constraints:

- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is inside y and touches y's boundary
- NTPPi(y,z): Equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

Given these constraints, I'll check each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z can be disconnected regions within y. This is possible since x touches y's boundary while z is completely inside y.

2. EC(x,z): x and z can touch at their boundaries without overlapping. This is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z can partially overlap. This is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible because x touches y's boundary, but z doesn't. If x were inside z, x couldn't touch y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): z can be a tangential proper part of x, touching x's boundary at points that aren't on y's boundary. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible because x touches y's boundary while z doesn't.
