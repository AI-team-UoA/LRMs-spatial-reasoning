PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this problem step by step.

First, let's recall the definitions of the RCC-8 spatial relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
- TPPi(x,y): same as TPP(y,x), so y is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(x,y): same as NTPP(y,x), so y is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they are the same region).

Now, I'm given that:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they are the same region).

The question asks for the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same region, any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

So if EC(x,y) and y is the same as z, then EC(x,z) must also be true.

Let's verify this by considering what each relation means:
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
- EQ(y,z) means y and z are the same region.

Therefore, since y and z are the same region, and x touches y at a boundary without sharing interior parts, it must also be the case that x touches z at a boundary without sharing interior parts, which is EC(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this. 

If EQ(y,z), then y and z are the same region. This means that they have the same boundaries and the same interior. 

If EC(x,y), then x touches y only at the boundary, and they don't share any interior parts.

Since z has the same boundary as y (due to EQ(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary, x must also touch z's boundary. And since z has the same interior as y, and x doesn't share any interior parts with y, x also doesn't share any interior parts with z.

So EC(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

To be rigorous, let me check if any other relation from the RCC-8 calculus could hold between x and z:

- DC(x,z)? No, because x touches the boundary of y, and y is the same as z, so x touches the boundary of z, which contradicts DC.
- PO(x,z)? No, because EC(x,y) implies that x and y don't share any interior parts, and since y is the same as z, x and z don't share any interior parts either, which contradicts PO.
- TPP(x,z)? No, because EC(x,y) implies that x is not a part of y, and since y is the same as z, x is not a part of z either, which contradicts TPP.
- NTPP(x,z)? No, for the same reason as TPP.
- TPPi(x,z)? No, because EC(x,y) implies that y is not a part of x, and since y is the same as z, z is not a part of x either, which contradicts TPPi.
- NTPPi(x,z)? No, for the same reason as TPPi.
- EQ(x,z)? No, because EC(x,y) implies that x and y are different regions, and since y is the same as z, x and z are different regions as well, which contradicts EQ.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Actually, let me re-check the logic again to be sure. 

We know:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts.
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are the same region.

For each of the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

- DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since EC(x,y) and y is the same as z, x touches z at a boundary, which contradicts DC.

- EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. This is consistent with EC(x,y) and y being the same as z.

- PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share some interior parts. But since EC(x,y) means x and y don't share interior parts, and y is the same as z, x and z don't share interior parts either, which contradicts PO.

- TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. But since EC(x,y) means x touches y only at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with y, x cannot be a part of y, and thus not a part of z either, which contradicts TPP.

- NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But for the same reasons as TPP, x cannot be a part of z, which contradicts NTPP.

- TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. But since EC(x,y) means y touches x only at the boundary and doesn't share interior parts with x, y cannot be a part of x, and thus z (which is the same as y) cannot be a part of x either, which contradicts TPPi.

- NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But for the same reasons as TPPi, z cannot be a part of x, which contradicts NTPPi.

- EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since EC(x,y) means x and y are different regions that touch only at a boundary, and y is the same as z, x and z must also be different regions, which contradicts EQ.

So, indeed, EC(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

Therefore, the answer is that if EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EC(x,z).

Actually, I realized a more formal way to solve this problem. The RCC-8 calculus has composition tables which tell us which relations are possible between x and z given relations between x and y and y and z.

For the composition of EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), let's use the transitive property of the EQ relation. Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same region, any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Therefore, since EC(x,y), we must have EC(x,z).

Alternatively, we could use the formal composition tables of the RCC-8 calculus, which would tell us that the composition of EC and EQ is EC, confirming our reasoning.

So, the answer is:

If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EC(x,z).

Actually, let me be a bit more careful. I need to make sure that I am considering the RCC-8 calculus correctly.

Let me double-check the composition of EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) in the RCC-8 calculus.

When we compose spatial relations, we're asking: if we know the relation between x and y, and between y and z, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

For the composition of EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are exactly the same region, any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

So, since EC(x,y), we know that EC(x,z) must hold.

To verify this using the composition table of the RCC-8 calculus, I would check the entry for the composition of EC with EQ. The result should be EC, which confirms my reasoning.

Therefore, the answer is:

If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EC(x,z).

Actually, let's do a final re-check by thinking about this problem from the perspective of the properties of the RCC-8 relations.

The EQ relation is an equivalence relation, meaning that if EQ(y,z), then y and z are essentially the same region. Any spatial property or relation that holds for y must also hold for z.

Given that EC(x,y), which means that x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts, and EQ(y,z), which means y and z are the same region, it follows that x and z must touch at a boundary but not share interior parts, i.e., EC(x,z).

So, the answer is:

If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EC(x,z).

This is consistent with the composition table of the RCC-8 calculus, where the composition of EC with EQ yields EC.

Let me summarize: 
If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EC(x,z).

Actually, I just realized I may have overlooked a detail. Let me be extra careful.

The composition of relations in the RCC-8 calculus doesn't always lead to a single relation; sometimes it leads to a disjunction of relations.

In the case of EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), however, the composition is straightforward. 

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are the same region in every aspect. So any relation that x has with y, it will also have with z. 

So, if EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then the only possible relation between x and z is EC(x,z).

Let me recall the definitions to ensure clarity:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they are the same region).

Given these definitions:
1. If EQ(y,z), then any property of y is also a property of z, and vice versa. This includes spatial relations with other objects.
2. If EC(x,y), then x touches y at a boundary but doesn't share any interior parts with y.
3. Since y and z are the same region, x touches z at a boundary but doesn't share any interior parts with z.
4. Therefore, EC(x,z).

So, if EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EC(x,z).

### Answer: EC(x,z)

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relations are possible between x and z given that EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

Let me reason through this:
- EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts
- EQ(y,z) means that y and z are completely coincident (they are the same region)

Since y and z are the exact same region (EQ(y,z)), any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. The equivalence relation EQ effectively means we can substitute z for y in any relation.

Therefore, if EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z), then EC(x,z) must be the only possible relationship between x and z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
