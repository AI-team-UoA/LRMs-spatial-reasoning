PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's start by understanding the relations:

- NTPP(x,y) means "x is a non-tangential proper part of y." This means x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means "y is a tangential proper part of z." This means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given these constraints.

Since NTPP(x,y), x is completely inside y.
Since TPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

So, x is inside y, and y is inside z, which means x is definitely inside z. But I need to determine whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

Since NTPP(x,y), x doesn't touch y's boundary.
Since TPP(y,z), y touches z's boundary.

So, is it possible for x to touch z's boundary? 

If x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)), then x can't touch z's boundary through y. 

This means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, which corresponds to the relation NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. It's possible that x touches z's boundary at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary. But that would contradict NTPP(x,y), because it would mean x extends beyond y in some way.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this: 
- x is strictly inside y (from NTPP(x,y))
- y is inside z and touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z))

Since x is strictly inside y, and y doesn't extend outside z, x must be strictly inside z. And since x doesn't touch y's boundary, it can't touch z's boundary through y. Therefore, x is a non-tangential proper part of z, or NTPP(x,z).

Hmm, let's think about this one more time. There might be a configuration where x touches z's boundary at a point where y also touches z's boundary. 

If NTPP(x,y), then x is strictly inside y, not touching y's boundary.
If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Could x touch z's boundary? For that to happen, x would need to extend to y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary. But NTPP(x,y) specifically states that x does not touch y's boundary. So, x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me check once more using a concrete example. Imagine:

- y is a circle
- x is a smaller circle completely inside y, not touching y's boundary (NTPP(x,y))
- z is a larger circle, and y touches the boundary of z at a single point (TPP(y,z))

In this scenario, x is definitely inside z, and x doesn't touch z's boundary because it doesn't even touch y's boundary, and y only touches z's boundary at a single point.

So, the relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, there's a nuance here. For z to be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), y needs to be inside z and touch z's boundary. 

So I've been thinking about regions as circles, but they don't have to be. 

Let me think more abstractly. 

Let's use the definitions:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y (completely inside) and does not touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z (completely inside) and touches z's boundary.

From NTPP(x,y), we know that x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
From TPP(y,z), we know that y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
1. Is x a part of z? Yes, because x is inside y, and y is inside z, so x is inside z.
2. Does x touch the boundary of z? This is the key question.

Since x doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPP(x,y)), and y touches z's boundary (from TPP(y,z)), x can't touch z's boundary through y. But could x touch z's boundary directly? No, because that would imply x extends beyond y, which contradicts NTPP(x,y).

Therefore, x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, which corresponds to the relation NTPP(x,z).

Ah, I realize I was overthinking this. Given the transitivity of the "part of" relation, and the specific definitions of NTPP and TPP, the relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z).

Let me think about this one more time to be absolutely certain.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

From these, we can conclude:
- x is completely inside y, which is completely inside z. So, x is completely inside z.
- x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary. This means x is separated from z's boundary by at least the distance from x to y's boundary. So, x doesn't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, which corresponds to the relation NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I realize I need to more carefully consider the topological arrangements.

Let's break down the situation:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's think about the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x must be inside z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts. But since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x shares interior parts with z. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap, with parts of each outside the other. But since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is completely inside z. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But for x to touch z's boundary, it would need to touch y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, and NTPP(x,y) explicitly states that x doesn't touch y's boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given the constraints, this is the only possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z): These would mean z is inside x, which contradicts the fact that x is inside y, and y is inside z. So, TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

7. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are coincident, which contradicts the fact that x is inside y, and y is inside z. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me re-examine the possibility of TPP(x,z) to be absolutely certain.

For TPP(x,z), x would need to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. 

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

For x to touch z's boundary, there must be a point on z's boundary that is also a point of x. But all points of x are inside y and separated from y's boundary. And only certain points on y's boundary touch z's boundary.

Can a point inside y, not on y's boundary, be on z's boundary? This would require y to extend beyond z, which contradicts TPP(y,z). Therefore, x cannot touch z's boundary.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Alright, given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary.

The relation between x and z must be NTPP(x,z), which means x is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how region x relates to region z based on the given relations.

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is completely inside y without touching y's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary

Let's analyze what this means for x and z:

1. Since x is completely inside y (from NTPP(x,y)), and y is completely inside z (from TPP(y,z)), we know that x must be completely inside z.

2. Can x touch z's boundary? For this to happen, x would need to touch y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary. However, NTPP(x,y) explicitly states that x does not touch y's boundary at all.

3. Since x cannot touch z's boundary (as established in point 2), and x is completely inside z (as established in point 1), the only possible relation between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
