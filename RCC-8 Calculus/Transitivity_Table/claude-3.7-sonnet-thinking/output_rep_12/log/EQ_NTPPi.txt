PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this step-by-step.

We're given:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (exactly the same region)
- NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z (z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary)

Let's first clarify what NTPPi(y,z) means precisely. Since NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y), it means:
- z is a proper part of y
- z does not touch y's boundary (it's strictly in the interior)

Now, if EQ(x,y), then x and y are identical spatial regions. This means that anything true about y's spatial relationship with other regions is also true about x's relationship with those regions.

Since NTPPi(y,z) means that z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary, and x is identical to y (EQ(x,y)), then z must also be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be:
NTPPi(x,z)

This is because:
- If x and y are identical (EQ(x,y))
- And z is properly contained in y without touching y's boundary (NTPPi(y,z) or equivalently NTPP(z,y))
- Then z must also be properly contained in x without touching x's boundary (NTPPi(x,z) or equivalently NTPP(z,x))

So the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning by considering the definitions again.

EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same region (EQ(x,y)), and z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch y's boundary (NTPP(z,y)), it follows that z is also a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPP(z,x)).

So the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Yes, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the relationship between x and z given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (exactly the same spatial region)
- NTPPi(y,z): z is properly contained within y without touching y's boundary

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are identical regions, any spatial relationship that y has with other regions must also hold for x.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is properly contained within y without touching y's boundary. Since x is identical to y, z must also be properly contained within x without touching x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
