PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the given information:
1. NTPP(x,y) - This means that x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z) - This means that y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Given these two relations, I need to determine what possible RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z.

First, let's understand what NTPP(x,y) tells us more precisely:
- x is completely contained inside y.
- x does not touch the boundary of y.

Similarly, NTPP(y,z) tells us:
- y is completely contained inside z.
- y does not touch the boundary of z.

Since x is completely contained within y, and y is completely contained within z, it follows that x is completely contained within z. This is a transitive relation.

Additionally, since x does not touch the boundary of y, and y does not touch the boundary of z, x cannot touch the boundary of z. 

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z). In other words, x is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Actually, I should double-check this reasoning to make sure I'm not overlooking anything.

If x is inside y without touching y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then x must be inside z. And since x doesn't touch y's boundary, and y doesn't touch z's boundary, there's no way for x to touch z's boundary.

So, the answer remains: NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

Given:
- NTPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze what these conditions mean spatially:

Since x is completely contained within y (without touching y's boundary), and y is completely contained within z (without touching z's boundary), it follows that x must be completely contained within z.

Furthermore, x cannot touch the boundary of z because:
- x doesn't touch y's boundary
- y doesn't touch z's boundary
- Therefore x is separated from z's boundary by at least the distance between y and z's boundary

This means x must be a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
