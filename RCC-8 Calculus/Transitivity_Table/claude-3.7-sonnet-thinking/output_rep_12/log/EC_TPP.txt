PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's understand what we're given.

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
2. TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, we need to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z. Let me go through each of the possible RCC-8 relations and determine if they're compatible with the given constraints.

DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- We know that EC(x,y), which means x and y touch at a boundary.
- We also know that TPP(y,z), which means y is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- If x touches y at a boundary, and y is inside z but touches z's boundary, it's possible that x is completely outside of z. For example, if y is a region that touches the inside of z's boundary at some point, and x is a region outside of z that touches y at the same point on z's boundary, then x and z would be disconnected, i.e., DC(x,z).
- But if y touches z's boundary at a different point than where x touches y, then x would be disconnected from z, i.e., DC(x,z).
- So, DC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- If x touches y at a boundary and y touches z's boundary, then it's possible for x to also touch z's boundary at the same point. This would mean EC(x,z).
- So, EC(x,z) is a possible relationship.

PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- If x touches y at a boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary, it's also possible for x to partially overlap with z.
- For example, if x extends both outside of z and inside z, and the part of x that's inside z overlaps with y, then x and z would partially overlap, i.e., PO(x,z).
- So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- If x touches y at a boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary, it's possible for x to be completely inside z and touch z's boundary.
- For example, if x is a region inside z that touches z's boundary, and y is another region inside z that also touches z's boundary, and x touches y at some point on their boundaries, then TPP(x,z) would hold.
- So, TPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.
- If x touches y at a boundary, and y is inside z and touches z's boundary, it's possible for x to be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.
- For example, if y is a "buffer" region that separates x from z's boundary, and x touches y at a boundary that's inside z, then NTPP(x,z) would hold.
- So, NTPP(x,z) is a possible relationship.

TPPi(x,z): z is part of x and touches x's boundary.
- We know that y is part of z (TPP(y,z)).
- We also know that x and y only touch at a boundary (EC(x,y)).
- If z were part of x, then y would also be part of x (since y is part of z).
- But this would contradict EC(x,y), because if y is part of x, they can't be externally connected.
- So, TPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

NTPPi(x,z): z is part of x but does not touch x's boundary.
- Similar to the reasoning for TPPi(x,z), this would also contradict EC(x,y).
- So, NTPPi(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
- If x and z were the same region, and TPP(y,z), then y would be a proper part of x.
- This would mean that y is inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y).
- So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Hmm, let me just double check NTPP(x,z) by drawing out a scenario. We have EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z). EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but don't overlap. TPP(y,z) means y is part of z and touches z's boundary. 

So y is inside z, and touches the boundary of z at some point. x touches y at some point on y's boundary. 

Wait, if y is inside z and touches z's boundary at point p, and x touches y at y's boundary at point q, can q be strictly inside z, so that x is strictly inside z as well? Let's see...

If p and q are the same point, then x would also touch z at point p, which would be an EC relation between x and z. But if p and q are different points, and q is a point on y's boundary that's strictly inside z (not on z's boundary), then it's possible for x to be strictly inside z as well. In this case, x might even be Non-Tangential Proper Part (NTPP) of z.

However, I'm starting to second guess myself. Let me revisit the possibilities:

DC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y at a point that's on z's boundary, but x is otherwise outside of z.

EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y at a point that's on z's boundary, and x is otherwise outside of z but touches z at that boundary point.

PO(x,z): This is possible if x partially extends inside z and partially outside z, and the part of x inside z touches y at some point.

TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y at some point on y's boundary.

NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z, does not touch z's boundary, and touches y at some point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary.

Hmm, let me reconsider these possibilities.

Actually, I need to be more careful about the consequences of EC(x,y). If x and y are externally connected, they share a point on their boundaries. Let's call this point q. TPP(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, so y is inside z and touches z's boundary at some point, let's call it p. Now, is it possible for q and p to be the same point? If q and p are the same point, then x, y, and z all touch at this common point on z's boundary. In this case, x would also touch z's boundary, so EC(x,z) would hold.

But what if q and p are different points? Then q is a point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary. This means q is strictly inside z. If x touches y only at point q, then x also has a part that's strictly inside z. Depending on the extent of x, it could be:

1. Partially inside and partially outside z (PO(x,z)).
2. Entirely inside z, touching z's boundary at some other point (TPP(x,z)).
3. Entirely inside z, not touching z's boundary (NTPP(x,z)).
4. Entirely outside z except for the single point q (which I think would be classified as EC(x,z) as well).

So I'm confirming that DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z) are all possible.

Let me double-check the case of DC(x,z). If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), can x and z be disconnected? Let's think...

If y is a tangential proper part of z, it means y is inside z and touches z's boundary. If x is externally connected to y, it means x and y touch at a boundary point. Let's call this point q. If q is a point on z's boundary, then x would also touch z at this point, which would make EC(x,z) true, not DC(x,z).

But what if q is a point on y's boundary that's strictly inside z? Then x would also have a part that's strictly inside z (at least the point q). This would mean x and z have a common point, so they can't be disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider the possibilities:

EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y at a point that's on z's boundary.
PO(x,z): This is possible if x partially extends inside z and partially outside z, and the part of x inside z touches y at some point.
TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y at some point on y's boundary.
NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z, does not touch z's boundary, and touches y at some point on y's boundary that's not on z's boundary.

I'm still unsure about DC(x,z). Let me try once more to reason through whether it's possible.

If EC(x,y), then x and y share a point on their boundaries. This point must be somewhere. If it's on z's boundary, then x would also touch z, making EC(x,z) true.
If the point is strictly inside z, then x would also have a point inside z, which means x and z are not disconnected.

So, it seems like DC(x,z) is not possible when EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z). The possible relationships between x and z are:

- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Actually, let me try to think about concrete examples to ensure my reasoning is correct.

Imagine z as a big circle, and y as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary. Now, x is a circle that touches y's boundary. 

If x touches y at the point where y touches z, then x also touches z, making EC(x,z) true.
If x touches y at a point inside z, but x also extends outside z, then PO(x,z) is true.
If x is entirely inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y, then TPP(x,z) is true.
If x is entirely inside z, doesn't touch z's boundary, and touches y, then NTPP(x,z) is true.

Can x be completely outside z? If it were, it would be disconnected from z. But then, how could it touch y, which is inside z? It would need to reach "through" z to touch y, which would mean it shares a part with z, contradicting being outside. So, DC(x,z) doesn't seem possible.

Given the constraints, I am confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:

- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Actually, wait. Let me once more double check DC. What if y is a ring-shaped region inside z that touches z's boundary, and x is a region inside the "hole" of y? Then x would touch y (EC(x,y)), y would be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x would be disconnected from z (DC(x,z)).

Hmm, but in this case, if x is inside the "hole" of y, and y surrounds x, then y contains x, which would make TPP(x,y) or NTPP(x,y) true, not EC(x,y).

Let me try another scenario. What if y is a tangential proper part of z, and x is a region that only touches y at a point that's on the boundary of y and z? Then x might be disconnected from z except for that single point. But if they share that point, they're not disconnected; they're externally connected (EC).

I'm convinced that DC(x,z) is not possible given the constraints. The possible relationships are:

- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Actually, I realize I've been thinking sloppily. I need to clarify what it means for two regions to be "externally connected" (EC). Based on the description, EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. This means they share a point or a segment on their boundaries, but they don't overlap. It's a requirement in RCC-8 that the relationship is between regions, not arbitrary sets, so we're considering regions that are regular closed (they are equal to the closure of their interior). 

So, is it possible for DC(x,z) to be true given the constraints?

If EC(x,y), it means x and y share a boundary point or segment. 
If TPP(y,z), it means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's carefully analyze what happens based on where x touches y:

1. If x touches y at a point that's on z's boundary, then x would also touch z at that point, making EC(x,z) true.
2. If x touches y at a point that's inside z (not on z's boundary), then x would also have a point inside z. This means x and z have a common point, so they can't be disconnected. 

Given these considerations, DC(x,z) is not possible when EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z). The possible relationships between x and z are:

- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

Actually, hold on. I'm thinking about a very specific example. Imagine z as a disk, and y as a "C" shaped region inside z, where the open side of the "C" touches the boundary of z. Now, imagine x as a small disk that's outside of z, but touches the "C" at the point where the "C" touches z's boundary.

In this case, EC(x,y) would be true, TPP(y,z) would be true, and DC(x,z) would also be true.

Hmm, but this doesn't seem right. If x touches y at the point where y touches z, then x would also touch z at that point, making EC(x,z) true, not DC(x,z).

Let me reconsider with more clarity. If EC(x,y), then x and y share a boundary point or segment. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary. The key is where x touches y:

1. If x touches y at a point that's on z's boundary, then x would also touch z at that point, making EC(x,z) true.
2. If x touches y at a point that's inside z (not on z's boundary), then x would also have a point inside z. 

In case 2, x could have other parts outside of z, making PO(x,z) true. Or x could be entirely inside z, making TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z) true.

Could x be entirely outside of z except for the point where it touches y? If that point is on z's boundary, then x would also touch z, making EC(x,z) true, not DC(x,z).

So, DC(x,z) still doesn't seem possible.

Actually, I realize that I've been overthinking this. Let's be systematic. We have EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

If TPP(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper part of z (i.e., y is inside z and y ≠ z) and y touches the boundary of z.

If EC(x,y), then x is externally connected to y. This means x is outside of y, and x touches the boundary of y.

Now, the boundary of y has two parts: the part that's inside z and the part that's on the boundary of z. Where x touches y will determine the relationship between x and z:

1. If x touches y at a point on the boundary of z, then x would also touch z at that point, making EC(x,z) true.
2. If x touches y at a point inside z, then x would have a point inside z. This gives us more options:
   a. If x is mostly outside z with just a part inside, then PO(x,z) is true.
   b. If x is entirely inside z and touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) is true.
   c. If x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) is true.

Is it possible for x to be entirely outside of z and only touch y at a point that's inside z? No, because if y is inside z and x touches y, then x must also have at least that touching point inside z. So x can't be entirely outside of z, which means DC(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:

- EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
- NTPP(x,z): x is part of z but does not touch z's boundary.

These are my final and confirmed answers.

Actually, let me just draw out a diagram for DC(x,z) to double check. Imagine z as a big circle, and y as a smaller circle inside z that touches z's boundary at a single point p. Now, imagine x as a circle that's entirely outside of z, but touches y at the same point p.

In this case, EC(x,y) would be true because x and y touch at a point on their boundaries. TPP(y,z) would be true because y is inside z and touches z's boundary. But would DC(x,z) be true? If x touches y at point p, and point p is on the boundary of z, then x would also touch z at point p, making EC(x,z) true, not DC(x,z).

Wait, if EC(x,y), then x and y share a boundary point, e.g., p. If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches the boundary of z, e.g., at point q. If p and q are the same point, then x also touches z at that point, making EC(x,z) true. But if p and q are different points, and p is a point on y's boundary that's inside z, then x would also have a point (p) inside z. In this case, DC(x,z) is not possible.

So, I'm sticking with my conclusion that the possible relationships between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) are:

- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what relationships are possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let's understand what these relations mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is inside z and touches z's boundary

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. EC(x,z): This is possible if x touches y at the point where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x would be outside z except for this boundary point.

2. PO(x,z): This is possible if x partially extends inside z. This happens when x touches y at a point inside z, and x has parts both inside and outside z.

3. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. This can happen when x touches y at some point inside z.

4. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This occurs when x touches y at a point that's not on z's boundary.

5. DC(x,z): This is NOT possible. If x touches y, and y is inside z, then x must have at least one point that either touches z or is inside z.

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
