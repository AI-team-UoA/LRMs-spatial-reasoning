PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We're given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- TPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of TPP(y,z), so it means z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So both x and z are parts of y, and both touch y's boundary. Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's analyze the possibilities one by one:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is possible. Even though both x and z are parts of y, they could be completely disconnected from each other within y, as long as they both touch y's boundary.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is possible. Both x and z could touch at their boundaries without sharing any interior points, while both being parts of y and touching y's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is possible. x and z could share some parts but not be completely contained in one another, while both being parts of y and touching y's boundary.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x could be properly contained in z, and both x and z could touch y's boundary. For example, if z forms a "ring" inside y touching y's boundary, and x is a small region inside that ring that also touches y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is not possible. If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x would not touch the boundary of z. But we know x touches the boundary of y. Since z is a proper part of y, the boundary of z that's not shared with y is strictly inside y. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, it can't touch the boundary of y, which contradicts TPP(x,y).

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible, by similar reasoning to TPP(x,z).

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible, by similar reasoning to NTPP(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is possible. Both x and z could be the same region, which is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.

Let me double-check the cases I marked as not possible: NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z):
If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely in the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But since z is a proper part of y, the interior of z is a subset of the interior of y. So, x is in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. But this contradicts TPP(x,y).

For NTPPi(x,z):
If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely in the interior of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. But since x is a proper part of y, the interior of x is a subset of the interior of y. So, z is in the interior of y and doesn't touch y's boundary. But this contradicts TPPi(y,z), which means z touches y's boundary.

Actually, let me reconsider. I think there's a mistake in my reasoning above. Let's define these relationships more carefully:

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is a proper part of y (all of x is in y, but y is not completely covered by x), and x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z: y is a proper part of z (all of y is in z, but z is not completely covered by y), and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, let's analyze the relationships again:

From TPP(x,y), we know that x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary.
From TPPi(y,z), we know that y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.

Since y is a part of z, and x is a part of y, by transitivity, x is a part of z. But the question is: what kind of relationship does x have with z?

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is not possible. If x is part of y and y is part of z, then x is part of z, so they can't be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is not possible for the same reason as DC. If x is part of z, they can't just touch at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is not possible. If x is part of z, then all of x is in z, not just a part of it, so they don't "partially" overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x is a proper part of z (as established by transitivity), and x could touch the boundary of z. This happens when x touches the boundary of y, and that part of y's boundary is also a part of z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x is a proper part of z, and it's possible that x doesn't touch the boundary of z. This happens when x touches a part of y's boundary that's in the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible. If y is a proper part of z, and x is a proper part of y, then z can't be a part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is not possible. If x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z, not equal to z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Let's actually triple-check this.

From TPP(x,y), we know:
- x is a proper part of y, meaning all of x is in y, but y is not completely covered by x.
- x touches the boundary of y.

From TPPi(y,z), which is the same as TPP(z,y), we know:
- y is a proper part of z, meaning all of y is in z, but z is not completely covered by y.
- y touches the boundary of z.

I think I need to be more careful about what "y touches the boundary of z" means when TPPi(y,z). This doesn't mean that y is at z's outer boundary, but rather that z is at y's outer boundary, since TPPi(y,z) is the same as TPP(z,y).

So, for TPPi(y,z), it means z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

But now that creates a logical inconsistency with the original conditions. If TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, and TPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y, then x and z are both proper parts of y. This doesn't tell us directly the relationship between x and z.

Let me double-check the definition of TPPi:
TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), so it means that z is a tangential proper part of y.

This means that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. In this case, the relationships between x and z can be:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is possible. Both x and z can be separate regions within y that don't share any points.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries without sharing any interior points.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is possible. x and z can share some parts but not be completely contained in one another.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is possible. x and z can be the same region.

So, all relationships are possible.

But wait, that can't be right. Let me revisit the definitions and apply more constraint-based reasoning.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y, meaning all of x is in y, but y is not completely covered by x.
- x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means:
- z is a proper part of y, meaning all of z is in y, but y is not completely covered by z.
- z touches the boundary of y.

Given these, both x and z are proper parts of y. Now, let's analyze the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is possible. Both x and z can be separate regions within y.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is possible. x and z can share some parts.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be a proper part of z and touch z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be a proper part of z and not touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is possible. x and z can be the same region.

So, all relationships are possible between x and z.

But I think I still need to be more careful with the constraints. Let's rethink this.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y, meaning all of x is in y, but y is not completely covered by x.
- x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y, which is the same as TPP(z,y):
- z is a proper part of y, meaning all of z is in y, but y is not completely covered by z.
- z touches the boundary of y.

So, both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. They are both proper parts of y and both touch the boundary of y.

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is possible. x and z can be separate regions within y, both touching the boundary of y.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries, both being proper parts of y and touching the boundary of y.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is possible. x and z can share some parts but not be completely contained in one another, both being proper parts of y and touching the boundary of y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be a proper part of z, touching z's boundary, and both x and z can be proper parts of y, touching y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be a proper part of z without touching z's boundary, and both x and z can be proper parts of y, touching y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be a proper part of x, touching x's boundary, and both x and z can be proper parts of y, touching y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be a proper part of x without touching x's boundary, and both x and z can be proper parts of y, touching y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is possible. x and z can be the same region, both being a proper part of y and touching the boundary of y.

Upon further reflection, all these relationships are possible between x and z, given the constraints. The key is that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y, but this doesn't constrain their relationship with each other in a way that excludes any of the RCC8 relations.

Wait, I think I might still be confused about the meaning of TPPi. Let me double-check. 

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y: x is a proper part of y, and x touches y's boundary.

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), so it means y is a tangential proper part of x: y is a proper part of x, and y touches x's boundary.

So, TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y: z is a proper part of y, and z touches y's boundary.

No, that doesn't seem right. If TPPi is the inverse of TPP, then TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, not the other way around. So, TPPi(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z.
- y touches the boundary of z.

Given this clarification, let's revise the setup:

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y.
- x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means:
- y is a proper part of z.
- y touches the boundary of z.

Now, since x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, by transitivity, x is a proper part of z. But what kind of proper part is x to z?

If x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, it's not clear if x touches the boundary of z. It depends on the exact configuration.

Let's analyze the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is not possible. If x is a part of y and y is a part of z, then x is a part of z, so they can't be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is not possible for the same reason as DC. If x is a part of z, they can't just touch at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is not possible. If x is a part of z, then all of x is in z, not just a part of it, so they don't "partially" overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. If x touches the boundary of y, and that part of y's boundary is also a part of z's boundary, then x touches the boundary of z. This means x is a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. If x touches a part of y's boundary that's in the interior of z, then x doesn't touch the boundary of z. This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible. If x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, then z can't be a part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is not possible. If x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z, not equal to z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me think a bit more carefully about the reasoning here.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Let's think about the possible positions of x relative to z.

We know that x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z. By transitivity, x is a proper part of z. The question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

Since TPP(x,y), x touches the boundary of y. And since TPPi(y,z), y touches the boundary of z. 

If x touches a part of y's boundary that also forms a part of z's boundary, then x touches the boundary of z, which means TPP(x,z). If x touches a part of y's boundary that's in the interior of z, then x doesn't touch the boundary of z, which means NTPP(x,z).

Both scenarios are possible. Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

To make sure, let me use some concrete examples or mental models to check my reasoning.

Example 1: Concentric circles. Let z be the outermost circle, y be a smaller circle inside z but touching the boundary of z, and x be an even smaller circle inside y, touching the boundary of y exactly where y touches the boundary of z. In this case, TPP(x,y), TPPi(y,z), and TPP(x,z).

Example 2: Concentric circles again. Let z be the outermost circle, y be a smaller circle inside z but touching the boundary of z, and x be an even smaller circle inside y, touching the boundary of y at a point that's in the interior of z. In this case, TPP(x,y), TPPi(y,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Based on these examples, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me really make sure I understand TPPi correctly. TPPi is the inverse of TPP, which means the roles of the two entities are switched. So, if TPP(x,y) means "x is a tangential proper part of y", then TPPi(x,y) means "y is a tangential proper part of x".

In our case, TPPi(y,z) means "z is a tangential proper part of y", or equivalently, TPP(z,y). But this creates an inconsistency. If TPP(x,y) means x is a proper part of y, and TPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y, then both x and z are proper parts of y. This doesn't tell us anything about the relationship between x and z directly.

Let me double-check the standard definition of TPPi:

TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y). So, if TPP(x,y) means "x is a tangential proper part of y", then TPPi(x,y) means "y is a tangential proper part of x".

Given this, TPPi(y,z) means "z is a tangential proper part of y". 

So, we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(y,z): z is a tangential proper part of y.

In this case, both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. This means both x and z are proper parts of y and touch the boundary of y. This arrangement does not directly dictate the relationship between x and z.

So, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is possible. Both x and z can be separate regions within y, both touching the boundary of y.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries, both being proper parts of y and touching the boundary of y.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is possible. x and z can share some parts but not be completely contained in one another, both being proper parts of y and touching the boundary of y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be a proper part of z, touching z's boundary, and both x and z can be proper parts of y, touching y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be a proper part of z without touching z's boundary, and both x and z can be proper parts of y, touching y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be a proper part of x, touching x's boundary, and both x and z can be proper parts of y, touching y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be a proper part of x without touching x's boundary, and both x and z can be proper parts of y, touching y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is possible. x and z can be the same region, both being a proper part of y and touching the boundary of y.

So, it seems like all of the RCC8 relations are possible between x and z.

Actually, I think I made a mistake again.

Let me revisit the exact definitions and implications of TPP and TPPi.

TPP(x,y) means "x is a tangential proper part of y", which implies:
- x is a proper part of y, meaning all of x is in y, but y is not completely covered by x.
- x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(x,y) means "y is a tangential proper part of x", which implies:
- y is a proper part of x, meaning all of y is in x, but x is not completely covered by y.
- y touches the boundary of x.

So, TPPi(y,z) means "z is a tangential proper part of y", which implies:
- z is a proper part of y, meaning all of z is in y, but y is not completely covered by z.
- z touches the boundary of y.

Oh, I see the source of my confusion. TPPi doesn't mean "the second entity is a tangential proper part of the first", but rather "the second entity stands in the tangential proper part relationship to the first". In other words, TPPi(y,z) means "z stands in the TPP relationship to y", or TPP(z,y).

So, we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

Both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. This means both x and z are proper parts of y and touch the boundary of y. Given this, there's no direct constraint on the relationship between x and z.

Hence, all of the RCC8 relations are potentially possible between x and z.

Wait, let me make one more check. The "i" in "TPPi" stands for "inverse". The inverse of the tangential proper part relation is the relationship where the roles of the two entities are swapped. So, if TPP(x,y) means "x is a tangential proper part of y", then TPPi(x,y) means "y is a tangential proper part of x".

In our case, TPPi(y,z) means "z is a tangential proper part of y". 

So, we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

Both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. Let's explore the implications for the relationship between x and z:

- DC(x,z): This means x and z are disjoint. This is possible. For example, if y is a circle and both x and z are small non-overlapping circles touching the boundary of y from the inside.

- EC(x,z): This means x and z only touch at their boundaries. This is possible. For example, if y is a circle and both x and z are small tangent circles, both touching the boundary of y from the inside.

- PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible. For example, if y is a circle and both x and z are overlapping circles, both touching the boundary of y from the inside.

- TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z. This is possible. For example, if y is a circle, z is a smaller circle touching the boundary of y from the inside, and x is an even smaller circle touching the boundary of z exactly where z touches the boundary of y.

- NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This is possible. For example, if y is a circle, z is a smaller circle touching the boundary of y from the inside, and x is an even smaller circle inside z, not touching the boundary of z.

- TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible, similar to the example for TPP(x,z), but with x and z swapped.

- NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible, similar to the example for NTPP(x,z), but with x and z swapped.

- EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is possible. For example, if x and z are the same tangential proper part of y.

Based on this, all eight of the RCC8 relations are possible between x and z.

Actually, I think there might still be a confusion on my part. Let me reconsider the definitions and the implications.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y, meaning all of x is in y, but y is not completely covered by x.
- x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means:
- y is a tangential proper part of z, which is the same as TPP(y,z).
- So, y is a proper part of z, and y touches the boundary of z.

Now, since x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, by transitivity, x is a proper part of z. But whether x touches the boundary of z depends on the exact configuration.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is not possible. If x is a proper part of z, they cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is not possible. If x is a proper part of z, they cannot just touch at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is not possible. If x is a proper part of z, then all of x is in z, not just a part of it, so they don't "partially" overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. If x touches a part of y's boundary that also forms a part of z's boundary, then x touches the boundary of z, making x a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. If x doesn't touch any part of z's boundary, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible. If x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, then z cannot be a proper part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is not possible. If x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z, not equal to z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

I think I initially made an error in interpreting TPPi. Let me be clearer:

TPP(x,y) means "x is a tangential proper part of y". TPPi(x,y) is the inverse of TPP(x,y), which means "y is a tangential proper part of x".

So, TPPi(y,z) means "z is a tangential proper part of y", which is the same as TPP(z,y).

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y.

So, both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. They're both "inside" y, touching y's boundary. But this doesn't tell us directly how x and z relate to each other.

If they're both inside y, they could be in different parts of y, overlapping, or one could be inside the other. Let's check all possibilities:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is possible. They can be separate regions within y, both touching the boundary of y.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is possible. They can touch at their boundaries, both being inside y and touching the boundary of y.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is possible. They can share some parts but not be completely contained in one another.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be inside z, touching the boundary of z, while both are inside y and touching the boundary of y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be inside z, not touching the boundary of z, while both are inside y and touching the boundary of y.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be inside x, touching the boundary of x, while both are inside y and touching the boundary of y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be inside x, not touching the boundary of x, while both are inside y and touching the boundary of y.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is possible. x and z can be the same region, both being inside y and touching the boundary of y.

So, all of the RCC8 relations are possible between x and z, given that both x and z are tangential proper parts of y.

Now I think I need to be even more precise with the definitions.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y, meaning P(x,y) and not P(y,x).
- x touches the boundary of y, meaning some point of x is on the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means:
- z is a tangential proper part of y, meaning TPP(z,y).
- So, z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

Now, let's carefully consider the possible relationships between x and z when both are tangential proper parts of y.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is possible. x and z can be separate non-overlapping regions within y.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries without having common interior points.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is possible. x and z can share some interior points but neither is a part of the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be entirely within z, touching the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. x can be entirely within the interior of z, not touching the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be entirely within x, touching the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. z can be entirely within the interior of x, not touching the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is possible. x and z can be the same region.

So, based on the definitions and constraints, all of the RCC8 relations are possible between x and z.

But wait, I'm still confused about the meaning of TPPi. Let me revisit the standard definition.

TPP(x,y) means "x is a tangential proper part of y", which implies x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) is the inverse of TPP(y,z), which means "z is a tangential proper part of y", so TPPi(y,z) is equivalent to TPP(z,y).

TPP(z,y) means z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

Now, with the clarified meanings:

- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- TPP(z,y): z is a proper part of y, and z touches the boundary of y.

Both x and z are proper parts of y, touching the boundary of y. This doesn't constrain the relationship between x and z in a way that excludes any of the RCC8 relations.

Let's consider a few concrete examples to check if all relations are possible:

1. DC(x,z):
   Imagine y as a square. Place a small circle x in the top-left corner, touching the boundary of y. Place another small circle z in the bottom-right corner, also touching the boundary of y. x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z):
   Imagine y as a square. Place a small circle x in the top-left corner, touching the boundary of y. Place another small circle z adjacent to x, also touching the boundary of y, such that x and z touch at a single point.

3. PO(x,z):
   Imagine y as a square. Place two overlapping circles x and z, both touching the boundary of y, but neither is entirely within the other.

4. TPP(x,z):
   Imagine y as a square. Place a circle z touching the boundary of y. Inside z, place a smaller circle x touching both the boundary of z and the boundary of y.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   Imagine y as a square. Place a circle z touching the boundary of y. Inside z, place a smaller circle x that doesn't touch the boundary of z but does touch the boundary of y.

Wait, I think I found a contradiction. If x is inside z, and z touches the boundary of y, and x also touches the boundary of y, then x must touch the boundary of z at the point where z touches the boundary of y. So, if x is a proper part of z, it can't be a non-tangential proper part (NTPP); it must be a tangential proper part (TPP).

Let me reconsider the configurations.

For TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y), both x and z are tangential proper parts of y. This means they both touch the boundary of y.

If x is a proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of y, then x must touch the boundary of z at the point where z touches the boundary of y. This means x is a tangential proper part of z, so TPP(x,z).

If z is a proper part of x, and z touches the boundary of y, then z must touch the boundary of x at the point where x touches the boundary of y. This means z is a tangential proper part of x, so TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

So, if one is a proper part of the other, it must be a tangential proper part. But the other relations (DC, EC, PO, EQ) can still be possible.

Let's check again, more carefully:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is possible. Imagine y as a square. Place a small circle x in the top-left corner, touching the boundary of y. Place another small circle z in the bottom-right corner, also touching the boundary of y. x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connected:
   This is possible. Imagine y as a square. Place a small circle x in the top-left corner, touching the boundary of y. Place another small circle z adjacent to x, also touching the boundary of y, such that x and z touch at a single point.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is possible. Imagine y as a square. Place two overlapping circles x and z, both touching the boundary of y, but neither is entirely within the other.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. Imagine y as a square. Place a circle z touching the boundary of y. Inside z, place a smaller circle x touching both the boundary of z and the boundary of y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is not possible. If x is a proper part of z, and x touches the boundary of y, then x must touch the boundary of z at the point where z touches the boundary of y. This means x is a tangential proper part of z, not a non-tangential proper part.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is possible. Imagine y as a square. Place a circle x touching the boundary of y. Inside x, place a smaller circle z touching both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible, for the same reason as NTPP.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is possible. x and z can be the same region, touching the boundary of y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Wait, I think I misunderstood the constraints. TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is inside y, touching the boundary of y. TPP(z,y) means z is inside y, touching the boundary of y.

If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z, not touching the boundary of z. But if x touches the boundary of y, and z also touches the boundary of y, and x is inside z, then x must touch the boundary of z at the point where z touches the boundary of y. This contradicts NTPP(x,z). Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. We have TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z). TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y.

For TPP(x,y), x is inside y, touching the boundary of y. For TPP(z,y), z is inside y, touching the boundary of y. So, both x and z are inside y, touching the boundary of y.

Now, if x is completely inside z (i.e., x is a proper part of z), and x touches the boundary of y, and z also touches the boundary of y, then x must touch the boundary of z at the point where z touches the boundary of y. This means x is a tangential proper part of z, so TPP(x,z).

Similarly, if z is completely inside x, it must be a tangential proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z).

Now, for x and z to be in a non-tangential relationship (NTPP or NTPPi), one would have to be completely inside the other without touching the boundary of the other. But, as we just reasoned, this can't happen due to the constraints of both touching the boundary of y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ, but not NTPP or NTPPi.

Wait, I think I missed something.

Let's consider the NTPP case more carefully. If NTPP(x,z), then x is completely inside the interior of z, not touching the boundary of z. Now, if TPP(x,y), then x touches the boundary of y.

Given that x is inside z and x touches the boundary of y, then z must also touch the boundary of y at the same point. This is consistent with TPP(z,y).

But I mistakenly thought that if x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of y, and z touches the boundary of y, then x must touch the boundary of z. But this isn't necessarily the case. Imagine z as a "thick" region that has part of the boundary of y as its own boundary. The interior of z can also touch the boundary of y. So, x can be inside the interior of z, touching the boundary of y, without touching the boundary of z.

For example, imagine y as a square, and z as a rectangular region inside y, touching the top side of y. Now, place a circle x inside z, also touching the top side of y. x is inside z, but it doesn't have to touch the boundary of z (except for the part that coincides with the boundary of y).

So, NTPP(x,z) is possible if x is inside z, and both x and z touch the same part of the boundary of y.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is possible if z is inside x, and both touch the same part of the boundary of y.

So, all of the RCC8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z, given the constraints.

Actually, I just realized another issue. If NTPP(x,z), then x is inside the interior of z, not touching the boundary of z. But the boundary of z includes the part where z touches y. If x also touches y, and x is inside z, then x touches a part of the boundary of z, which contradicts NTPP(x,z).

To be more precise: If NTPP(x,z), then x is inside the interior of z, not touching the boundary of z. The boundary of z includes the part where z touches y. If x touches y at the same point where z touches y, then x is touching the boundary of z, which contradicts NTPP(x,z).

The same reasoning applies to NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are DC, EC, PO, TPP, TPPi, and EQ, but not NTPP or NTPPi.

Actually, wait. I need to be more precise about the boundaries.

If z touches the boundary of y, it means there's a point p on the boundary of y such that p is also a point of z. Similarly, if x touches the boundary of y, there's a point q on the boundary of y such that q is also a point of x.

Now, the key is to understand whether p and q are the same point or different points. If they're the same point, then x and z touch at that point, which means x touches the boundary of z (if x is inside z) or z touches the boundary of x (if z is inside x). But if p and q are different points, then x and z can have a non-tangential relationship.

For example, imagine y as a square, z as a rectangle inside y touching the top side of y, and x as a circle inside z touching the right side of y. x is inside z, and both touch the boundary of y, but at different points. In this case, x can be inside the interior of z without touching the boundary of z, making NTPP(x,z) possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is possible if z is inside the interior of x, and they touch different parts of the boundary of y.

So, all of the RCC8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z, given the constraints.

Ok, I just realized I need to be even more precise about the boundary relationships.

Let's denote the boundary of a region r as bd(r). If TPP(x,y), then x ∩ bd(y) ≠ ∅, meaning x touches the boundary of y. Similarly, if TPP(z,y), then z ∩ bd(y) ≠ ∅.

Now, if NTPP(x,z), then x is inside the interior of z, not touching the boundary of z. This means x ∩ bd(z) = ∅.

The question is: If x touches the boundary of y, and z touches the boundary of y, and x is inside the interior of z, can x avoid touching the boundary of z?

Let's think about it. The boundary of z, bd(z), is a closed curve (or surface in 3D). A part of this boundary can coincide with the boundary of y, bd(y). If x touches bd(y) at a point that's also a part of bd(z), then x touches bd(z), which contradicts NTPP(x,z).

But what if x touches bd(y) at a point that's not a part of bd(z)? Is this possible? If z touches bd(y) at one point, but not at the point where x touches bd(y), and x is inside z, then x is touching a point of bd(y) that's in the interior of z. This means the interior of z includes a part of bd(y), which is a bit strange. Generally, the interior of a region doesn't include parts of the boundary of its containing region.

However, this might be a matter of how exactly the "interior" and "boundary" are defined in the RCC8 calculus. If we allow the interior of a region to include parts of the boundary of its containing region, then NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) can be possible.

Given the standard interpretation of RCC8, where regions are regular closed sets, and the boundary is defined as the difference between the closure and the interior, I'm inclined to believe that NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible under the given constraints. But I'm not entirely certain.

Let me try to reason from the definitions of the RCC8 relations to be sure.

In RCC8, we have:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, touching only at the boundary.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning x is a proper part of y and doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal.

Given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), or equivalently, TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y), we know:
- x is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.
- z is a proper part of y and touches the boundary of y.

Let me try to check each relation one by one.

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected: This is possible. x and z can be disjoint regions inside y, both touching the boundary of y at different points.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected: This is possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries without overlapping, both being inside y and touching the boundary of y.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap: This is possible. x and z can share some parts but neither is a part of the other, both being inside y and touching the boundary of y.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z: This is possible. x can be a proper part of z, touching the boundary of z, while both are inside y and touching the boundary of y.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z: This is possible if x touches the boundary of y at a point that's in the interior of z. But if the interior of z can't include parts of the boundary of y, then NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

I'm not entirely certain, but I think the interior of a region can include parts of the boundary of its containing region. For example, consider a square y and a slightly smaller square z inside y, with z touching the top side of y. The interior of z includes parts of the top side of y. Now, place a circle x inside z, also touching the top side of y. x is inside the interior of z, not touching the boundary of z (except at the part that coincides with the boundary of y). So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is possible. For EQ(x,z), it's clearly possible if x and z are the same region inside y, touching the boundary of y.

So, all of the RCC8 relations (DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are possible between x and z, given the constraints.

Actually, let me try to be more precise about the definition of NTPP. In RCC8, NTPP(x,y) means "x is a non-tangential proper part of y", which implies that x is a proper part of y and x doesn't touch the boundary of y.

So, if NTPP(x,z), then x doesn't touch the boundary of z. But if x touches the boundary of y, and z also touches the boundary of y, and x is inside z, then x might be touching the boundary of z at the point where z touches the boundary of y. This would contradict NTPP(x,z).

But it's also possible that x touches the boundary of y at a point that's in the interior of z, not on the boundary of z. If the interior of z can include parts of the boundary of y, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Given the standard interpretation of RCC8, I believe all of the RCC8 relations are possible between x and z, given the constraints of TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y).

I'll summarize the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. x and z can be separate regions within y, both touching the boundary of y.
2. EC(x,z): Possible. x and z can touch at their boundaries, both being inside y and touching the boundary of y.
3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can share some parts but neither is a part of the other, both being inside y and touching the boundary of y.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a proper part of z, touching the boundary of z, while both are inside y and touching the boundary of y.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be a proper part of z, not touching the boundary of z, while both are inside y and touching the boundary of y at different points.
6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a proper part of x, touching the boundary of x, while both are inside y and touching the boundary of y.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be a proper part of x, not touching the boundary of x, while both are inside y and touching the boundary of y at different points.
8. EQ(x,z): Possible. x and z can be the same region inside y, touching the boundary of y.

So, all of the RCC8 relations are possible between x and z, given the constraints of TPP(x,y) and TPP(z,y).

Actually, I need to re-read the original question to make sure I've been solving the right problem.

Original question: "If TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?"

Alright, the question says TPPi(y,z), not TPP(z,y). Let me make sure I understand the implications.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, which implies x is a proper part of y, meaning all of x is in y, but y is not completely covered by x, and x touches the boundary of y.

TPPi(y,z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, which implies y is a proper part of z, meaning all of y is in z, but z is not completely covered by y, and y touches the boundary of z.

Given these, x is a part of y, and y is a part of z, so by transitivity, x is a part of z. The question is: what kind of relationship does x have with z?

Let's check each of the RCC8 relations to see if they're possible:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   This is not possible. If x is a part of z, they cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected:
   This is not possible. If x is a part of z, they cannot just touch at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   This is not possible. If x is a part of z, then all of x is in z, not just a part of it, so they don't "partially" overlap.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. If x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z, and that part of y's boundary coincides with a part of z's boundary, then x touches the boundary of z. This makes x a tangential proper part of z.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   This is possible. If x touches a part of y's boundary that's in the interior of z, then x doesn't touch the boundary of z. This makes x a non-tangential proper part of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible. If x is a part of y and y is a part of z, then z cannot be a part of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   This is not possible. If x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z, then x is a proper part of z, not equal to z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check with a concrete example. Imagine three concentric circles: z as the outermost, y in the middle, and x as the innermost. In this case, TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z). If y touches the boundary of z at a point, and x touches the boundary of y at the same point, then x also touches the boundary of z, making TPP(x,z). But if y touches the boundary of z at a point, and x touches the boundary of y at a different point, then x might not touch the boundary of z, making NTPP(x,z).

So, indeed, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

To summarize: The possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) are TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to carefully analyze what happens when we have TPP(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a tangential proper part of y
- x is completely inside y
- x touches y's boundary

TPPi(y,z) means:
- y is a tangential proper part of z
- y is completely inside z
- y touches z's boundary

Given these conditions, I can deduce:
- Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x must be inside z (transitivity of proper part relation)
- x is definitely a proper part of z

The question is whether x touches the boundary of z or not.

There are two possible scenarios:
1. If x touches y's boundary at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x also touches z's boundary. This gives us TPP(x,z).

2. If x touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x is completely in the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This gives us NTPP(x,z).

Both scenarios are possible depending on the exact configuration, and these are the only possible relationships.

### Answer: TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
