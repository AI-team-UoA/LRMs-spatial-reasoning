PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this problem step by step.

We have two given relationships:
1. NTPPi(x,y) - this means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z) - this means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

We need to determine what relationship could exist between x and z.

Let me visualize these relationships:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary

Now, to determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to consider how x and z can be positioned relative to each other, given these constraints.

Since y is completely inside x and also completely inside z (touching z's boundary), there are several possibilities for how x and z could relate:

1. x could be completely inside z (not touching z's boundary) -> NTPP(x,z)
2. x could be completely inside z (touching z's boundary) -> TPP(x,z)
3. x and z could partially overlap -> PO(x,z)
4. x could completely contain z -> NTPPi(x,z) or TPPi(x,z)
5. x and z could be equal -> EQ(x,z)

Let's check each of these possibilities to see if they're consistent with our given information.

1. NTPP(x,z): 
   If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, then y is also completely inside z (since y is inside x). But we know that y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), so this is inconsistent. NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

2. TPP(x,z):
   If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then y is also inside z. Since y is inside x and not touching x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), and x touches z's boundary, it's possible for y to also touch z's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z):
   If x and z partially overlap, then y must be in the overlapping region (since y is inside both x and z). But y touches z's boundary, which means the overlapping region must reach z's boundary. This is consistent with our constraints, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. NTPPi(x,z) or TPPi(x,z):
   If x completely contains z, then z is inside x. But this contradicts the fact that y is inside z and touches z's boundary, because if z is inside x, then y would be doubly inside x and couldn't touch any boundary of x. So NTPPi(x,z) and TPPi(x,z) are not possible.

5. EQ(x,z):
   If x and z are equal, then y is inside both x and z. But y cannot simultaneously be a non-tangential proper part of x (not touching x's boundary) and a tangential proper part of z (touching z's boundary) if x and z are the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let's think about this again. We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, touching z's boundary

Let me try to draw this to get a better understanding:

For NTPPi(x,y), x completely contains y, and y doesn't touch x's boundary:
x: [   y   ]

For TPP(y,z), z completely contains y, and y touches z's boundary:
z: [y_]  (where _ indicates that y touches the boundary)

Combining these:

For NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z):
x: [   y   ]
z: [y_]

The question is, how can x and z relate to each other?

Given that y is inside both x and z, and y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, x and z must overlap in some way. The possibilities are:

1. x partially overlaps z (PO):
   x: [   y   ]
   z:    [y_]
   This is consistent with our constraints: y is inside both x and z, y doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary.

2. x is a tangential proper part of z (TPP):
   x: [   y   ]
   z: [   x   _]
   Again, this is consistent: y is inside both x and z, y doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary.

3. x equals z (EQ):
   If x equals z, then their boundaries are the same. But y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)) and doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), which is a contradiction. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

4. x is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP):
   x: [   y   ]
   z: [      x      ]
   In this case, y is inside x, which is inside z. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, and x doesn't touch z's boundary, y can't touch z's boundary. But we know that y does touch z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. z is a proper part of x (TPPi or NTPPi):
   x: [      z      ]
   z: [y_]
   If z is inside x, then y is inside z, which is inside x. Since y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), but z is inside x, y would still be separated from x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.

Hmm, there seems to be a discrepancy in my analysis. Let me think through this again, more carefully.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x, meaning y is completely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z, meaning y is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   If x and z are disconnected, they share no parts. But y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the part that is y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect:
   If x and z only touch at their boundaries, they don't share any interior parts. But y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   In this case, x and z share some parts, but neither is a part of the other. This is consistent with y being part of both x and z. Additionally, since y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, x and z can be arranged so that this is true. Therefore, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   In this case, x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is consistent with y being part of x, which is part of z. Additionally, since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, but x touches z's boundary, y can touch z's boundary through x. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   In this case, x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is inside x and y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), but x doesn't touch z's boundary, y can't touch z's boundary. This is a contradiction. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   In this case, z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and z touches x's boundary, y can be positioned so that it doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)). Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   In this case, z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since y is inside z and touches z's boundary, and z doesn't touch x's boundary, y doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   If x and z are equal, then their boundaries are the same. Since y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)) but doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), this is a contradiction. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let's do a quick check to confirm these:

For PO(x,z):
If x and z partially overlap, y must be in the overlapping region. Since y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, this constrains how x and z can overlap, but it doesn't make it impossible.

For TPP(x,z):
If x is a tangential proper part of z, y is inside x, which is inside z. Since y doesn't touch x's boundary, but x touches z's boundary, y can touch z's boundary only if it touches it at the same place x does. This seems problematic, as it would mean y touches both x's and z's boundaries at the same point. Let me reconsider this.

Wait, if y touches z's boundary at the same point where x touches z's boundary, then y would also be touching x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y). So TPP(x,z) is not possible after all.

For TPPi(x,z):
If z is a tangential proper part of x, y is inside z, which is inside x. Since y touches z's boundary and z touches x's boundary, y can be arranged so that it doesn't touch x's boundary.

For NTPPi(x,z):
If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, y is inside z, which is inside x. Since y touches z's boundary but z doesn't touch x's boundary, y doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent.

So, I believe the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I realized I made a mistake in my analysis of TPP(x,z). Let me reconsider this case more carefully.

For TPP(x,z) (x is a tangential proper part of z):
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- If x is inside z and touches z's boundary (TPP(x,z)), can y be inside x, not touch x's boundary, but still touch z's boundary?

Since y doesn't touch x's boundary but touches z's boundary, and x touches z's boundary, it seems like y would need to "reach out" from inside x to touch z's boundary without touching x's boundary. This isn't possible. If y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and x is inside z, then y must be separated from z's boundary by at least the distance from y to x's boundary. This means y can't touch z's boundary, contradicting TPP(y,z).

So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let me double-check the remaining possibilities:

For PO(x,z) (x and z partially overlap):
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- If x and z partially overlap, y must be in the overlapping region (since y is inside both x and z). But y touches z's boundary, which constrains where in the overlapping region y can be. Specifically, the overlapping region must include a part of z's boundary. But since y doesn't touch x's boundary, y must be away from x's boundary within this overlapping region. This is geometrically possible. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x):
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, then y is inside z, which is inside x. Since y touches z's boundary and z touches x's boundary, it's possible for y to touch z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch x's boundary. This is consistent with y not touching x's boundary. So TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x):
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
- If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then y is inside z, which is inside x. Since y touches z's boundary but z doesn't touch x's boundary, y is still separated from x's boundary. This is consistent with NTPPi(x,y). So NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, let me try a different approach to think about this. Let me think about the constraint each relation puts on the location of y.

1. NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
2. TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

For any possible relation between x and z, both of these constraints must be satisfied.

Let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   If x and z are disconnected, they share no parts. But y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the part that is y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect:
   If x and z only touch at their boundaries, they don't share any interior parts. But y is part of both x and z, so x and z must share interior parts. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   In this case, x and z share some parts, but neither is a part of the other. y must be in the overlapping region (since y is inside both x and z). Additionally, since y touches z's boundary but not x's boundary, the overlapping region must include a part of z's boundary, and y must be away from x's boundary within this region. This can be arranged, so PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   In this case, x is inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y is inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), y is also inside z. But for y to touch z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), it would have to touch the part of z's boundary that x touches. But then y would also be touching x's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   In this case, x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Since y is inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), y is also inside z. But for y to touch z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), it would have to extend beyond x's boundary, contradicting the fact that y is inside x. Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   In this case, z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since y is inside z (TPP(y,z)), y is also inside x. Since y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), y is near the boundary of z. But since z touches x's boundary at some points, we need to ensure that y doesn't touch x's boundary (to satisfy NTPPi(x,y)). This can be arranged if y touches z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch x's boundary. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   In this case, z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Since y is inside z (TPP(y,z)), y is also inside x. Since y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)) and z doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,z)), y doesn't touch x's boundary, satisfying NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   If x and z are equal, then their boundaries are the same. Since y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)) but doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), this is a contradiction. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

That is, x and z partially overlap, or z is a proper part of x (either tangential or non-tangential).

Actually, let me double-check the possibility of PO(x,z) again, because I'm not entirely confident in my analysis.

For PO(x,z) (x and z partially overlap):
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x and z partially overlap, y must be in the overlapping region (since y is inside both x and z). For this to be consistent with TPP(y,z), y must touch z's boundary. But the part of z's boundary that is inside x is not part of the boundary of the overlapping region. The boundary of the overlapping region consists of parts of x's boundary and parts of z's boundary. Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), y can't touch the part of the overlapping region's boundary that comes from x's boundary. But the part of the overlapping region's boundary that comes from z's boundary is not part of z's boundary that is inside x. So, y can't touch z's boundary while being inside the overlapping region, which contradicts TPP(y,z).

I realize there's some confusion in my analysis. Let me try to clarify this with a clearer visualization:

In the case of PO(x,z), the overlapping region has a boundary that consists of parts of x's boundary and parts of z's boundary. The part of z's boundary that is inside x is not part of the boundary of the overlapping region. Similarly, the part of x's boundary that is inside z is not part of the boundary of the overlapping region.

For y to satisfy NTPPi(x,y), y must be inside x and not touch x's boundary. For y to satisfy TPP(y,z), y must be inside z and touch z's boundary. If y is in the overlapping region, it can't touch z's boundary because the part of z's boundary that is inside x is not part of the boundary of the overlapping region.

But wait, that's not quite right. The part of z's boundary that is inside x is indeed not part of the boundary of the overlapping region, but it's still part of z's boundary. So, if y is in the overlapping region and touches the part of z's boundary that is inside x, it satisfies TPP(y,z) (y is inside z and touches z's boundary). And since this part of z's boundary is inside x, y doesn't touch x's boundary, satisfying NTPPi(x,y) (y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary).

So, PO(x,z) is indeed possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me try a different approach to analyze PO(x,z), because I'm still not confident in my analysis. If I have two overlapping regions, and a point that touches the boundary of one but not the other, where is that point?

Let's imagine x and z as two overlapping circles. The overlapping region is a lens shape. The boundary of this lens consists of two arcs: one from x's boundary and one from z's boundary.

If y is inside the lens (the overlapping region), then for y to touch z's boundary, it must touch the arc that is part of z's boundary. But this arc is also part of x's boundary. So, if y touches this arc, it touches both x's and z's boundaries, contradicting NTPPi(x,y).

But that's not the only possibility. If x and z overlap in a more complex way, there could be a part of z's boundary that is inside x but not part of the boundary of the overlapping region. For instance, if z has a concave shape that "dents into" x, then the part of z's boundary that forms this dent is inside x but not part of the boundary of the overlapping region. If y touches this part of z's boundary, it satisfies TPP(y,z) (y is inside z and touches z's boundary). And since this part of z's boundary is inside x, y doesn't touch x's boundary, satisfying NTPPi(x,y) (y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary).

So, PO(x,z) is possible, but it requires a specific arrangement where z has a concave shape that creates a part of its boundary inside x.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if the RCC-8 calculus allows for such complex shapes. If we're restricted to simple regions like circles or convex polygons, then PO(x,z) might not be possible.

Actually, let's approach this from yet another angle. 

Let's think about the constraints:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): y is inside z, touching z's boundary.

Now, let's focus on the boundary touch condition. For y to touch z's boundary, y must extend to z's boundary. If y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then for y to touch z's boundary, z's boundary must protrude inside x.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

For PO(x,z) (x and z partially overlap):
If x and z partially overlap, then their boundaries intersect. The overlapping region has a boundary that consists of parts of x's boundary and parts of z's boundary. For y to be inside x and not touch x's boundary, y must stay away from x's boundary. For y to be inside z and touch z's boundary, y must extend to z's boundary. These two conditions can only be met if there's a part of z's boundary that is inside x and not part of the boundary of the overlapping region.

This requires z to have a concave shape that "dents into" x, creating a part of z's boundary inside x. If y touches this part of z's boundary, it satisfies TPP(y,z) without touching x's boundary, thus satisfying NTPPi(x,y).

But if we're restricted to simple regions like circles or convex polygons, then such a concave shape isn't possible, and PO(x,z) might not be possible.

For TPPi(x,z) (z is a tangential proper part of x):
If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, then z's boundary consists of two parts: one that touches x's boundary and one that doesn't. For y to be inside z and touch z's boundary, y must extend to z's boundary. If y touches the part of z's boundary that doesn't touch x's boundary, then y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, satisfying NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) (z is a non-tangential proper part of x):
If z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then z's boundary is entirely inside x and away from x's boundary. For y to be inside z and touch z's boundary, y must extend to z's boundary. Since z's boundary is inside x and away from x's boundary, y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, satisfying NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

And PO(x,z) is only possible if we allow for non-convex shapes, which I don't think is standard in the RCC-8 calculus.

Actually, I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let's be very precise about the definitions of these relations.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is a proper subset of x's interior.

TPP(y,z) means that y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is a proper subset of z, and y shares at least one point with z's boundary.

Given these two constraints, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected:
   If x and z are disconnected, they share no points. But y is a subset of both x and z, so x and z must share at least the points in y. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z externally connect:
   If x and z only share boundary points, they don't share any interior points. But y is a subset of both x's interior and z's interior, so x and z must share interior points. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap:
   In this case, x and z share some points, but neither is a subset of the other. For this to be consistent with the given constraints, y must be in the overlapping region (since y is a subset of both x and z). 
   
   For NTPPi(x,y), y must be a proper subset of x's interior, meaning y doesn't share any points with x's boundary.
   
   For TPP(y,z), y must be a proper subset of z and share at least one point with z's boundary.
   
   Now, if y is in the overlapping region and doesn't touch x's boundary, can it touch z's boundary? The overlapping region's boundary consists of parts of x's boundary and parts of z's boundary. For a point in the overlapping region to touch z's boundary, it must touch the part of z's boundary that forms the boundary of the overlapping region. But this part of z's boundary is also part of the boundary of the overlapping region, which means it's either part of x's boundary or outside of x. If it's part of x's boundary, then y touching it would contradict NTPPi(x,y). If it's outside of x, then y can't reach it while staying inside x.
   
   Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z:
   In this case, x is a proper subset of z, and x shares at least one point with z's boundary. Since y is a proper subset of x's interior (NTPPi(x,y)), y is also a proper subset of z's interior. But for y to share a point with z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), it would have to share a point with the part of z's boundary that x touches. But then y would also be sharing a point with x's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z:
   In this case, x is a proper subset of z's interior. Since y is a proper subset of x's interior (NTPPi(x,y)), y is also a proper subset of z's interior. But for y to share a point with z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), it would have to extend beyond x's interior, contradicting NTPPi(x,y). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x:
   In this case, z is a proper subset of x, and z shares at least one point with x's boundary. Since y is a proper subset of z (TPP(y,z)), y is also a proper subset of x. Since y shares a point with z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), and z's boundary consists of the part that touches x's boundary and the part that doesn't, y must touch the part of z's boundary that doesn't touch x's boundary (to satisfy NTPPi(x,y)). This is geometrically possible. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x:
   In this case, z is a proper subset of x's interior. Since y is a proper subset of z (TPP(y,z)), y is also a proper subset of x's interior, satisfying NTPPi(x,y). Since y shares a point with z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), and z's boundary is entirely inside x's interior, y doesn't share any points with x's boundary. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal:
   If x and z are equal, then their boundaries are the same. Since y shares a point with z's boundary (TPP(y,z)) but doesn't share any points with x's boundary (NTPPi(x,y)), this is a contradiction. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I'm still not confident in my analysis of PO(x,z). Let me try a different approach.

For PO(x,z), x and z share some points, but neither is a subset of the other. This means there are points in x that are not in z, and points in z that are not in x. The overlapping region is the set of points that are in both x and z.

For y to satisfy NTPPi(x,y), y must be a proper subset of x's interior, meaning y doesn't share any points with x's boundary.

For y to satisfy TPP(y,z), y must be a proper subset of z and share at least one point with z's boundary.

Now, if y is in the overlapping region and doesn't touch x's boundary, can it touch z's boundary? The overlapping region's boundary consists of parts of x's boundary and parts of z's boundary. For a point in the overlapping region to touch z's boundary, it must touch the part of z's boundary that forms the boundary of the overlapping region. But this part of z's boundary is also part of the boundary of the overlapping region, which means it's either part of x's boundary or outside of x. If it's part of x's boundary, then y touching it would contradict NTPPi(x,y). If it's outside of x, then y can't reach it while staying inside x.

So, if y is in the overlapping region, it can't touch z's boundary while not touching x's boundary. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

I think my final answer is:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

That is, z is a proper part of x, either tangential or non-tangential.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating the analysis of PO(x,z). Let me try once more with a clearer visualization.

For PO(x,z), imagine two overlapping circles. The overlapping region is a lens shape. The boundary of this lens consists of two arcs: one from x's boundary and one from z's boundary.

For y to satisfy NTPPi(x,y), y must be inside x and away from x's boundary. For y to satisfy TPP(y,z), y must be inside z and touch z's boundary.

If y is in the overlapping region, it's inside both x and z. But for y to touch z's boundary, it must touch the arc of the lens that is part of z's boundary. However, that arc is also part of the boundary of the overlapping region, which means it's either part of x's boundary or outside of x. If it's part of x's boundary, then y touching it would contradict NTPPi(x,y). If it's outside of x, then y can't reach it while staying inside x.

Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

That is, z is a proper part of x, either tangential or non-tangential.

I've analyzed this problem multiple times and I believe these are the correct answers.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me analyze what these conditions mean:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (y is inside x, not touching x's boundary)
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z (y is inside z, touching z's boundary)

Considering each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Impossible - since y is part of both x and z, they cannot be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Impossible - x and z must share interior points (specifically y).

3. PO(x,z): Impossible - if x and z partially overlap, y would have to be in the overlapping region. For y to touch z's boundary while staying inside x and not touching x's boundary is geometrically impossible.

4. TPP(x,z): Impossible - if x is inside z touching z's boundary, then y would have to touch z's boundary at the same point x does, which would mean y touches x's boundary (contradicting NTPPi(x,y)).

5. NTPP(x,z): Impossible - if x is completely inside z not touching z's boundary, then y cannot touch z's boundary without extending beyond x.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be inside x touching x's boundary, and y can touch z's boundary at points where z doesn't touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be completely inside x not touching x's boundary, and y can touch z's boundary while still being inside x away from x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Impossible - if x equals z, their boundaries would be identical, so y cannot touch one boundary but not the other.

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
