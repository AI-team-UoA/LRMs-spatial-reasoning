PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.

2. EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about the spatial configuration:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- z is outside y but touches y's boundary

What are the possible ways x and z can relate?

Case 1: Since y touches the boundary of x, and z touches the boundary of y, it's possible that z is completely outside of x but touches x's boundary at the same point where y touches x's boundary. This would make x and z externally connected, so EC(x,z) is one possibility.

Case 2: It's also possible that z could partially overlap with x. Since z touches y, and y is inside x touching its boundary, z could extend partially into x and partially outside x. This would make x and z partially overlapping, so PO(x,z) is another possibility.

Case 3: z could be completely outside x without touching x. This would make x and z disconnected, so DC(x,z) is another possibility.

Case 4: Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPP)? If z is inside x and touches x's boundary, while also touching y (which is also inside x touching x's boundary), then TPP(z,x) would be possible.

Case 5: Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP)? No, because EC(y,z) means z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, so z must at least come close to x's boundary. It can't be completely in the interior of x without touching its boundary.

Case 6: Could x be a part of z (TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z))? No, because y is inside x, and z is externally connected to y. If x were inside z, then y would have to be inside z too, which would contradict EC(y,z).

Case 7: Could x and z be equal (EQ)? No, because y is a proper part of x, and z is externally connected to y. If x and z were equal, z would contain y, contradicting EC(y,z).

Let me double-check these analyses.

For DC(x,z): Since y touches the boundary of x and z touches y, it seems implausible that x and z could be completely disconnected. If y is at the boundary of x, and z touches y, then z must at least touch x's boundary or overlap with x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z): This is possible. If y touches x's boundary at some point, and z touches y's boundary at the same point, then x and z could touch at that point without overlapping.

For PO(x,z): This is possible. If z extends into x beyond the boundary point where y touches x, then x and z would partially overlap.

For TPP(z,x): This is possible. z could be entirely inside x and touch x's boundary, while also touching y.

For TPP(x,z): This is not possible. Since y is a proper part of x and y is externally connected to z, x cannot be a proper part of z.

For NTPP(z,x): This is not possible because EC(y,z) means z touches y's boundary, and TPPi(x,y) means y touches x's boundary, so z must come at least close to x's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z): This is not possible for the same reason that TPP(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z): This is not possible. If x and z were equal, then z would contain y, contradicting EC(y,z).

Let me carefully reconsider the case of DC(x,z). 

TPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

If z touches y at y's boundary, and part of y's boundary is also x's boundary, then z might touch x at that point, making EC(x,z) true.

However, it's also possible that z touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x. In that case, z would not touch x's boundary, and if z extends outside of x, we would have PO(x,z). If z is completely inside x, we would have TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x).

Actually, there's another case: what if z touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x, but z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary? This would make NTPP(z,x) true.

Let me reconsider the case of DC(x,z). If z touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z is entirely outside of x, then we would have DC(x,z). But this is geometrically impossible in a standard topological space, because it would require z to be both connected to y (which is inside x) and completely outside of x, which violates the connectedness of z.

Actually, wait. Let's think about this more carefully. If we have a "standard" space like the 2D plane, then the boundary of a connected region is connected (specifically, it's a simple closed curve, by the Jordan curve theorem). So if y is a tangential proper part of x, then y's boundary intersects x's boundary in a connected component (like an arc).

Now, if z is externally connected to y, it means z touches y's boundary but doesn't overlap with y. This touching could happen at any point on y's boundary, including points that are on x's boundary and points that are in the interior of x.

If z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary, then z would also touch x, making EC(x,z) true.

If z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z extends outside of x, then z would partially overlap with x, making PO(x,z) true.

If z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z is completely inside x, then z would be a proper part of x. If z touches x's boundary, we would have TPP(z,x), and if z doesn't touch x's boundary, we would have NTPP(z,x).

So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

I want to double-check the possibility of NTPP(z,x) because I think I might be making a mistake.

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
If EC(y,z), then y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now, is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x?

For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. But z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary. 

Actually, y touches x's boundary, but that doesn't mean every point on y's boundary is also on x's boundary. Some parts of y's boundary might be in the interior of x. If z touches y at such a part and is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then NTPP(z,x) would be true.

So NTPP(z,x) is indeed a possibility.

Let me double-check for any other possibilities I might have missed.

TPP(x,z)? No, because y is a proper part of x and y is externally connected to z, so x cannot be a proper part of z.

NTPPi(x,z)? No, for the same reason.

TPPi(x,z)? No, for the same reason.

DC(x,z)? No, because if y touches the boundary of x and z touches y, it's not possible for x and z to be completely disconnected.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Wait, let me re-examine the case of DC(x,z) more carefully. 

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

We need to remember that these regions can have arbitrary shapes, not just simple ones like circles or rectangles. For example, x could be a U-shaped region, and y could be a smaller U-shaped region that touches the outer boundary of x at the open end of the U. Then, z could touch y at the inner part of the U, without touching or overlapping with x at all.

Actually, that doesn't seem right. If y is a tangential proper part of x, and z touches y's boundary, then z must either touch x's boundary (if z touches y at a point where y touches x), or z must be partly or wholly inside x (if z touches y at a point where y's boundary is in the interior of x). In either case, z cannot be completely disconnected from x.

So I believe DC(x,z) is not a possibility.

Let me reconsider the configurations one more time:

1. EC(x,z): z touches x at the boundary, but they don't share interior points. This can happen if z touches y at a point where y touches x's boundary.

2. PO(x,z): z partially overlaps with x. This can happen if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z extends outside of x.

3. TPP(z,x): z is a tangential proper part of x. This can happen if z is completely inside x, touches x's boundary, and also touches y.

4. NTPP(z,x): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This can happen if z is completely inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary, but touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

I don't see any other possibilities. So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I realize that I've been careless in some of my reasoning. Let me approach this more systematically.

Given:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

First, let me consider the case where z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary.

In this case, z would also touch x at that point. If z is completely outside of x except for this touching point, then EC(x,z) would be true.

Now, let me consider the case where z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

In this case, z must overlap with x, at least at the point where z touches y. But since regions are supposed to be regular closed sets (i.e., they are equal to the closure of their interior), a single point overlap would make z and x disconnected, not externally connected or partially overlapping. So z must overlap with x in a non-trivial way.

If z is completely inside x, then z would be a proper part of x. If z touches x's boundary, we would have TPP(z,x), and if z doesn't touch x's boundary, we would have NTPP(z,x).

If z is partly inside x and partly outside x, then we would have PO(x,z).

It occurs to me that we have to be careful about the definitions of "inside", "outside", "interior", "boundary", etc. in the context of RCC-8. Let me try to be more precise.

In RCC-8, regions are non-empty regular closed sets in a topological space. The boundary of a region is the set of points that are in the closure of the region and the closure of its complement. The interior of a region is the set of points that are in the region but not on its boundary.

With these definitions, let me reconsider the problem.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means:
1. All points in y are also in x.
2. Not all points in x are in y.
3. Some points in y are on the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means:
1. No points in the interior of y are in z.
2. No points in the interior of z are in y.
3. Some points on the boundary of y are on the boundary of z.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

DC(x,z) means x and z share no points. But since y is in x and z touches y, z must also touch or overlap with x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z) means x and z share boundary points but no interior points. This is possible if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary, and z doesn't overlap with x.

PO(x,z) means x and z share some interior points, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z extends outside of x.

TPP(z,x) means z is a proper subset of x and shares at least one boundary point with x. This is possible if z is completely inside x, touches x's boundary, and also touches y.

NTPP(z,x) means z is a proper subset of x and shares no boundary points with x. This is possible if z is completely inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary, but touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) would mean that x is a subset of z. But since y is in x and y is externally connected to z, x cannot be a subset of z. So TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me be super careful with my reasoning regarding the relative position of where z touches y in relation to x.

Given TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x:
- y is wholly inside x.
- Some part of y's boundary touches x's boundary.
- But not all of y's boundary coincides with x's boundary. Parts of y's boundary are in the interior of x.

Given EC(y,z), which means y and z are externally connected:
- y and z share some boundary points.
- But they don't share any interior points.

Let's consider different scenarios based on where z touches y:

1. z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary:
   In this case, z also touches x at that point. If z doesn't overlap with x, we have EC(x,z).

2. z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x:
   In this case, z must overlap with a part of x. If z is completely inside x, we have TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x), depending on whether z touches x's boundary or not. If z is partly inside and partly outside x, we have PO(x,z).

Actually, there's a subtle case I missed. What if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, but z is completely outside of x except for that one point? This would make z and x externally connected, so EC(x,z).

But wait, this doesn't make sense geometrically. If z touches y at a point that is in the interior of x, then there are points of z that are in the interior of x. z can't be "completely outside of x except for that one point" and still touch y at a point in the interior of x.

So the scenarios are:

1. z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary. In this case, we have EC(x,z) if z doesn't overlap with x.

2. z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x. In this case, we have PO(x,z) if z is partly inside and partly outside x, TPP(z,x) if z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, or NTPP(z,x) if z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually wait, let me double-check this logic again. I'm not 100% confident about the EC(x,z) case. I believe it's possible, but let me reason through it once more.

Given TPPi(x,y), y is tangentially and properly within x. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries.

If z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, then z could also touch the boundary of x at that same point, making EC(x,z) possible.

But there's another, more subtle case: z could touch y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x. In this case, z would have to overlap with the interior of x, at least at that point. 

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. The RCC-8 relations are defined for "regions", and a region is typically understood as a non-empty regular closed set in some topological space. A regular closed set is one that is equal to the closure of its interior. This ensures that regions can't have "thin" parts like single points or lines.

So if z touches y at a point in the interior of x, then z must overlap with x in a non-trivial way. It can't just touch x at a single point.

Given this understanding, let me reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. EC(x,z): This is possible if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary, and z doesn't overlap with the interior of x.

2. PO(x,z): This is possible if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z extends outside of x.

3. TPP(z,x): This is possible if z is completely inside x, touches x's boundary, and also touches y.

4. NTPP(z,x): This is possible if z is completely inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary, but touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

DC(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible for the reasons I discussed earlier.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me double-check the TPP(z,x) case one more time.

For TPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Also, since EC(y,z), z must touch y's boundary. The question is: can z touch both y's boundary and x's boundary?

Given TPPi(x,y), y touches x's boundary. If z touches y at a point where y touches x's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary at that point. And if z is completely inside x, we would have TPP(z,x).

So TPP(z,x) is indeed a possibility.

Actually, let me reconsider all of the cases one more time. I want to make sure I've considered all the configurations correctly.

Given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), let's think about the possible configurations:

1. z could touch y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary. In this case, z would also touch x's boundary at that point. If z is completely outside of x except for this touching point, we would have EC(x,z).

2. z could touch y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x. In this case, z would overlap with x, at least at that point. If z extends outside of x, we would have PO(x,z).

3. z could be completely inside x. If z touches y at a point on y's boundary, then:
   a. If this point is also on x's boundary, and z touches x's boundary, we would have TPP(z,x).
   b. If this point is in the interior of x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary, we would have NTPP(z,x).

I don't see any other possibilities. So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, I think I've been overthinking the NTPP(z,x) case. Let me reconsider.

For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. Also, since EC(y,z), z must touch y's boundary. 

Given TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and touches x's boundary. If z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, then we would have NTPP(z,x).

So NTPP(z,x) is indeed a possibility.

Let me be super systematic and go through each of the 8 RCC relations, and reason whether it's possible or not as a relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since y is part of x and z touches y, z must also touch or overlap with x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary, and z doesn't overlap with the interior of x.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is possible if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z extends outside of x.

4. TPP(z,x): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x, touches x's boundary, and also touches y.

5. NTPP(z,x): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is completely inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary, but touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z. But since y is part of x and y is externally connected to z, x cannot be a proper part of z. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Again, since y is part of x and y is externally connected to z, x cannot be a proper part of z. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. But since y is a proper part of x and y is externally connected to z, x and z cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me just think of a simple physical configuration corresponding to each of these possibilities to double-check:

1. EC(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x at one point. Now, z could be a circle outside of x that touches x and y at the same point.

2. PO(x,z): Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x at one point. Now, z could be a circle that touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z extends outside of x.

3. TPP(z,x): Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x at one point. Now, z could be a small circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at one point, and also touching y.

4. NTPP(z,x): Imagine x as a large circle, y as a smaller circle inside x and touching the boundary of x at one point. Now, z could be a small circle completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x, but touching y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

All of these configurations seem plausible, so I believe EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x) are indeed the possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, a big realization: I'm being careless with the NTPP(z,x) and TPP(z,x) cases, specifically in how z touches y.

For TPP(z,x), z is inside x and touches x's boundary. For NTPP(z,x), z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. 

But in both cases, since EC(y,z), z must touch y's boundary. Given TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and touches x's boundary. 

For TPP(z,x), can z touch y in a way that satisfies EC(y,z)? Yes, z could touch y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

For NTPP(z,x), can z touch y in a way that satisfies EC(y,z)? Yes, z could touch y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z doesn't touch x's boundary.

So both TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) are indeed possible relationships between x and z.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let's be a bit more thorough. When I'm verifying the NTPP(z,x) case, I need to be sure that EC(y,z) is satisfied. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, can z touch y in a way that satisfies EC(y,z)?

Let's imagine y as a circle inside x and touching the boundary of x at one point. If z is a circle inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x, can z touch y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x?

Yes, this is possible. Imagine y as a circle inside x and touching the boundary of x at one point. There are many points on y's boundary that are in the interior of x. z could be a small circle inside x that touches y at one of these points, but doesn't touch the boundary of x.

So NTPP(z,x) is indeed a possible relationship between x and z.

Actually, I'm going to check the PO(x,z) case one more time. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, can z extend outside of x to form a partial overlap with x?

Yes, this is possible. Imagine y as a circle inside x and touching the boundary of x at one point. There are many points on y's boundary that are in the interior of x. z could be a circle that touches y at one of these points, and extends partly outside of x.

So PO(x,z) is indeed a possible relationship between x and z.

And with that, I will reaffirm that the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me double-check the EC(x,z) case one more time, since this is the only case where we have z touching y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary. 

Given TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given EC(y,z), z touches y's boundary. 

If z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary at that point. If z is completely outside of x except for this touching point, we would have EC(x,z).

OK, I think this is well reasoned. Let me go back over my reasoning once more.

1. DC(x,z): This is not possible. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y, then z must also touch or overlap with x. It can't be disconnected from x.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary, and z is completely outside of x except for this touching point.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z extends outside of x.

4. TPP(z,x): This is possible if z is completely inside x, touches x's boundary, and also touches y.

5. NTPP(z,x): This is possible if z is completely inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary, but touches y at a part of y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is not possible. If y is inside x and y touches z, then x cannot be inside z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi(x,z).

8. EQ(x,z): This is not possible. If y is a proper part of x and y touches z, then x and z cannot be the same region.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, let me double-check the TPP(z,x) case one more time. For TPP(z,x) to be true, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Also, since EC(y,z), z must touch y's boundary. 

Given TPPi(x,y), y is inside x and touches x's boundary. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, can z touch y in a way that satisfies EC(y,z)?

Yes, z could touch y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x. So TPP(z,x) is indeed a possible relationship between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Oh wait, I think I'm being careless in the TPP(z,x) case. 

For TPP(z,x), z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. For EC(y,z), z must touch y's boundary but not overlap with y. But how can z touch both y's boundary and x's boundary without passing through y? I think there's a problem here.

Actually, it is possible. Let me draw it out. Imagine:
- x is a large square
- y is a small square inside x, with one corner touching the boundary of x
- z is a small square inside x, with one corner touching the boundary of x (but at a different point from where y touches x), and another corner touching the boundary of y

This would make z a tangential proper part of x, and z would be externally connected to y. So TPP(z,x) is a possible relationship between x and z.

OK, so the relationships between x and z that are possible, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

Actually, just to be complete, let me try to put together a simple geometry where each of these 4 relationships could be realized:

1. EC(x,z): Imagine x is a square region, y is a smaller square inside x with one corner touching the boundary of x, and z is a square outside of x that touches x at the same corner where y touches x.

2. PO(x,z): Imagine x is a square region, y is a smaller square inside x with one corner touching the boundary of x, and z is a square that touches y at some point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z extends outside of x.

3. TPP(z,x): Imagine x is a square region, y is a smaller square inside x with one corner touching the boundary of x, and z is a smaller square inside x, with one corner touching the boundary of x (but at a different point from where y touches x), and another corner touching the boundary of y.

4. NTPP(z,x): Imagine x is a square region, y is a smaller square inside x with one corner touching the boundary of x, and z is a small square completely inside x, not touching the boundary of x, but touching y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

All of these configurations seem plausible, so I believe EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x) are indeed the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Actually, on second thought, in the TPP(z,x) case I'm verifying that EC(y,z) is satisfied, but I haven't fully convinced myself that it's possible for z to touch both y's boundary and x's boundary without overlapping with y.

Let me think. If TPPi(x,y), then y is inside x and touches x's boundary. If TPP(z,x), then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Now, for EC(y,z), z must touch y's boundary but not overlap with y.

Can z touch both y's boundary and x's boundary without overlapping with y? Yes, z could be a region inside x that touches x's boundary at one point and touches y's boundary at another point, without overlapping with y.

So TPP(z,x) is indeed a possible relationship between x and z.

Actually, in our TPP(z,x) case, let me be extra careful about not just EC(y,z) (external connection) but also TPP(z,x) itself.

For TPP(z,x), z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning:
1. Every point in z is also in x.
2. Not every point in x is in z.
3. Some points in z are on the boundary of x.

Also, since EC(y,z), y and z must be externally connected, meaning:
1. No points in the interior of y are in z.
2. No points in the interior of z are in y.
3. Some points on the boundary of y are on the boundary of z.

Given TPPi(x,y), which is the same as TPP(y,x), y is a tangential proper part of x, meaning:
1. Every point in y is also in x.
2. Not every point in x is in y.
3. Some points in y are on the boundary of x.

Is it possible for all of these conditions to be met? Let's check.

For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. For y to be a tangential proper part of x, y must also be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. For y and z to be externally connected, they must touch at their boundaries but not overlap.

So the question is: can two regions inside a third region both touch the boundary of the third region and also touch each other, without overlapping?

Yes, this is possible. Imagine x as a square, y as a smaller square inside x with one corner touching the boundary of x, and z as another smaller square inside x with one corner touching the boundary of x (at a different point from where y touches x), and another corner touching the boundary of y. This would make both y and z tangential proper parts of x, and y and z would be externally connected.

So TPP(z,x) is indeed a possible relationship between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me do a final check of my work:

Given:
- TPPi(x,y), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z), which means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

The possible relationships between x and z are:

1. EC(x,z): This is possible if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is also on x's boundary, and z is completely outside of x except for this touching point.

2. PO(x,z): This is possible if z touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, and z extends outside of x.

3. TPP(z,x): This is possible if z is completely inside x, touches x's boundary, and also touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

4. NTPP(z,x): This is possible if z is completely inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary, but touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x.

DC(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are not possible, as I've argued previously.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(z,x), and NTPP(z,x).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to consider what relationships are possible between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x and touches x's boundary.
- EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected - they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.

Now I'll systematically determine what relationships are possible between x and z:

1. EC(x,z): Possible. If z touches y at a point where y touches x's boundary, then z could touch x at that same point without overlapping with x's interior.

2. PO(x,z): Possible. If z touches y at a point on y's boundary that's in the interior of x, and z extends outside of x, then z partially overlaps with x.

3. TPP(z,x): Possible. If z is completely inside x, touches x's boundary, and also touches y's boundary at some point, then z is a tangential proper part of x.

4. NTPP(z,x): Possible. If z is completely inside x, doesn't touch x's boundary, but touches y at a point on y's boundary that is in the interior of x, then z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

The other relations (DC, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ) are not possible because they would contradict the given relations.
