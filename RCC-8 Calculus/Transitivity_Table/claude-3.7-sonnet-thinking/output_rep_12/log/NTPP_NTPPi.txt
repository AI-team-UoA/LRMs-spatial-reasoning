PROMPT: If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Alright, so we have NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z). Let me first make sure I understand what these mean:

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. In other words, x is a proper part of y, and it's completely inside y, away from the boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means that z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

So, what do these two together tell us about the relationship between x and z?

NTPP(x,y) tells us that x is completely inside y, away from the boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) tells us that y is completely inside z, away from the boundary.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relationships between x and z in terms of the RCC-8 relations?

Since x is completely inside y and y is completely inside z, it would seem that x is also completely inside z. But the question is: does x touch the boundary of z or not?

Given that x is away from the boundary of y, and y is away from the boundary of z, it would seem that x is also away from the boundary of z. This would suggest NTPP(x,z) as a relationship. But let's think if there are other possibilities.

DC(x,z) is not possible because x and z must share spatial parts (since x is part of y, which is part of z).
EC(x,z) is not possible because x is inside y, which is inside z, so x and z don't just touch at a boundary.
PO(x,z) is not possible because x is completely inside z, not just overlapping.
TPP(x,z) is not possible because x is away from the boundary of z, as discussed above.
TPPi(x,z) is not possible because x is inside z, not the other way around.
NTPPi(x,z) is not possible because x is inside z, not the other way around.
EQ(x,z) is not possible because x is inside both y and z, while y is inside z, so x and z can't be coincident.

So, it seems that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double check by thinking about this more systematically.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means that x is contained in the interior of y.
NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means that z is contained in the interior of y.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. If z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, then z cannot be a proper part of y. Let's try again.

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

So we have x is a non-tangential proper part of y, and y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would suggest that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(x,z).

Let's see if any other relations are possible:

DC(x,z) would mean that x and z are disconnected. But x is part of y, which is part of z, so x and z must be connected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z) would mean that x and z are externally connected, i.e., they share a boundary but no interior. But x is part of y, which is part of z, so x is part of z and they share interior. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z) would mean that x and z partially overlap, each having parts that the other doesn't. But x is part of y, which is part of z, so x is entirely contained in z. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z) would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is part of z and touches the boundary of z. But x is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning it doesn't touch the boundary of y. And y is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning it doesn't touch the boundary of z. So x is separated from the boundary of z by the buffer between y and the boundary of z. Hence, x doesn't touch the boundary of z, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is part of z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. As discussed above, x is part of y, which is part of z, and due to the buffer between y and the boundary of z, x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is part of x and touches the boundary of x. But we know that y is part of z, and x is part of y. So z contains y, which contains x. This contradicts the idea that z is part of x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is part of x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. As with TPPi(x,z), this contradicts the given information, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) would mean that x and z are equal. But x is part of y, which is part of z, so x and z are not equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Hang on, let me think about this a bit more carefully. I think I made an error, because I haven't been considering the specific definitions of these relations carefully enough.

Let's go back to the definitions:

- NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means that x is completely inside y and does not touch the boundary of y.
- NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., y is completely inside z and does not touch the boundary of z.

So, the situation is that x is completely inside y, away from the boundary, and y is completely inside z, away from the boundary.

Now, let's systematically check each RCC-8 relation to see if it could hold between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This relation means x and z are disconnected. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is inside z and they are connected. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This relation means x and z are externally connected, i.e., they touch only at the boundary. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is inside z and not just touching at the boundary. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This relation means x and z partially overlap, with each having parts that the other doesn't. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z, x is completely inside z, not just partially overlapping. So, PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): This relation means x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. Since x is inside y, and y is inside z without touching the boundary of z, x is separated from the boundary of z by the buffer between y and the boundary of z. Hence, x doesn't touch the boundary of z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): This relation means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. As discussed, x is inside y, which is inside z away from the boundary, so x is inside z away from the boundary. So, NTPP(x,z) is possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This relation means z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But we know that y is inside z, and x is inside y. So z contains y, which contains x. This contradicts the idea that z is inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This relation means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. As with TPPi(x,z), this contradicts the given information, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This relation means x and z are equal, sharing the same spatial extent. But x is inside y, which is inside z, so x and z are not equal. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after checking all the RCC-8 relations, I've concluded that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So my final answer is that if NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

Wait, there is something wrong with my reasoning above. Let me reconsider a case:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Now, I want to consider whether PO(x,z) is possible. For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z would have to share a spatial part, but neither would be a part of the other. However, we know that x is a part of y, and y is a part of z. By transitivity, x is a part of z. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

So, NTPP(x,z) still seems to be the only possible relationship.

Let me triple check again:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means that x is completely inside y and does not touch the boundary of y.
NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means that y is completely inside z and does not touch the boundary of z.

DC(x,z) would mean that x and z are disconnected. But since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is inside z, so they are connected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z) would mean that x and z are externally connected, touching only at the boundary. But since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is inside z, not just touching at the boundary. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

PO(x,z) would mean that x and z partially overlap, each having parts that the other doesn't. But since x is inside y and y is inside z, x is completely inside z, not just partially overlapping. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z) would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and touches the boundary of z. But since x is inside y without touching the boundary of y, and y is inside z without touching the boundary of z, x is separated from the boundary of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. As discussed, x is inside y, which is inside z away from the boundary, so x is inside z away from the boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But we know that y is inside z, and x is inside y. So z contains y, which contains x. This contradicts the idea that z is inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. As with TPPi(x,z), this contradicts the given information, so NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) would mean that x and z are equal. But since x is inside y, which is inside z, x and z are not equal. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, after checking all the RCC-8 relations, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait a second. I've been conflating NTPP and NTPPi. Let me just make sure I'm applying the right definitions:

NTPP(x,y) means that x is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means that x is fully inside y and does not touch the boundary of y.
NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So, y is fully inside z and does not touch the boundary of z.

With these definitions, I've systematically gone through each RCC-8 relation and concluded that the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

I think I need to be a bit more careful with transitivity and remember that these are binary relations.

NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y, so x is contained in the interior of y.
NTPPi(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z, so y is contained in the interior of z.

If x is contained in the interior of y, and y is contained in the interior of z, then x is contained in the interior of z. This corresponds to NTPP(x,z).

If I had to summarize this transitivity: NTPP ∘ NTPPi = NTPP, where ∘ denotes relation composition.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(x,z).

So, the answer is:

If NTPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationship holds between x and z given the two specified relations.

First, let's understand what we know:
- NTPP(x,y) means x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which is equivalent to saying y is a non-tangential proper part of z

So we have:
- x is completely inside y, away from y's boundary
- y is completely inside z, away from z's boundary

Let me check each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible since x is inside z (via y)
2. EC(x,z): Not possible since x cannot touch z's boundary (it's separated by the buffer between y and z's boundary)
3. PO(x,z): Not possible since x is completely contained in z
4. TPP(x,z): Not possible since x cannot touch z's boundary
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible since x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible since z contains x, not vice versa
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible since z contains x, not vice versa
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible since x is properly contained in z

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
