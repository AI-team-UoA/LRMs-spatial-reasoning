PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the given statements to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, we have TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). This tells us that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is a proper part of x (y is fully contained in x), and y touches the boundary of x.

Second, we have TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y). This tells us that z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is a proper part of y (z is fully contained in y), and z touches the boundary of y.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

From TPP(y,x), we know that y is fully contained in x. 
From TPP(z,y), we know that z is fully contained in y.

By transitivity of the part-of relation, if z is fully contained in y and y is fully contained in x, then z is fully contained in x. This means that z is either a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)).

Let's consider these possibilities:

1. If z touches the boundary of y and y touches the boundary of x, then z might also touch the boundary of x. In this case, we would have TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

2. Alternatively, z might not touch the boundary of x, even though it touches the boundary of y. This could happen if the part of the boundary of y that z touches is not also part of the boundary of x. In this case, we would have NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning.

Actually, I think I was partially incorrect above. Let me try again with a clearer understanding.

We have TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x). This means that y is a proper part of x, and y touches the boundary of x.

We also have TPPi(y,z), which means TPP(z,y). This means that z is a proper part of y, and z touches the boundary of y.

From these, we know:
- y is a proper part of x
- z is a proper part of y

By transitivity, z is a proper part of x. However, the tangentiality (whether z touches the boundary of x) is not immediately clear. Let's analyze this more carefully.

Let's consider the possibilities for the relationship between z and x:

1. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z)). This would be the case if z touches the boundary of x.

2. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z)). This would be the case if z does not touch the boundary of x.

Could z be exactly equal to x (EQ(z,x))? No, because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, which means z is strictly smaller than x.

Could z partially overlap with x (PO(z,x))? No, because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, which means z is fully contained in x.

Could z be externally connected to x (EC(z,x))? No, because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, which means z is fully contained in x and not just touching the boundary.

Could z be disconnected from x (DC(z,x))? No, for the same reason as above.

Is it possible for z to be a TPP of x? Yes, if z touches the boundary of x. This can happen if the part of the boundary of y that z touches is also part of the boundary of x.

Is it possible for z to be an NTPP of x? Yes, if z does not touch the boundary of x. This can happen if the part of the boundary of y that z touches is inside x and not part of the boundary of x.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are TPP(z,x) (or equivalently TPPi(x,z)) and NTPP(z,x) (or equivalently NTPPi(x,z)).

But I should formulate the final answer in terms of the relationship from x to z, not from z to x.

So the possible relationships are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me try once more. I think I made another error.

We have TPPi(x,y), which means that TPP(y,x). This means that y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.

We also have TPPi(y,z), which means that TPP(z,y). This means that z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

By transitivity, z is a proper part of x. But whether z touches the boundary of x or not isn't immediately clear.

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y also touches the boundary of x, then z will also touch the boundary of x, making z a TPP of x.

But if z touches the boundary of y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x (i.e., the point is inside x), then z will not touch the boundary of x, making z an NTPP of x.

So, the possible relationships from z to x are TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x).

Since the question asks for the relationship from x to z, the possible relationships are:
- TPPi(x,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,x))
- NTPPi(x,z) (which is the same as NTPP(z,x))

Actually, we need to be careful here. Let me also check if any other RCC-8 relations can hold between x and z.

If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then y is a tangential proper part of x, and z is a tangential proper part of y. This means that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and z is inside y and touches the boundary of y.

Claim: The possible relations from x to z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I've already argued for why these are possible. Are there any other possibilities?

Could EQ(x,z) be possible? No, because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, which means z is strictly smaller than x.

Could PO(x,z) be possible? No, because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, which means z is fully contained in x. For PO to hold, there would need to be a part of z that is outside of x, but this is not possible given our constraints.

Could EC(x,z) be possible? No, because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, which means z is fully contained in x. For EC to hold, x and z would need to touch only at the boundary, but since z is fully contained in x, they share interior points.

Could DC(x,z) be possible? No, because z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, which means z is fully contained in x. For DC to hold, x and z would need to be completely disconnected, but since z is fully contained in x, they are connected.

Could TPP(x,z) be possible? We know that z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x. For TPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be a tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts our knowledge that z is a proper part of x.

Could NTPP(x,z) be possible? Similar to the above, for NTPP(x,z) to hold, x would need to be a non-tangential proper part of z. But this contradicts our knowledge that z is a proper part of x.

So, the only possible relations from x to z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

But actually, I should think about this more carefully with another check. Could EQ(x,z) be possible?

We know that:
- TPPi(x,y) means that y is a proper part of x and y touches the boundary of x.
- TPPi(y,z) means that z is a proper part of y and z touches the boundary of y.

For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z would need to be identical. But since z is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of x, we know that z is smaller than y, which is smaller than x. So z cannot be equal to x.

Hmm, but this reasoning assumes transitivity of the "proper part" relation. I believe this is a valid assumption in the context of RCC-8, but let me check.

In the RCC-8 calculus, the "proper part" relation (PP) is indeed transitive. If A is a proper part of B and B is a proper part of C, then A is a proper part of C.

Now, TPP and NTPP are specific types of the PP relation, where TPP(A,B) means A is a tangential proper part of B, and NTPP(A,B) means A is a non-tangential proper part of B.

So, if TPP(y,x) and TPP(z,y), then PP(y,x) and PP(z,y), which implies PP(z,x). This means that z is a proper part of x, but it doesn't tell us whether z is a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x.

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y also touches the boundary of x, then z will also touch the boundary of x, making z a TPP of x. This is very geometrically intuitive.

But if z touches the boundary of y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x (i.e., the point is inside x), then z will not touch the boundary of x, making z an NTPP of x. This is also geometrically intuitive.

So, given TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), the possible relationships from x to z are:
- TPPi(x,z) (which is the same as TPP(z,x))
- NTPPi(x,z) (which is the same as NTPP(z,x))

Actually, let me check if TPP is transitive. We know that TPP is a specific type of PP, and PP is transitive. But is TPP itself transitive?

Not necessarily. If A is a tangential proper part of B and B is a tangential proper part of C, A might still be a non-tangential proper part of C. This could happen if A touches the boundary of B at a point where B does not touch the boundary of C.

But the transitivity of PP ensures that if TPP(y,x) and TPP(z,y), then either TPP(z,x) or NTPP(z,x). So the possible relations from x to z are indeed TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Just to make sure this is correct, let me create a concrete example. I want to create a scenario where TPPi(x,y), TPPi(y,z), and the relation from x to z is either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z).

Example 1 (where the relation from x to z is TPPi(x,z)):
- Let x be a solid square.
- Let y be a smaller solid square entirely inside x, but with one corner touching the boundary of x.
- Let z be an even smaller solid square entirely inside y, positioned such that one corner of z touches the boundary of y at the same corner where y touches the boundary of x.

In this example:
- TPPi(x,y) is true because y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z) is true because z is a tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(x,z) is true because z is a tangential proper part of x (since z touches the boundary of x at the point where it also touches the boundary of y).

Example 2 (where the relation from x to z is NTPPi(x,z)):
- Let x be a solid square.
- Let y be a smaller solid square entirely inside x, but with one corner touching the boundary of x.
- Let z be an even smaller solid square entirely inside y, positioned such that one corner of z touches the boundary of y, but at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x (i.e., the point is inside x).

In this example:
- TPPi(x,y) is true because y is a tangential proper part of x.
- TPPi(y,z) is true because z is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(x,z) is true because z is a non-tangential proper part of x (since z does not touch the boundary of x, even though it touches the boundary of y).

So, based on these examples, the possible relations from x to z are indeed TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

So for the answer: if TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z), then the possible relationships between x and z are TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me actually reason through this more carefully one more time.

We are given:
1. TPPi(x,y) - This means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is fully inside x and touches the boundary of x.
2. TPPi(y,z) - This means that z is a tangential proper part of y, i.e., z is fully inside y and touches the boundary of y.

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

From the above, we know that z is fully inside y, and y is fully inside x. By transitivity, z is fully inside x. But is z a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x?

If z touches the boundary of y at a point where y also touches the boundary of x, then z will also touch the boundary of x. In this case, z is a tangential proper part of x, or equivalently, x is an inverse tangential proper part of z: TPPi(x,z).

However, if z touches the boundary of y at a point where y does not touch the boundary of x (i.e., a point inside x), then z will not touch the boundary of x. In this case, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, or equivalently, x is an inverse non-tangential proper part of z: NTPPi(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

OK so the answer is TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how regions x and z relate spatially given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let's understand what we know:
- TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x (y is fully inside x and touches x's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y): z is a tangential proper part of y (z is fully inside y and touches y's boundary)

By transitivity of the proper part relation, since z is inside y and y is inside x, z must be inside x. However, whether z touches the boundary of x depends on specific geometric configurations:

1. If z touches y's boundary at a point where y also touches x's boundary, then z will also touch x's boundary. This gives us TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

2. If z touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch x's boundary, then z won't touch x's boundary. This gives us NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

No other RCC-8 relations are possible given the constraints.
