PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem by examining the constraints from the given relations and figuring out what relationships are possible between x and z.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap, sharing some spatial part, but neither is contained in the other

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z, which could be any of: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, or EQ.

Let's go through each possible relation systematically:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   This means x and z share no parts. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary, and y overlaps with z, but the overlap portion of y and z doesn't reach the boundary where x touches y.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible if the boundary where x touches y is also part of z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   This means x and z share some part, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if x extends into z beyond just touching at a boundary.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   This means x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. For this to be true, x would need to be entirely contained in z but touch z's boundary. Given that x is externally connected to y, and y partially overlaps with z, this could be possible if y contains a portion of z and x is within that portion.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   This means x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This seems challenging given that x touches y's boundary, and y only partially overlaps with z. It would require x to be completely inside the overlapping region of y and z, without touching any boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that y partially overlaps with z (so z isn't fully contained in y), and x only touches y at the boundary, it seems unlikely that z could be fully contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   This means z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This seems even more unlikely than TPPi given the constraints.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   This means x and z are the same region. Given that x is only externally connected to y, but z partially overlaps with y, x and z cannot be equal.

Let's now think about which of these are definitely possible, definitely impossible, and which need more analysis.

Definitely possible:
- DC(x,z): x can touch y at a boundary, and y can overlap with z in a region that doesn't include the boundary where x touches.
- EC(x,z): x can touch y at a boundary, and z can extend to include that same boundary.
- PO(x,z): x can extend beyond the boundary it shares with y and overlap with z.

Definitely impossible (based on the above reasoning):
- EQ(x,z): Contradicts the given relations.
- NTPPi(x,z): If z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary, it can't partially overlap with y while x only touches y at the boundary.

Need more analysis:
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)

Let's analyze these cases more carefully:

TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be fully contained in z and touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. For x to be fully inside z, z would need to include both x and the part of y that x touches. This is possible if z overlaps with y in a way that includes the boundary where x touches y, and z also fully contains x.

NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x must be fully contained in z without touching z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. For x to be fully inside z without touching z's boundary, z would need to contain both x and a "buffer" around x that includes the boundary where x touches y. This seems possible if z overlaps with y in a way that includes not just the boundary where x touches y, but also some surrounding area.

TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z must be fully contained in x and touch x's boundary. Given PO(y,z), z is not fully contained in y. Since x only touches y at a boundary (EC(x,y)), it's hard to see how z could be fully contained in x unless z is also very small and happens to be exactly at the boundary where x and y touch. This seems like a very specific case, and I'm not sure if it's generally possible given just the constraints EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

After further thought, I'm leaning towards TPPi(x,z) being impossible as a general case. If z is fully contained in x, and z partially overlaps with y, then x must also overlap with y, which contradicts EC(x,y).

I need to refine my thinking for NTPP(x,z) as well. For x to be non-tangentially inside z, given that x touches y's boundary, z would need to contain both x and part of y that includes the boundary where x touches. But this would mean that z overlaps with y beyond just a boundary, which is consistent with PO(y,z).

For TPP(x,z), a similar reasoning applies. x can be tangentially inside z if z contains both x and the part of y that x touches.

Let me reconsider the constraints and think about this more systematically.

EC(x,y) means:
- x and y share some boundary points
- x and y don't share any interior points

PO(y,z) means:
- y and z share some interior points
- Neither y nor z is fully contained in the other

Given these, let's consider each possible relation between x and z again:

DC(x,z): x and z share no points.
This is clearly possible if the part of y that overlaps with z doesn't include the boundary where x touches y.

EC(x,z): x and z share some boundary points but no interior points.
This is possible if z extends to the boundary where x touches y.

PO(x,z): x and z share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.
This is possible if x extends beyond just touching y at a boundary, and overlaps with z.

TPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary.
For this to be true, x would need to be fully inside z but touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. For x to be fully inside z, z would need to include the boundary where x touches y. This seems possible if z overlaps with y in a way that includes the boundary where x touches y, and z also fully contains x.

NTPP(x,z): x is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
For this to be true, x would need to be fully inside z without touching z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. For x to be fully inside z without touching z's boundary, z would need to contain both x and some "buffer" around x that includes the boundary where x touches y. This seems possible if z overlaps with y in a way that includes not just the boundary where x touches y, but also some surrounding area.

TPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary.
For this to be true, z would need to be fully contained in x but touch x's boundary. Given PO(y,z), z partially overlaps with y, which means z shares some interior points with y. Given EC(x,y), x only shares boundary points with y, not interior points. This means that if z shares interior points with y, those points cannot be part of x. Therefore, z cannot be fully contained in x, and TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

NTPPi(x,z): z is a proper part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
By similar reasoning as for TPPi, if z shares interior points with y, and x doesn't share any interior points with y, then z cannot be fully contained in x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region.
If x and z are the same region, then the relation between x and y would be the same as the relation between z and y. But EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are different relations, so x and z cannot be equal.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's double-check TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) once more to make sure these are truly possible.

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. For x to be fully inside z and touch z's boundary, z would need to include both x and the part of y's boundary that x touches. This is consistent with PO(y,z) because z can overlap with y in a way that includes the boundary where x touches, and z can also contain all of x.

For NTPP(x,z), x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. For x to be fully inside z without touching z's boundary, z would need to contain both x and a "buffer" around x that includes the boundary where x touches y. This is consistent with PO(y,z) because z can overlap with y in a way that includes the boundary where x touches and some surrounding area, and z can also contain all of x without x touching z's boundary.

So, after careful consideration, I believe the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Wait, let me review TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) one more time to be sure.

For TPP(x,z), x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. For x to be fully inside z and touch z's boundary, z would need to include the part of y's boundary that x touches. This is possible and consistent with PO(y,z).

For NTPP(x,z), x is fully inside z without touching z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y's boundary. For x to be fully inside z without touching z's boundary, z would need to include not just the boundary where x touches y, but also some surrounding area, creating a "buffer" between x and z's boundary. This is possible and consistent with PO(y,z).

So, my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me check a third time by visualizing this.

Imagine x is a circle and y is another circle, and they touch at a single point (EC(x,y)). Now, z is a third shape that partially overlaps with y (PO(y,z)).

DC(x,z): If z overlaps with y in an area that doesn't include the point where x touches y, then x and z are disconnected.

EC(x,z): If z overlaps with y in a way that includes the point where x touches y, then x and z can touch at that point.

PO(x,z): If z overlaps with y in a way that includes the point where x touches y, and z also extends into x's region, then x and z can partially overlap.

TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, z would need to fully contain x and also include the point where x touches y. This is possible if z is a large shape that encompasses both x and part of y.

NTPP(x,z): For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, z would need to fully contain x with a buffer, so x doesn't touch z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary, z would need to include the point where x touches y and create a buffer around it. This is possible if z is a very large shape that encompasses both x and a significant part of y.

TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be fully contained in x and touch x's boundary. But if z partially overlaps with y, and x only touches y at a boundary, how can z be fully contained in x? This seems impossible.

NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be fully contained in x without touching x's boundary. This is even more restrictive than TPPi, so it's also impossible.

EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then the relation between x and y would be the same as the relation between z and y. But EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) are different, so x and z cannot be equal.

So, after careful consideration, I believe the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

But let me just double check TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) one more time.

TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must be fully contained in z and touch z's boundary. Given EC(x,y), x touches y at some boundary point p. For x to be fully inside z, z must contain all of x. For x to touch z's boundary, there must be a point on x's boundary that's also on z's boundary. This is possible if z contains all of x except for the point p, which is on both x's and z's boundaries. 

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's break it down step by step:

For TPP(x,z): x is fully inside z and touches z's boundary.
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y at some boundary point.
- Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points.
- For x to be fully inside z, z must include all of x.
- For x to touch z's boundary, there must be at least one point on x's boundary that's also on z's boundary.

This is possible if z is a shape that contains all of x and extends into y, and there's a point on x's boundary that's also on z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z): x is fully inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y at some boundary point.
- Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points.
- For x to be fully inside z, z must include all of x.
- For x not to touch z's boundary, there must be a buffer between x and z's boundary.

This is possible if z is a shape that contains all of x with a buffer, and extends into y.

I think both TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are indeed possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I've been reasoning about this in an abstract way. Let me try a more concrete approach by drawing some examples on a piece of paper. This might help clarify the possibilities.

Imagine two regions:
- Region x is a circle.
- Region y is another circle that touches x at a single point p (EC(x,y)).
- Now, region z can be any shape that partially overlaps with y (PO(y,z)).

Let's consider different ways z can be positioned:

1. z overlaps with y, but doesn't reach the point p where x and y touch:
   - In this case, x and z don't share any points, so DC(x,z).

2. z overlaps with y and extends to include the point p:
   - In this case, x and z touch at the point p, so EC(x,z).

3. z overlaps with y, includes the point p, and also extends into x's region:
   - In this case, x and z share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other, so PO(x,z).

4. z is a very large region that contains all of x and also overlaps with y:
   - If there's a point on x's boundary that's also on z's boundary, then TPP(x,z).
   - If x is fully inside z with a buffer (i.e., no point on x's boundary is on z's boundary), then NTPP(x,z).

5. z is a small region contained within x that also overlaps with y:
   - Wait, this isn't possible. If z overlaps with y, and y only touches x at a boundary, then z cannot be fully contained in x. So, TPPi(x,z) is impossible.

6. z is a small region fully contained within x, away from x's boundary, and z also overlaps with y:
   - This is even less possible than scenario 5. So, NTPPi(x,z) is impossible.

7. z is identical to x:
   - Then z would have the same relation with y as x does, but PO(y,z) is different from EC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Based on these visualizations, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I made a mistake in visualizing option 5. It is indeed possible for TPPi(x,z) if x is a very large region and z is contained mostly in x, but extends slightly to overlap with y. Actually, let me careful examine the constraints again.

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is fully contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- Given EC(x,y), x touches y at some boundary point p.
- Given PO(y,z), y and z share some interior points.

For z to be fully contained in x, all points of z must be in x. For z to share interior points with y, at least one interior point of z must be in y. But since x and y only share boundary points (no interior points), any interior point of z that's in y cannot be in x. This contradicts the requirement that z is fully contained in x.

Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is indeed impossible.

By similar reasoning, NTPPi(x,z) is also impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

OK, I think I've checked these thoroughly enough now. My final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine all possible RCC-8 spatial relations between x and z, given that EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me analyze each potential relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   This is possible if z overlaps with a part of y away from where x touches y.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   This is possible if z includes the boundary point where x touches y.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   This is possible if z extends into x beyond just touching at a boundary.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   This is possible if z contains all of x and x touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   This is possible if z completely contains x with a buffer zone.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   This is impossible. Since z partially overlaps with y (shares interior points), and x only shares boundary points with y (not interior), z cannot be fully contained in x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   This is impossible for similar reasons as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   This is impossible because x and z would have the same relation to y, but EC(x,y) ≠ PO(y,z).

### Answer: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP
