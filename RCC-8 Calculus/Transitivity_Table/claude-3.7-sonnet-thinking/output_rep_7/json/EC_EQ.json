{"prompt": "If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given:\n- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (touch at boundaries but don't share interior)\n- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (spatially identical)\n\nSince y and z occupy exactly the same space (they are identical regions), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. \n\nSince x is externally connected to y, and z is identical to y, then x must also be externally connected to z.\n\n### Answer: EC(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 7.676770210266113, "reasoning-tokens": 445, "completion-tokens": 445}
