{"prompt": "If EQ(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?", "answer": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nWe know:\n- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)\n- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (they share some spatial part, but neither is contained in the other)\n\nSince EQ(x,y), x and y are identical in spatial terms. This means that x must have the same spatial relationship with z as y does with z.\n\nGiven that y has the relationship PO with z, and x is spatially identical to y, it follows that x must also have the relationship PO with z.\n\n### Answer: PO(x,z)", "elapsed-time": 27.436941146850586, "reasoning-tokens": 2223, "completion-tokens": 2223}
