PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think through this problem step-by-step.

I have:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary.
- TPP(y,z): This means that y is a tangential proper part of z. In other words, y is entirely contained within z and touches z's boundary.

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's visualize this:
- y is properly inside x (not touching x's boundary)
- y is properly inside z (touching z's boundary)

Now, what are the possible ways x and z could relate to each other?

1. Could x be disconnected from z (DC)? 
   If x is disconnected from z, then y cannot be part of both x and z. Since we know y is part of both, x cannot be disconnected from z.
   So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. Could x be externally connected to z (EC)?
   If x is externally connected to z, they share a boundary but no interior. However, y is in the interior of both x and z. This contradicts the definition of EC.
   So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. Could x partially overlap z (PO)?
   Yes, this seems possible. x could extend beyond z in some areas, and z could extend beyond x in others, while they share some common region (which includes y).

4. Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)?
   Yes, this seems possible. x could be entirely within z and touch z's boundary, while y is inside both x and z.

5. Could x be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP)?
   Yes, this seems possible. x could be entirely within z without touching z's boundary, with y inside both.

6. Could z be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi)?
   Given that y touches z's boundary and y is strictly inside x, it's possible that parts of z's boundary extend beyond x. So, I don't think z can be entirely within x touching x's boundary.
   Wait, let me think about this again. If y touches z's boundary and y is strictly inside x, then z must extend at least to the part of y that touches z's boundary. This doesn't necessarily mean z extends beyond x. So, TPPi(x,z) might be possible.

7. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi)?
   If z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, then how can y be touching z's boundary while being strictly inside x? This seems contradictory.
   Actually, I think NTPPi(x,z) is not possible. If z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is touching z's boundary, then y would be too close to x's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(x,y).

8. Could x be equal to z (EQ)?
   Yes, this seems possible. If x and z are the same region, then y can be inside both and touching the boundary of z (which is also the boundary of x), satisfying both NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me double-check my reasoning for each relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are disconnected, y cannot be part of both.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are externally connected, they don't share interior points, but y is in the interior of both.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can overlap, sharing a region (which includes y), while each extends beyond the other in some areas.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be entirely within z, touching z's boundary, with y inside both.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be entirely within z, not touching z's boundary, with y inside both.

6. TPPi(x,z): I'm not sure about this. Let me think...
   If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x. This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given NTPPi(x,y), y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary. And given TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary.
   
   If z touches x's boundary and y touches z's boundary, it's possible that y could be touching x's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(x,y).
   
   But wait, "touching the boundary" means sharing a point, not the entire boundary. So, z could touch x's boundary at points that y doesn't touch, and y could touch z's boundary at points that z doesn't touch x's boundary.
   
   Actually, I think TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is touching z's boundary, then y would be too close to the boundary of x.
   Wait, that's not necessarily true. If z is well inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y is inside z but touching z's boundary, y would still be inside x and might not touch x's boundary. So NTPPi(x,z) might be possible.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are equal, then NTPPi(x,y) means y is strictly inside x (and thus z). But TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary. These are contradictory.

Let me revisit the problematic cases:

6. TPPi(x,z): If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z touches x's boundary. Also, y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)). It's possible that the part of z's boundary that y touches is not the same as the part that touches x's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): If z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, and y is touching z's boundary, then y is still inside x. The boundary of z is not the same as the boundary of x, so y can touch z's boundary while being inside x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): If x and z are equal, then NTPPi(x,y) means y is strictly inside x (and thus z). But TPP(y,z) means y touches z's boundary. These are contradictory. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Wait, I need to check the case of NTPPi(x,z) more carefully. NTPPi(x,y) means y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary. TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary. If NTPPi(x,z), then z is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary. So, the boundary of z is not near the boundary of x.

Given that y touches z's boundary, and z is strictly inside x, y is still well inside x (not touching x's boundary), satisfying NTPPi(x,y). So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

Let me also double-check the case of TPPi(x,z). TPPi(x,z) means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. NTPPi(x,y) means y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary. TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If z touches x's boundary and y touches z's boundary, could y also touch x's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(x,y)? Let's visualize:
- x is a big circle.
- z is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at a point A.
- y is an even smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at a point B.

If B is the same as A, then y would touch x's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(x,y). But B doesn't have to be A. y can touch z's boundary at a point that's not where z touches x's boundary. In this case, y would still be strictly inside x, satisfying NTPPi(x,y).

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I need to revisit the case of EQ(x,z). EQ(x,z) means x and z are identical regions. NTPPi(x,y) means y is strictly inside x, and TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If x and z are the same, then y cannot be strictly inside x (without touching x's boundary) and also touch z's boundary (which is the same as x's boundary). This is a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let's review all the relations one more time:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are disconnected, y cannot be part of both.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are externally connected, they don't share interior points, but y is in the interior of both.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. x and z can overlap, sharing a region (which includes y), while each extends beyond the other in some areas.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible. x can be entirely within z, touching z's boundary, with y inside both.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. x can be entirely within z, not touching z's boundary, with y inside both.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be entirely within x, touching x's boundary, with y inside both and touching z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be strictly inside x without touching x's boundary, and y can be inside z touching z's boundary, while still being strictly inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z are equal, y cannot be strictly inside x and also touch z's boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

However, I think I need to reexamine the NTPPi(x,z) case one more time. 

NTPPi(x,z) means z is strictly inside x, not touching x's boundary. TPP(y,z) means y is inside z and touches z's boundary. NTPPi(x,y) means y is strictly inside x, not touching x's boundary.

So, z is inside x (not touching x's boundary), and y is inside z (touching z's boundary). The boundary of z is not the same as the boundary of x, so y can touch z's boundary while still being inside x without touching x's boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let's actually reason through the example I gave for TPPi(x,z) one more time:

- x is a big circle.
- z is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at a point A.
- y is an even smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at a point B.

Now, given that TPPi(x,z), z is inside x and touches x's boundary. For NTPPi(x,y), y must be strictly inside x without touching x's boundary. For TPP(y,z), y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If y touches z's boundary at a point where z touches x's boundary, then y would also touch x's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(x,y). So, y must touch z's boundary at a point where z doesn't touch x's boundary.

Is this possible? Yes, because z could be a large portion of x, touching x's boundary at only a small part. y could be inside z, touching z's boundary at a different part, thus still being far from x's boundary.

So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

Wait, I need to reconsider this more carefully.

TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(x,y) means that y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means that y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If z touches x's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, can y be strictly inside x without touching x's boundary?

Let's visualize:
- x is a big circle.
- z is a smaller circle inside x, touching x's boundary at a point A.
- y is an even smaller circle inside z, touching z's boundary at a point B.

If B is the same as A, then y would touch x's boundary, contradicting NTPPi(x,y). So, B must be different from A. But if y touches z's boundary at B, and z touches x's boundary at A, then y is not touching x's boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is possible.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, I've convinced myself that NTPPi(x,z) is indeed possible. But I'm still questioning TPPi(x,z). Let me think about it once more.

If TPPi(x,z), then z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.
If NTPPi(x,y), then y is strictly inside x without touching x's boundary.
If TPP(y,z), then y is inside z and touches z's boundary.

If z touches x's boundary at a point A, and y touches z's boundary at a point B, can y be strictly inside x without touching x's boundary? Yes, as long as B is not A. If B is a different point than A, then y can touch z's boundary without touching x's boundary, thus satisfying all three relations.

I've convinced myself that both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible, along with PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

The final answer is: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z).

Oh, wait, I should actually check the consistency of each relation individually. Let me do that by considering the composition table for RCC-8. Let me compose NTPPi(x,y) with TPP(y,z) and see if each of the relations I identified is in the result.

The composition of NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z) gives:
NTPPi(x,y) o TPP(y,z) = PO(x,z) v TPP(x,z) v NTPP(x,z) v TPPi(x,z) v NTPPi(x,z)

So, according to the composition table, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

This confirms my analysis. The possible relationships between x and z are PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, and NTPPi.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships can exist between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

NTPPi(x,y) means y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
TPP(y,z) means y is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary.

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible - y cannot be in both x and z if they're disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible - if x and z only touch at boundaries, y cannot be in both.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x and z can partially overlap, with y in their intersection.

4. TPP(x,z): Possible - x can be entirely inside z, touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): Possible - x can be entirely inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be inside x and touch x's boundary, while y touches z's boundary at a different location than where z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be entirely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x equals z, y cannot both touch z's boundary and not touch x's boundary.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
