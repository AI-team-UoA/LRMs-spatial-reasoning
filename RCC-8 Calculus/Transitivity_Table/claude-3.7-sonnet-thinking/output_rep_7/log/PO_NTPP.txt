PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since PO(x,y), x extends beyond y in some region and also shares some part with y. And since NTPP(y,z), y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let's consider all the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But we know a part of x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z. So, x must have some part inside z as well. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundary but don't share any interior parts. However, since a part of x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z (without touching z's boundary), a part of x must also be inside z. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible either.

3. PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap. This is possible. A part of x (the part that overlaps with y) is inside z, but the remaining part of x can be outside z.

4. TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if the entire x is inside z and some part of x (that doesn't overlap with y) touches the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, meaning x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if the entire x is inside z and no part of x touches the boundary of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know that z contains y, and y overlaps with x. This means z extends beyond the part of x that overlaps with y. So, z cannot be completely inside x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same, then the relation between x and y would be the same as the relation between z and y, which is NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y). But we're given that PO(x,y). Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

But wait, let me double-check my reasoning for TPP(x,z). I said it's possible if the entire x is inside z and some part of x (that doesn't overlap with y) touches the boundary of z. But I need to ensure this is consistent with the given conditions.

We know that PO(x,y), so x and y share a part, and neither is contained in the other. And NTPP(y,z), so y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

If TPP(x,z), then x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Since y doesn't touch z's boundary, the part of x that touches z's boundary must be outside of y. This is consistent with PO(x,y) because in a partial overlap, a part of x extends beyond y.

So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

Similarly, for NTPP(x,z), it's possible if the entire x is inside z and no part of x touches the boundary of z. This too is consistent with PO(x,y) because the part of x that extends beyond y could still be inside z without touching its boundary.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, I'm still not fully convinced. Let me revisit my reasoning. 

Actually, let me re-verify whether NTPP(x,z) and TPP(x,z) are possible by drawing some mental diagrams.

For NTPP(x,z), I would have x completely inside z without touching the boundary of z, and I would have y completely inside z without touching the boundary of z, and x and y would partially overlap. Yes, I can construct such a mental diagram, so NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z), I would have x completely inside z but touching the boundary of z, and I would have y completely inside z without touching the boundary of z, and x and y would partially overlap. Again, I can construct such a mental diagram, so TPP(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z), I would have x and z partially overlapping, y completely inside z without touching the boundary of z, and x and y partially overlapping. I can also construct such a mental diagram, so PO(x,z) is possible.

Let me check the remaining options again to ensure they're not possible.

For DC(x,z), I would need x and z to be disconnected. But since a part of x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, a part of x must also be inside z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z), I would need x and z to touch at their boundary but not share any interior parts. Again, since a part of x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z, a part of x must also be inside z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z), I would need z to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. But we know that z contains y, and y overlaps with x. This means z extends beyond the part of x that overlaps with y. So, z cannot be completely inside x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), I would need z to be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

For EQ(x,z), I would need x and z to be the same. If x and z are the same, then the relation between x and y would be the same as the relation between z and y, which is NTPPi(y,z) or NTPP(z,y). But we're given that PO(x,y). Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

So that is the answer.

Actually, I should also consider whether the constraints PO(x, y) and NTPP(y, z) could together imply that x also has to be a TPP(x, z) or a NTPP(x, z).

Let's consider NTPP(y,z) again. This means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Given PO(x,y), we know x and y share a part, and neither is contained in the other. This means a part of x is inside y (and hence inside z), and a part of x is outside y.

Now, the part of x that's outside y can be either inside z or outside z.

If it's inside z, then the entire x is inside z. Depending on whether x touches the boundary of z or not, we would have TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z).

If it's outside z, then a part of x is inside z (the part that overlaps with y) and a part of x is outside z. This gives us PO(x,z).

So, all three relations (PO, TPP, NTPP) between x and z are possible given the constraints.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z given that PO(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

PO(x,y) means:
- x and y partially overlap
- They share some part
- Neither is contained in the other

NTPP(y,z) means:
- y is completely inside z
- y does not touch z's boundary

Now I'll analyze possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible. Since x overlaps with y and y is inside z, x must share some part with z.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible. Since part of x overlaps with y, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, x must have interior overlap with z.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible. Part of x can overlap with z (the part that overlaps with y), while another part of x extends outside of z.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible. The entirety of x could be inside z with x touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible. The entirety of x could be inside z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible. Since y is completely inside z and y partially overlaps with x, z cannot be contained within x.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would have the same relationship with both, which contradicts our premises.
