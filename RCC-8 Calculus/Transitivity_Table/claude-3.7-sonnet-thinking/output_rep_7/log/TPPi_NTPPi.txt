PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully go through this question.

We're given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), and we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's understand what these relations mean:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

So, we have:
- y is contained within x and touches x's boundary
- z is contained within y and does not touch y's boundary

Now, let's determine the possible relationship between x and z. Given the nesting, we know that z is contained within y, and y is contained within x. So, z is definitely contained within x as well.

The question is whether z touches x's boundary or not. Since z does not touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, it means z is separated from x's boundary by at least the distance between z and y's boundary. Hence, z cannot touch x's boundary.

So, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I need to double-check this. Let's think about it more carefully.

If TPPi(x,y), then y is a tangential proper part of x, which means y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.

If NTPPi(y,z), then z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which means z is properly contained in y and does not touch y's boundary.

Now, z is properly contained in y, and y is properly contained in x. So, z is properly contained in x. 

The question is whether z touches x's boundary. Since z does not touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, z is separated from x's boundary by at least some part of y. Hence, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I should be a bit more careful here.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

So, we have:
- y is contained within x and touches x's boundary
- z is contained within y and does not touch y's boundary

Given this, z is contained within x (because z is contained within y, and y is contained within x). 

Now, the question is whether z touches x's boundary. Since z does not touch y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary, it seems that z is separated from x's boundary by at least the distance between z and y's boundary. Hence, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, actually, let me approach this a bit differently, just to make sure I'm not making a logical error:

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x, so y is contained within x and touches x's boundary.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, so z is contained within y and does not touch y's boundary.

So, we have a nesting: z is contained within y, which is contained within x.

The key to determining the relationship between x and z is to figure out if z touches x's boundary.

Let's visualize this:
- y is inside x and touches x's boundary
- z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary

Given this arrangement, z is inside x (because it's inside y, which is inside x). But z cannot touch x's boundary, because it's separated from x's boundary by at least some part of y (since z doesn't touch y's boundary).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, actually, let me reconsider the given relations one more time.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x. 
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, we have:
- y is a tangential proper part of x
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, it follows that z is a proper part of x. But is z a tangential or non-tangential proper part of x?

Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it means z doesn't touch y's boundary. And given that y is a tangential proper part of x, it means y touches x's boundary.

Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is what connects z to x's boundary, it seems like z can't touch x's boundary. Therefore, z should be a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this more carefully, because there's a subtle point here: 

When we say "z doesn't touch y's boundary," it doesn't necessarily mean that z is far from y's boundary. It just means that z's boundary doesn't intersect with y's boundary. Similarly, when we say "y touches x's boundary," it means that y's boundary intersects with x's boundary.

Given these, if z doesn't touch y's boundary and y touches x's boundary, can z touch x's boundary?

For z to touch x's boundary, some part of z's boundary would need to intersect with x's boundary. But since z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, z's boundary is separated from x's boundary by at least the part of y that lies between z and x's boundary. Therefore, z cannot touch x's boundary.

So, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

OK, now let me think about this one more time from a different angle.

First, let's clarify the relations we're given:

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which can be written as TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which can be written as NTPP(z,y).

So, we have:
- TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, we're trying to determine the possible RCC-8 relation between x and z.

Since z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, z is definitely a proper part of x. The question is whether z is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)).

For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to touch x's boundary. But given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, z doesn't touch y's boundary. And since y is a tangential proper part of x, y touches x's boundary.

This means that z is separated from x's boundary by the parts of y that are between z and x's boundary. So, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me just double-check using the definition of the relations:

- TPP(a,b): a is a tangential proper part of b. This means a is properly contained in b and touches b's boundary.
- NTPP(a,b): a is a non-tangential proper part of b. This means a is properly contained in b and does not touch b's boundary.

Given TPP(y,x) and NTPP(z,y), we know that y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary. And z is properly contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

For z to touch x's boundary, it would need to have a point in common with x's boundary. But since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is the entity that touches x's boundary, z is separated from x's boundary by at least some part of y. So, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I'm confident in my answer now: The possible relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or, equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, before I finalize my answer, let me revisit the question to make sure I haven't overlooked anything.

We have TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), and we're asked to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which is TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(y,z) means that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, which is NTPP(z,y).

So, we have:
- TPP(y,x): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPP(z,y): z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, we've established that z is a proper part of x. The question is whether z is a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)) or a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x)).

For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to touch x's boundary. But given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y, z doesn't touch y's boundary. And since y is a tangential proper part of x, y touches x's boundary.

This means that z is separated from x's boundary by the parts of y that are between z and x's boundary. So, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, but I'm now second-guessing whether I've considered all possible scenarios. Let me just visualize this to make sure:

x is a region. y is a region inside x, and y touches x's boundary. z is a region inside y, and z doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given this, z is definitely inside x. But can z touch x's boundary?

For z to touch x's boundary, there would need to be a point on z's boundary that is also on x's boundary. But since z doesn't touch y's boundary, all points on z's boundary are inside y. And since y touches x's boundary but is a proper part of x, there's a barrier of y between z and x's boundary. So, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

I'm now confident in my answer. The only possible relationship between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. Let me re-verify what TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) mean.

TPPi(x,y) means TPP(y,x), which means y is a tangential proper part of x.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

So, we have:
- y is a tangential proper part of x
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y

Based on these, z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x. Therefore, z is a proper part of x.

The question is whether z touches x's boundary. Given that z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y is the entity that touches x's boundary, z is separated from x's boundary by at least some part of y. So, z cannot touch x's boundary.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

I think I've been clear enough now. The answer is NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given TPPi(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these relations mean:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is properly contained in x and touches x's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is properly contained in y and does not touch y's boundary.

Given these relations, I know that:
1. y is inside x and touches x's boundary
2. z is inside y and does not touch y's boundary

From this arrangement, it follows that z is inside x (because z is inside y which is inside x). 

The key question is: Can z touch x's boundary? Since z doesn't touch y's boundary, and y forms a "buffer" between z and x's boundary (as y touches x's boundary), z cannot touch x's boundary. There is always some part of y between z and x's boundary.

Therefore, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x, which is represented as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
