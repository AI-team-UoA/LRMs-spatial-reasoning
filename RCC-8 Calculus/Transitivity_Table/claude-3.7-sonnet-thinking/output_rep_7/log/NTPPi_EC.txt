PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the given relationships:

1. NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is entirely contained within x and does not touch the boundary of x.

2. EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but their interiors do not overlap.

Now, let's reason about the possible relationships between x and z:

Given that y is entirely contained within x and does not touch x's boundary, and y touches z at their boundaries, we need to determine how z can relate to x.

Since y is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary) and z touches y, z cannot be entirely outside of x (i.e., DC(x,z) is not possible).

Let's go through each of the eight possible RCC-8 relations between x and z and determine which ones are possible:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   This would mean x and z share no spatial parts and do not touch. But since z touches y, which is inside x, this relation is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   This means x and z touch at their boundaries but their interiors do not overlap. Since y is inside x and touches z, z must reach at least up to the boundary of x. If z does not extend inside x, then x and z would touch at their boundaries, making EC(x,z) a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   This means x and z share some parts, but neither is contained entirely within the other. Since z touches y, and y is entirely inside x, it's possible for z to partially enter x and overlap with it. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   This would mean x is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary. Given that y is inside x and y touches z, it's not immediately clear if this is possible. Let's think about it: if x is a proper part of z, then everything inside x, including y, is also inside z. But then how can y be externally connected to z? It would be inside z, not touching its boundary. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   This would mean x is entirely within z and does not touch z's boundary. As with TPP, if x is inside z, then y is also inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   This means z is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside x and y touches z, it's possible for z to be inside x and touching its boundary. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   This means z is entirely within x and does not touch x's boundary. But given that z touches y, and y does not touch x's boundary, it's possible for z to be entirely inside x without touching its boundary. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   This would mean x and z are the same region. But if x and z are the same, and y is inside x, then y would be inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Actually, I need to reconsider TPPi(x,z). If z is a tangential proper part of x, and y is a non-tangential proper part of x, it means both z and y are inside x. If z touches the boundary of x and y doesn't, can they still be externally connected? Let's think about this. If z is inside x and touches its boundary, and y is inside x and doesn't touch its boundary, then y and z would need to be positioned in such a way that they touch each other. This is geometrically possible, so TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z), if z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y is also entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, can y and z be externally connected? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries, so NTPPi(x,z) is also a valid possibility.

Let's double-check EC(x,z). If x and z touch at their boundaries, and y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, can y be externally connected to z? This would mean z touches y, which is inside x, but z doesn't enter x's interior. This seems contradictory. If y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and z touches y, then z must enter x's interior to some extent. So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship after all.

Let's also double-check PO(x,z). If x and z partially overlap, and y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, can y be externally connected to z? If z partially overlaps with x, then part of z is inside x and part is outside. It's possible for the part of z that's inside x to touch y, while the rest of z extends outside of x. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

I think I made a mistake in my reasoning for EC(x,z). Let's revisit it.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries.

Now, if y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and z touches y at their boundaries, then part of z must enter x to touch y. But if part of z enters x, then x and z would share interior parts, which contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

Actually, I think the confusion arises because I'm visualizing these regions in a 2D Euclidean space. Let me clarify: In RCC-8, regions can have arbitrary shapes and topologies. If y is a non-tangential proper part of x (completely inside x without touching its boundary), and y is externally connected to z (touches z at its boundary), then z must reach at least up to y, which is inside x. This means z and x must share some spatial part, even if just a boundary. So, DC(x,z) is definitely not possible.

Let me reconsider each relation again, carefully.

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   Not possible, as explained above. Since y is inside x and touches z, z cannot be completely separate from x.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   If x and z touch at their boundaries, and y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, and y touches z at their boundaries, then z would have to "reach inside" x to touch y. This would mean x and z share interior parts, contradicting EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   If x and z partially overlap, part of z is inside x and part is outside. It's possible for the part of z that's inside x to touch y, making PO(x,z) a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. If x is inside z, then y is also inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   This would mean x is entirely within z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, if x is inside z, then y is also inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   This means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. It's possible for z to also touch y, which is inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   This means z is entirely within x and doesn't touch x's boundary. It's possible for z to be inside x and touch y, which is also inside x. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   If x and z are the same region, then y is inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to double-check my reasoning again. Let's think through this step by step using a more formal approach.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. This means y is entirely inside x and does not touch x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but their interiors do not overlap.

Now, let's analyze each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   If x and z are disconnected, then there's no spatial overlap or boundary connection between them. But since y is inside x and touches z, there must be some connection between x and z. So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   If x and z are externally connected, they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. For y to be inside x and touch z, z would have to "reach inside" x to touch y, which means x and z would share interior parts. This contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   If x and z partially overlap, part of z is inside x and part is outside. It's possible for the part of z that's inside x to touch y, making EC(y,z) true. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   If x is a tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely inside z and touches z's boundary. This means y is also inside z, since y is inside x. But if y is inside z, it cannot be externally connected to z (it would be inside z, not touching its boundary). So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   If x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is entirely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, this means y is inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   If z is a tangential proper part of x, then z is inside x and touches x's boundary. It's possible for z to also touch y, which is inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   If z is a non-tangential proper part of x, then z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is also inside x, it's possible for z and y to touch at their boundaries. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship. 
   
   Wait, actually, I need to check if this configuration is possible. If z doesn't touch x's boundary, and y also doesn't touch x's boundary, can y and z still be externally connected?

   Let's think about it spatially. y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Can y and z touch at their boundaries? Yes, this is geometrically possible. For instance, picture x as a large circle, y as a small circle inside x, and z as another small circle inside x, where y and z touch at a point. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   If x and z are the same region, then y is inside z, which contradicts EC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relationship.

So, after careful consideration, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to reconsider PO(x,z) one more time. If x and z partially overlap, and y is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, can y be externally connected to z?

In a partial overlap scenario, part of z is inside x and part is outside. For y to be externally connected to z, y would need to touch z at their boundaries. But y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. So, y would need to touch the part of z that extends inside x. 

Is this possible? Yes. Picture x as a large circle, y as a small circle inside x (not touching x's boundary), and z as a shape that partially overlaps with x, such that the part of z inside x touches y. So, PO(x,z) is a valid possibility.

One more check: given that y is non-tangentially inside x, and y is externally connected to z, can z be tangentially inside x? That is, can TPPi(x,z) be true?

In the TPPi(x,z) scenario, z is inside x and touches x's boundary. y is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Can y and z be externally connected in this configuration? Yes, it's possible for y and z to touch at their boundaries while both being inside x. So, TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

So, after careful consideration, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Rechecking again: We need to make sure that y and z can indeed be EC (externally connected) in each of these configurations.

1. PO(x,z): Part of z is inside x and part is outside. y is entirely inside x. Can y and z be externally connected? Yes, the part of z inside x can touch y at their boundaries.

2. TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. y is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Can y and z be externally connected? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries while both being inside x.

3. NTPPi(x,z): z is entirely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. y is also inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Can y and z be externally connected? Yes, they can touch at their boundaries while both being inside x. Picturing two small circles inside a large circle, where the two small circles touch each other.

Ok, I think these are the possible relationships between x and z: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. EC(y,z) means y and z are externally connected. They touch at their boundaries but their interiors do not overlap. 

But in the PO(x,z) scenario, part of z is inside x and part is outside. For y to be externally connected to z, y would need to touch the part of z inside x at their boundaries. But then, the part of z inside x would need to be such that it doesn't overlap with y's interior. 

Let's visualize: y is inside x, and z is partially inside x. The part of z inside x touches y's boundary, but doesn't overlap with y's interior. This is geometrically possible, so PO(x,z) is a valid possibility for the given conditions.

In the TPPi(x,z) scenario, z is inside x and touches x's boundary. For y and z to be externally connected, they should touch at their boundaries but not overlap in their interiors. Geometrically, this is possible. For instance, picture x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside x and touching its boundary, and y as another circle inside x, not touching x's boundary, but touching z's boundary.

In the NTPPi(x,z) scenario, z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. For y and z to be externally connected, they should touch at their boundaries but not overlap in their interiors. Again, this is geometrically possible. Picture x as a large circle, z and y as two smaller non-overlapping circles inside x, touching each other at a point.

So, to conclude, the possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, actually, one more check on TPPi(x,z).

NTPP(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. EC(y,z) means y and z touch but their interiors don't overlap. TPPi(x,z) means z is inside x and touches x's boundary.

Let's visualize: x is a big region, y is a region inside x not touching the boundary, z is a region inside x touching the boundary. Can y and z be externally connected in this configuration?

Yes, because even though z touches the boundary of x, it can still be positioned in such a way that it also touches y's boundary, making y and z externally connected.

So, TPPi(x,z) is a valid possibility.

Let's consider the PO(x,z) case once more. If x and z partially overlap, there's a part of z inside x and a part outside. For y to be externally connected to z, y should touch z at its boundary. Since y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y would have to touch the part of z that extends inside x. Is this configuration consistent with the given conditions? Yes.

So, to conclude:
The possible relationships between x and z are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me try to simplify and summarize my reasoning:

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. 
- EC(y,z): y and z are externally connected.

Considering each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected:
   Not possible because y, which is inside x, touches z. This implies x and z must have some connection.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally connected:
   Not possible because if y is inside x and touches z, then z must "reach inside" x to touch y. This means x and z would share interior parts, contradicting EC.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   Possible. Part of z can be inside x, touching y, while the rest of z is outside x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential proper part:
   Not possible. If x is inside z, then y is also inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential proper part:
   Not possible for the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   Possible. z can be inside x, touch x's boundary, and also touch y.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   Possible. z can be inside x, not touch x's boundary, and still touch y.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal:
   Not possible. If x and z are the same, then y is inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

So, the final answer is: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to be extra cautious and double check these cases once more.

Given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is inside x, not touching x's boundary.
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries, but their interiors don't overlap.

Let's analyze each relation I've concluded as possible:

1. PO(x,z) - Partially overlapping:
   Imagine x as a large circle, y as a small circle inside x not touching x's boundary, and z as a shape that partially overlaps with x. The part of z inside x can touch y at their boundaries, while the part of z outside x doesn't interact with y. This is consistent with both NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

2. TPPi(x,z) - Inverse tangential proper part:
   Imagine x as a large circle, z as a smaller circle inside x touching x's boundary, and y as another circle inside x not touching x's boundary. If y and z are positioned so they touch at their boundaries, then we have NTPPi(x,y), TPPi(x,z), and EC(y,z) all satisfied.

3. NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse non-tangential proper part:
   Imagine x as a large circle, and both y and z as smaller circles inside x, not touching x's boundary. If y and z are positioned so they touch at their boundaries, then we have NTPPi(x,y), NTPPi(x,z), and EC(y,z) all satisfied.

All three configurations are geometrically possible, and I'm confident in my conclusion.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I just realized a potential issue with the PO(x,z) case. Let me think through it once more:

PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. Some parts of x are outside z, and some parts of z are outside x. Given that y is entirely inside x, can y be externally connected to z? 

There are a few ways this could happen:
1. y could touch the part of z that's inside x.
2. y could be right at the boundary of the overlap between x and z, touching z's boundary.

In the first case, if y is inside x and touches the part of z that's inside x, then they can be externally connected. So, PO(x,z) remains a valid possibility.

In the second case, if y is at the boundary of the overlap, then y would be touching both z's boundary and the boundary of the overlap between x and z. But since NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, y can't be at the boundary of the overlap between x and z. So, this configuration isn't valid.

But the first case is still valid, which means PO(x,z) is a possible relationship.

To summarize:
The possible relationships between x and z, given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given NTPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze what we know:
- NTPPi(x,y) means y is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- EC(y,z) means y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap

Now I'll check each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible. Since y is inside x and touches z, z cannot be completely disconnected from x.

2. EC(x,z): Not possible. If y is inside x (not touching x's boundary) and y touches z, then z must penetrate into x's interior, which contradicts EC.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. Part of z can extend inside x to touch y, while another part extends outside x.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were inside z, then y would also be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x, touch x's boundary, and also touch y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be entirely inside x (not touching x's boundary) and still touch y's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, y would be inside z, contradicting EC(y,z).

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
