PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's recall the definitions of the RCC-8 relations and see what constraints they place on the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
- PO(y,z): y and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.

The question asks for possible relationships between x and z.

Let's think about what we know about the positions of x, y, and z.

From EC(x,y), we know that x and y touch at the boundary but have no overlapping interior. So the interior of x is completely separate from the interior of y.

From PO(y,z), we know that y and z partially overlap. This means some part of y is inside z, and some part of z is inside y. But also, some part of y is outside z, and some part of z is outside y.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z could be completely disconnected. This could happen if the overlap between y and z is in a part of y that's away from the boundary where x and y touch.

2. EC(x,z): x and z could touch at a boundary. This could happen if the boundary where x and y touch is also a boundary of z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z could partially overlap. This could happen if z extends into x beyond the boundary where x and y touch.

4. TPP(x,z): x could be a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is entirely within z and touches the boundary of z. This could happen if z completely contains x, including the boundary where x and y touch.

5. NTPP(x,z): x could be a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is entirely within z and does not touch the boundary of z. This seems unlikely given that x must touch the boundary of y, and y and z partially overlap. For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, the boundary of y where x touches would need to be completely contained in z, but this contradicts the partial overlap of y and z.

6. TPPi(x,z): z could be a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is entirely within x and touches the boundary of x. This could happen if x completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x where x and y touch.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z could be a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is entirely within x and does not touch the boundary of x. This seems unlikely given that z must overlap with y, and y and x touch at a boundary. For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary where x and y touch, but this contradicts the partial overlap of y and z.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z could be equal. This seems unlikely given the constraints of EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), as it would imply that x and z occupy the same space, which would contradict x and y touching only at a boundary while y and z partially overlap.

Let me double-check some of these:

5. NTPP(x,z): Upon further reflection, this is actually possible. If z completely contains y except for a small part of y that extends beyond z, and x touches y only at the boundary that's contained within z, then x could be a non-tangential proper part of z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This seems less likely. For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary. But since z partially overlaps with y, and y touches x at the boundary, some part of z would need to be in the same region as y, which would place z near the boundary of x, contradicting the non-tangential requirement.

8. EQ(x,z): This seems impossible given the constraints. If x and z are equal, then PO(y,z) would imply PO(y,x), which contradicts EC(x,y).

Let me re-think 7. NTPPi(x,z) a bit more. Could z be a non-tangential proper part of x? 

For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary of x. But since z partially overlaps with y, and y touches x at the boundary, z must extend to the part of y that touches x. This would place z at the boundary of x, contradicting the non-tangential requirement. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider some of the other possibilities:

4. TPP(x,z): Is it actually possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z? For this to happen, x would need to be completely contained in z and touch the boundary of z. This could happen if z extends beyond the boundary where x and y touch.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it actually possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. Given that z partially overlaps with y, and y touches x at the boundary, this seems possible if z is contained within x and extends to the boundary where x and y touch.

Let me try to visualize these scenarios more clearly:

DC(x,z): This could happen if the overlap between y and z is in a part of y that's away from the boundary where x and y touch.

EC(x,z): This could happen if the boundary where x and y touch is also a boundary of z.

PO(x,z): This could happen if z extends into x beyond the boundary where x and y touch.

TPP(x,z): This would require x to be completely contained in z and touch the boundary of z. Given that x touches y at the boundary, and y and z partially overlap, this seems possible if z contains x and extends to the boundary where x and y touch.

NTPP(x,z): This would require x to be completely contained in z and not touch the boundary of z. This seems possible if z completely contains y except for a small part of y that extends beyond z, and x touches y only at the boundary that's contained within z.

TPPi(x,z): This would require z to be completely contained in x and touch the boundary of x. Given that z partially overlaps with y, and y touches x at the boundary, this seems possible if z is contained within x and extends to the boundary where x and y touch.

NTPPi(x,z): As discussed, this seems unlikely because z would need to be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary, but this contradicts the partial overlap of y and z.

EQ(x,z): This seems impossible given the constraints, as it would imply PO(y,x), which contradicts EC(x,y).

Actually, let me reconsider the case of NTPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z), z would need to be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary of x. Given that z partially overlaps with y, and y touches x at the boundary, it seems that z must extend to the part of y that touches x, which would place z at the boundary of x, contradicting the non-tangential requirement.

I'm having trouble visualizing this clearly. Let me try to break down the constraints more systematically.

From EC(x,y), we know:
- x and y touch at a boundary.
- The interiors of x and y are disjoint.

From PO(y,z), we know:
- y and z share a part of their interiors.
- Some part of y is outside z.
- Some part of z is outside y.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, with no common parts. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with z is away from the boundary where x and y touch.

EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if z extends to the boundary where x and y touch but doesn't go further into x.

PO(x,z): This means x and z share a part, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z extends into x beyond the boundary where x and y touch, but doesn't completely contain x, and x doesn't completely contain z.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching the boundary of z. This is possible if z completely contains x, and x touches the boundary of z.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching the boundary of z. This seems less likely, as x touches the boundary of y, and y and z partially overlap. For x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, x would need to be completely contained in the interior of z, away from the boundary, but this is possible if the part of y that x touches is completely contained in z.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching the boundary of x. This is possible if x completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x where x and y touch.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching the boundary of x. This seems less likely given the constraints, as z partially overlaps with y, and y touches x at the boundary. For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary, but this contradicts the partial overlap of y and z.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is impossible given the constraints, as it would imply PO(y,x), which contradicts EC(x,y).

Let me re-examine NTPP(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) more carefully.

NTPP(x,z): For this to be true, x must be completely contained in the interior of z, away from the boundary of z. Since x touches y at the boundary, and y and z partially overlap, this is possible if the part of y that x touches is completely contained in the interior of z.

Actually, let me reconsider NTPP(x,z). For this to be possible, x must be completely contained in the interior of z, away from the boundary of z. But x touches y at the boundary, and y and z partially overlap. Since y and z partially overlap, some part of y is outside z. If x touches y at a boundary that's outside z, then x would not be completely contained in z, contradicting NTPP(x,z). If x touches y at a boundary that's inside z, then x could be a non-tangential proper part of z, but only if the boundary of y that x touches is also an interior point of z. If y touches z at its boundary, then x would touch the boundary of z, contradicting NTPP(x,z). So for NTPP(x,z) to be possible, y must overlap with z in such a way that the boundary of y that x touches is an interior point of z. This seems like a fairly specific scenario, and I'm not entirely convinced it's possible, but let's keep it as a possibility for now.

NTPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z must be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary of x. But since z partially overlaps with y, and y touches x at the boundary, z must extend to the part of y that touches x. This would place z at the boundary of x, contradicting the non-tangential requirement. So, NTPPi(x,z) does not seem possible.

Let me carefully reconsider NTPPi(x,z) once more. For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z must be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary of x. But since z partially overlaps with y, z must share some interior points with y. Now, y touches x at the boundary. The overlap between y and z could be in a part of y that's away from where y touches x. So z could be completely contained in the interior of x, and the overlap between y and z could be in a part of y that's also in the interior of x. In this scenario, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x. So, upon further reflection, NTPPi(x,z) does seem possible.

Let's verify again that EQ(x,z) is indeed impossible. If x and z were equal, then PO(y,z) would imply PO(y,x), which contradicts EC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's double-check these more carefully.

DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, with no common parts. This is possible if the part of y that overlaps with z is away from the boundary where x and y touch.

EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at a boundary but don't share any interior parts. This is possible if z extends to the boundary where x and y touch but doesn't go further into x.

PO(x,z): This means x and z share a part, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z extends into x beyond the boundary where x and y touch, but doesn't completely contain x, and x doesn't completely contain z.

TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, touching the boundary of z. This is possible if z completely contains x, and x touches the boundary of z where y also touches z.

NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, not touching the boundary of z. For this to be possible, x must be completely contained in the interior of z, away from the boundary of z. And as I've already argued, the specific scenario that would make this possible seems unlikely, as it would require the boundary of y that x touches to be an interior point of z. But if we're including all logically possible scenarios, I suppose we should include this.

TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, touching the boundary of x. This is possible if x completely contains z, and z touches the boundary of x where x and y touch.

NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, not touching the boundary of x. As I've argued, this is possible if z is completely contained in the interior of x, and the overlap between y and z is in a part of y that's also in the interior of x.

EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal. This is impossible given the constraints, as it would imply PO(y,x), which contradicts EC(x,y).

Ok, so based on this analysis, it seems like seven relationships are possible: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double check once more the case of NTPP(x,z).

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely contained in the interior of z, away from the boundary of z. We know that x touches y at the boundary, and y and z partially overlap. 

If x touches y at a boundary that's outside z, then x would not be completely contained in z, contradicting NTPP(x,z). 

If x touches y at a boundary that's inside z, then for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, the boundary of y that x touches must be an interior point of z. This seems like a quite specific scenario, as it would require y to extend into z in a way that the boundary of y is an interior point of z. I'm having trouble visualizing this, as it would seem to contradict the nature of boundaries as being on the exterior of objects. But perhaps in some complex geometric shapes, this is possible.

Actualy, let me reconsider once more. If y and z partially overlap, then there's a boundary of y that's inside z. If x touches y at this boundary, then x would still touch the boundary of y, but it could be completely contained in the interior of z. This would make NTPP(x,z) possible. So I think NTPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

Actually, let me think of a specific example:

Let's say y is a circle, and z is a larger circle that overlaps with y, such that a significant part of y is inside z, but a part of y is outside z. Now, let x be a circle that touches y at the boundary, at a point that's well inside z. In this case, x could be completely contained in the interior of z, making NTPP(x,z) possible.

So I'll stick with my conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double check the case of TPP(x,z) again.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely contained in z and must touch the boundary of z. We know that x touches y at the boundary, and y and z partially overlap.

If x touches y at a boundary that's outside z, then x would not be completely contained in z, contradicting TPP(x,z).

If x touches y at a boundary that's inside z, then for x to be a tangential proper part of z, x must also touch the boundary of z. This could happen if x touches y at a point that's inside z, but x also extends to the boundary of z at some other point.

Given that x and y touch only at the boundary, and y and z partially overlap, I'm trying to envision a scenario where x is completely contained in z and touches the boundary of z. It's a bit complex, but I think it's possible.

For example, imagine y is a circle, and z is another circle that overlaps with y, such that a part of y is inside z, and a part of y is outside z. Let x be a circle that touches y at the boundary, at a point that's inside z. Now, if x is positioned in such a way that it also touches the boundary of z at some point, then x would be a tangential proper part of z. This seems possible.

But I wonder if it adds additional constraints on the relation between x and y, or y and z. Let's see.

If x touches the boundary of z, and x is completely contained in z, then x is a tangential proper part of z. This doesn't seem to contradict EC(x,y) or PO(y,z), so I think TPP(x,z) is indeed a possibility.

So I'll confirm that the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double check TPPi(x,z) as well to make sure.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and must touch the boundary of x. We know that x touches y at the boundary, and y and z partially overlap.

If z is completely contained in x, then the part of y that overlaps with z must also be contained in x. But y touches x only at the boundary, not in the interior. This seems to create a contradiction. If y touches x only at the boundary, and z is completely contained in x, then how can y and z overlap?

Actually, upon further reflection, TPPi(x,z) is still possible. y can touch x at the boundary, and z can be completely contained in x. The overlap between y and z could be at the boundary where y touches x. In this scenario, z would be a tangential proper part of x, touching the boundary of x at the same point where y touches x. This would make TPPi(x,z) possible.

But wait, in RCC-8, if y touches x only at the boundary, then the interiors of x and y are disjoint. And if z is completely contained in x, then the interior of z is contained in the interior of x. Given that y and z partially overlap, the interior of y and the interior of z share some points. But since the interior of y is disjoint from the interior of x, and the interior of z is contained in the interior of x, the interior of y and the interior of z cannot share any points. This contradicts PO(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible. Let me re-think this.

Actually, perhaps I was being too stringent. Let me try again. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points. PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior points, some part of y is outside z, and some part of z is outside y.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and must touch the boundary of x. If z is completely contained in x, then the part of y that overlaps with z must also be contained in x. But this contradicts EC(x,y), which says that the interiors of x and y are disjoint. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I am being a bit sloppy here, sorry. Let me re-think the case of TPPi(x,z) once more.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and must touch the boundary of x. We know that x touches y at the boundary, and y and z partially overlap.

If z is completely contained in x, then any overlap between y and z must be at the boundary of x, where y touches x. But PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior points. If y and x touch only at the boundary, then the interior of y is disjoint from x. And if z is completely contained in x, then any overlap between y and z must be in x. But since the interior of y is disjoint from x, and z is contained in x, the interior of y and z cannot overlap. This contradicts PO(y,z). So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

OK, let me reconsider yet again, because I think I am making a mistake somewhere.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points. PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior points, some part of y is outside z, and some part of z is outside y.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and must touch the boundary of x. If z is completely contained in x, then any part of z is also in x. Given that y and z partially overlap, there are some points that are in both y and z. These points are in z, and hence also in x. But this contradicts EC(x,y), which says that the interiors of x and y are disjoint. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Actually I'm still confused about TPPi(x,z). Let me try to draw a diagram to clarify.

Let's say x is a circle, y is another circle that touches x at the boundary, and z is a smaller circle completely contained in x, that also touches the boundary of x at the same point where y touches x. In this scenario, z is a tangential proper part of x, and y and z touch at a point, but they don't overlap. But wait, PO(y,z) requires y and z to overlap, not just touch. So, in this scenario, TPPi(x,z) would not be possible.

Let's try another scenario. Let's say x is a circle, y is another circle that touches x at the boundary, and z is a smaller circle completely contained in x, that also touches the boundary of x at a different point from where y touches x. In this scenario, z is a tangential proper part of x, but y and z are disconnected. This contradicts PO(y,z), which requires y and z to overlap. So, in this scenario, TPPi(x,z) would not be possible.

I'm finding it hard to envision a scenario where TPPi(x,z) is possible while maintaining EC(x,y) and PO(y,z). Let me try one more approach.

If TPPi(x,z) is true, then z is completely contained in x and touches the boundary of x. If EC(x,y) is true, then x and y touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points. If PO(y,z) is true, then y and z share some interior points, some part of y is outside z, and some part of z is outside y.

Let's consider the part of y that overlaps with z. Since y and z overlap, there are some interior points of y that are also in z. Since z is completely contained in x, these points are also in x. But this contradicts EC(x,y), which says that the interiors of x and y are disjoint. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

I'm now confident that TPPi(x,z) is not possible given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me also reconsider the case of NTPPi(x,z).

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary of x. We know that x touches y at the boundary, and y and z partially overlap.

If z is completely contained in the interior of x, then any part of z is also in the interior of x. Given that y and z partially overlap, there are some points that are in both y and z. These points are in z, and hence also in the interior of x. But this contradicts EC(x,y), which says that the interiors of x and y are disjoint. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So now I am concluding that neither TPPi(x,z) nor NTPPi(x,z) are possible, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z).

Let me continue to double check the other scenarios.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely contained in z and must touch the boundary of z. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is this possible?

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points. PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior points, some part of y is outside z, and some part of z is outside y.

If x is completely contained in z, then any part of x is also in z. Given that x touches y at the boundary, this boundary point is in x, and hence also in z. So the boundary where x and y touch is also in z. Is this possible given PO(y,z)? PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior points, but not all. If the boundary where x and y touch is in z, then this boundary point of y is in z. This doesn't contradict PO(y,z), as this is a boundary point, not an interior point. So I think TPP(x,z) is still possible.

Actually, I'm not sure if I was thinking about this correctly. The boundary point where x and y touch is a part of y, but is it in the interior of y? No, it's on the boundary of y. So this point doesn't contribute to the partial overlap of y and z.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely contained in z and must touch the boundary of z. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), I was previously trying to figure out whether it's possible. I'm now thinking that it is possible.

EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points. PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior points, some part of y is outside z, and some part of z is outside y.

Let's say x is a circle, y is another circle that touches x at the boundary, and z is a larger circle that contains x completely, such that x touches the boundary of z at some point. The overlap between y and z could be in a part of y that's away from where y touches x. In this scenario, TPP(x,z) would be possible.

Actually, let me see if this works. Imagine y is a large circle, x is a smaller circle that touches y at the boundary, and z is a circle that overlaps with y, such that z completely contains x, and x touches the boundary of z at some point. In this scenario, EC(x,y), PO(y,z), and TPP(x,z) all hold. So, TPP(x,z) is indeed possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be completely contained in the interior of z, away from the boundary of z. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is this possible?

Let's say y is a large circle, x is a smaller circle that touches y at the boundary, and z is a larger circle that completely contains x, such that x is well inside z, away from the boundary of z. The overlap between y and z could be in a part of y that's away from where y touches x. In this scenario, NTPP(x,z) would be possible.

Actually, I think, for NTPP(x,z) to hold, the part of y that touches x should be inside z. In that case, part of y is inside z, and part of y is outside z, so PO(y,z) holds. x touches y at the boundary, so EC(x,y) holds. And x is completely contained in the interior of z, so NTPP(x,z) holds. This scenario seems possible.

So I think my final list of possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me double check DC(x,z) as well.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z must be disconnected, with no common parts. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is this possible?

Let's say y is a large circle, x is a smaller circle that touches y at the boundary, and z is another circle that overlaps with y in a part of y that's away from where y touches x. In this scenario, DC(x,z) would be possible. So DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z must touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is this possible?

Let's say y is a large circle, x is a smaller circle that touches y at the boundary, and z is another circle that overlaps with y, such that z touches x at the boundary, at the same point where y touches x. In this scenario, EC(x,z) would be possible. So EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some interior points, some part of x is outside z, and some part of z is outside x. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is this possible?

Let's say y is a large circle, x is a smaller circle that touches y at the boundary, and z is another circle that overlaps with y, such that z also overlaps with x, but neither is completely contained in the other. In this scenario, PO(x,z) would be possible. So PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

OK, so I think my final list of possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me just double check once more that TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and must touch the boundary of x. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is this possible? If z is completely contained in x, then any part of z is also in x. But since y and z overlap, there are some points that are in both y and z. These points are in z, and hence also in x. But this contradicts EC(x,y), which says that the interiors of x and y are disjoint. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary of x. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is this possible? The same argument as above applies: if z is completely contained in the interior of x, then any part of z is also in the interior of x. But since y and z overlap, there are some points that are in both y and z. These points are in z, and hence also in the interior of x. But this contradicts EC(x,y), which says that the interiors of x and y are disjoint. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So I'm sticking with my conclusion that the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, wait, I need to be more careful about the definition of EC. The definition says "EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts." It doesn't explicitly say that the interiors are disjoint, but it's implied.

Let me try once more to check if TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and must touch the boundary of x. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is this possible? If z is completely contained in x, then any part of z is also in x. But since y and z overlap, there are some points in the interior of y that are also in the interior of z. These points are in the interior of z, and hence also in the interior of x. But EC(x,y) says that the interiors of x and y are disjoint. So, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in the interior of x, away from the boundary of x. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is this possible? The same argument as above applies: if z is completely contained in the interior of x, then any part of the interior of z is also in the interior of x. But since y and z overlap, there are some points in the interior of y that are also in the interior of z. These points are in the interior of z, and hence also in the interior of x. But EC(x,y) says that the interiors of x and y are disjoint. So, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So my final conclusion is that the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider the case of TPPi(x,z) one more time, as I now realize there is some subtlety.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z must be completely contained in x and must touch the boundary of x. EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at the boundary but don't share any interior points. PO(y,z) means that y and z share some interior points, some part of y is outside z, and some part of z is outside y.

So if TPPi(x,z) is true, then z is completely contained in x, and if PO(y,z) is true, then y and z share some interior points. This means that there are some points in the interior of y that are also in the interior of z. These points are in the interior of z, and since z is completely contained in x, these points are also in the interior of x. But EC(x,y) says that the interiors of x and y are disjoint. So we have a contradiction.

Hence TPPi(x,z) is not possible, and similarly, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So my final, final conclusion is that the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let's check the case of EQ(x,z) once more to be super sure.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z must be equal. Given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), is this possible? If x and z are equal, then x and z occupy the same space. But EC(x,y) says that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't share any interior points with y, while PO(y,z) says that y and z share some interior points. If x and z are equal, this would mean that x and y share some interior points, which contradicts EC(x,y). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, as I've concluded before, the possible relations between x and z, given EC(x,y) and PO(y,z), are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z based on the given conditions:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some parts, but neither is contained in the other)

Let me analyze each possible RCC-8 relation:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. If the overlap between y and z occurs in a part of y that's away from where x touches y, then x and z could be completely disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is possible. x and z could touch at the boundary point where x and y meet, without sharing interior parts.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible. z could partially extend into x beyond their boundary connection point.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible. x could be completely contained in z while touching z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible. If the part of y that x touches is completely inside z, then x could be fully in the interior of z.

6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible. If z were contained in x, then the overlap between y and z would place interior points of y inside x, contradicting EC(x,y).

7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. If x and z were identical, then y would have to both externally connect to x and partially overlap with x simultaneously, which is contradictory.
