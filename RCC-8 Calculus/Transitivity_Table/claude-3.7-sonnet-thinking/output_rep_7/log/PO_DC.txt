PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and DC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I'm given that PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), and I need to find all possible relationships between x and z. The relationships must be from the RCC-8 set: DC, EC, PO, TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, and EQ.

Let's think about what the given relations mean:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share a spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- DC(y,z): y and z are disconnected. They share no spatial parts.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
Given that y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), and x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), it's possible that the part of x that doesn't overlap with y is still disconnected from z. So, DC(x,z) is a possible relation.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
Since y and z are disconnected, for x and z to be externally connected, the part of x that doesn't overlap with y would need to touch z's boundary. This is possible, so EC(x,z) is a possible relation.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
This is also possible. Even though y and z are disconnected, the part of x that doesn't overlap with y could overlap with z. So, PO(x,z) is a possible relation.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
This means x is a part of z and touches z's boundary. Given that x partially overlaps with y, and y is disconnected from z, this would mean the part of x that overlaps with y would have to be completely inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, let me think more carefully. If x is a tangential proper part of z, that means that x is completely inside z, and touches z's boundary. And given that x and y share some part (because of PO(x,y)), that would mean that some part of y is inside z. But that contradicts DC(y,z), which means y and z are disconnected. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
Similar to the reasoning for TPP, if x is a non-tangential proper part of z, then x is completely inside z without touching its boundary. Again, since PO(x,y), this would mean some part of y is inside z, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, given that x partially overlaps with y, it's possible that z is entirely within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
Similar to TPPi, if z is completely inside x without touching its boundary, it's possible that z is entirely within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
If x and z are the same, and x partially overlaps with y, this would mean z also partially overlaps with y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Actually, I made a mistake in my reasoning for TPP and NTPP. Let me reconsider.

For TPP(x,z), x is a tangential proper part of z. This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. Given that x partially overlaps with y (PO(x,y)), and y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), this would mean that the part of x that overlaps with y is also inside z. But this contradicts DC(y,z) because it would mean y and z share some spatial part. So, TPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

For NTPP(x,z), similar reasoning applies. If x is completely inside z, and x partially overlaps with y, then y and z would share some spatial part, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not a possible relation.

Let me also reconsider the relationships TPPi and NTPPi.

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x. Given that y and z are disconnected (DC(y,z)), z cannot be in the part of x that overlaps with y. But it's possible for z to be in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. So, TPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

For NTPPi(x,z), similar reasoning applies. If z is completely inside x without touching its boundary, it's possible for z to be in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. So, NTPPi(x,z) is a possible relation.

I think there's a mistake in my previous reasoning. I need to be more careful. 

Given PO(x,y), we know that x and y overlap, but neither is a subset of the other. 
Given DC(y,z), we know that y and z are disconnected; they have no shared points.

Let's create a picture in our minds. Imagine x and y as overlapping regions in a 2D plane. Then, z is a region that is disconnected from y. Now, the question is: what could be the relationship between x and z?

Since y and z are disconnected, and x overlaps with y, it's guaranteed that some portion of x is disconnected from z (specifically, the part that overlaps with y). But what about the part of x that doesn't overlap with y?

1. DC(x,z): If the part of x that doesn't overlap with y also doesn't overlap with z, then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): If the part of x that doesn't overlap with y touches z at a boundary, then x and z are externally connected.

3. PO(x,z): If the part of x that doesn't overlap with y partially overlaps with z, then x and z partially overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): For x to be a tangential proper part of z, all of x would need to be inside z. But some of x overlaps with y, and y is disconnected from z. This is a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z, all of x would need to be inside z. This contradicts the given relations. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): For z to be a tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x and touch x's boundary. Given that y and z are disconnected, z would need to be in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. This is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): For z to be a non-tangential proper part of x, z would need to be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, z would need to be in the part of x that doesn't overlap with y. This is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): For x and z to be coincident, they would need to be the same region. But if x and y overlap, and z and y are disconnected, then x and z cannot be the same region. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check this.

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x is entirely within y or if the part of x that's not in y is still disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected. This is possible if the part of x that's not in y touches z at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if the part of x that's not in y overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. If x is a tangential proper part of z, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also have to overlap with y (since x is a part of z). But we're given that y and z are disconnected, so this is a contradiction. Thus, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Similar to TPP, this would require z to overlap with y, which contradicts DC(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within the part of x that's not in y and z touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within the part of x that's not in y and z doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident. If x and z are the same, and x partially overlaps with y, then z would also partially overlap with y. But we're given that y and z are disconnected, so this is a contradiction. Thus, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Now I'm going to be even more careful. Let's approach this systematically.

PO(x,y) means x and y share a spatial part, but neither is a subset of the other.
DC(y,z) means y and z are disconnected, sharing no spatial parts.

Let's think of x as having two parts: the part that overlaps with y (let's call it x_y) and the part that doesn't (let's call it x_not_y). Similarly, y has a part that overlaps with x (y_x) and a part that doesn't (y_not_x).

Now, given DC(y,z), we know that both y_x and y_not_x are disconnected from z.

Let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected.
This is possible if both x_y and x_not_y are disconnected from z. Given that x_y overlaps with y_x, and y_x is disconnected from z, x_y is also disconnected from z. If x_not_y is also disconnected from z, then the entire x is disconnected from z, satisfying DC(x,z).

2. EC(x,z): x and z are externally connected.
This is possible if x_not_y is externally connected to z, while x_y remains disconnected from z. Since x_y is disconnected from z (as it overlaps with y_x), for EC(x,z) to hold, x_not_y must be externally connected to z.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
This is possible if x_not_y partially overlaps with z, while x_y remains disconnected from z. For PO(x,z) to hold, x_not_y must partially overlap with z.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
For TPP(x,z) to hold, all of x must be inside z, and x must touch z's boundary. However, if x_y overlaps with y_x, and y_x is disconnected from z, then x_y can't be inside z. This contradicts the requirement for TPP. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
Similar to TPP, for NTPP(x,z) to hold, all of x must be inside z. But as we've established, x_y can't be inside z due to its overlap with y_x. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
For TPPi(x,z) to hold, all of z must be inside x, and z must touch x's boundary. Given DC(y,z), z must be inside x_not_y. This means z is a tangential proper part of x_not_y. If x_not_y is large enough to contain z such that z touches the boundary of x_not_y, then TPPi(x,z) is possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
For NTPPi(x,z) to hold, all of z must be inside x, and z must not touch x's boundary. Similar to TPPi, z must be inside x_not_y. If x_not_y is large enough to contain z such that z doesn't touch the boundary of x_not_y, then NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are coincident.
For EQ(x,z) to hold, x and z must be the same region. But if x_y overlaps with y_x, and y_x is disconnected from z, then x_y can't be the same as z. This contradicts the requirement for EQ. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Let me double-check once more with a visual representation:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disjoint.
2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at a boundary.
3. PO(x,z): x and z overlap, but neither is a subset of the other.
4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same.

Given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z), let's visualize:

- x and y overlap. Some part of x is inside y, and some part of y is inside x. But neither is a subset of the other.
- y and z are disjoint. They have no shared points.

For each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z):
   x and z are disjoint. This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y is also disjoint from z.

2. EC(x,z):
   x and z touch at a boundary. This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y touches z at a boundary.

3. PO(x,z):
   x and z overlap, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y overlaps with z.

4. TPP(x,z):
   x is a tangential proper part of z. This would require all of x to be inside z. However, part of x is inside y, and y is disjoint from z. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z):
   x is a non-tangential proper part of z. Like TPP, this would require all of x to be inside z, which is not possible. So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z):
   z is a tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, and z touches the boundary of x.

7. NTPPi(x,z):
   z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is possible if z is entirely within the part of x that doesn't overlap with y, and z doesn't touch the boundary of x.

8. EQ(x,z):
   x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then z would overlap with y. But this contradicts DC(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- DC(x,z)
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

This aligns with our previous answer, so I'm confident that these five relationships are the correct answer. So the final answer is DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z, given PO(x,y) and DC(y,z).

Let me analyze each potential relationship:

PO(x,y) means x and y partially overlap (share some space, but neither is fully contained in the other).
DC(y,z) means y and z are completely disconnected (share no space).

Considering each possible RCC-8 relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible - x can be disconnected from z if it doesn't extend beyond the parts of y that are disconnected from z.

2. EC(x,z): Possible - x can externally connect with z if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y touches z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z): Possible - x can partially overlap z if the part of x that doesn't overlap with y shares interior points with z.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible - if x were inside z and x overlaps with y, then y would have to overlap with z, contradicting DC(y,z).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible - same reasoning as TPP.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be inside x (touching its boundary) if z is contained entirely within the portion of x that doesn't overlap with y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible - z can be properly inside x if z is entirely within the portion of x that doesn't overlap with y.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible - if x and z were identical, and x overlaps with y, then z would also overlap with y, contradicting DC(y,z).
