PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We know that:
- EQ(x,y) means that x and y are coincident (they occupy the exact same spatial region).
- EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

We need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y occupy the exact same spatial region. This means that any spatial relationship that y has with other regions, x will have the same relationship with those regions.

Given that EC(y,z), it means that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

Since x and y are coincident (EQ(x,y)), x will have the exact same relationship with z as y does with z. Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be EC(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

1. EQ(x,y) means x and y occupy the exact same spatial region.
2. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.

Given the equivalence of x and y in terms of spatial extent, x must also touch z at a boundary without sharing any interior parts. This is the definition of EC(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Actually, let me think about this more carefully.

When EQ(x,y), it means x and y are exactly the same region. This means any relation that holds between y and another region z will also hold between x and z. 

In this case, we know EC(y,z), which means y and z touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. Given that x and y are the same region (EQ(x,y)), x will also touch z at a boundary without sharing any interior parts.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

Let me check once more to make sure there are no other possibilities:

The eight RCC-8 relations are:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

If EQ(x,y) and EC(y,z), then the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z). This is because EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region, so x must have the same relationship with z as y does.

The answer is: EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the relationship between x and z is constrained by the given relations.

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)
- EC(y,z): y and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts

Since EQ(x,y) means x and y are spatially identical, x must have exactly the same relationship with z as y does with z.

Since y and z are externally connected (EC), and x is identical to y, then x and z must also be externally connected.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
