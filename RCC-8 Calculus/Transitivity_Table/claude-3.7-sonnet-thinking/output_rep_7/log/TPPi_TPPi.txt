PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

First, I need to understand what TPPi(x,y) means. It means that TPP(y,x), i.e., y is a tangential proper part of x, which means that y is part of x and touches x's boundary.

Similarly, TPPi(y,z) means that TPP(z,y), i.e., z is a tangential proper part of y, which means that z is part of y and touches y's boundary.

So we have:
- y is part of x and touches x's boundary
- z is part of y and touches y's boundary

The question asks for the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that z is part of y (from TPP(z,y)) and y is part of x (from TPP(y,x)), by transitivity of the part-of relation, z is part of x.

Now, there are two possibilities for how z relates to x's boundary:
1. z touches x's boundary. In this case, z would be a tangential proper part of x, so TPP(z,x) or equivalently, TPPi(x,z).
2. z does not touch x's boundary. In this case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x, so NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Let's check if both of these are actually possible.

Case 1: TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).
Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z is also part of x. Since z touches y's boundary and y touches x's boundary, it's possible for z to also touch x's boundary. So TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z) is a possible relationship.

Case 2: NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).
Since z is part of y and y is part of x, z is also part of x. It's possible that z touches y's boundary but y's boundary includes parts that are interior to x (not on x's boundary). In such a case, z would not touch x's boundary and hence would be a non-tangential proper part of x. So NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z) is also a possible relationship.

I don't think any of the other relationships are possible:

- DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, which contradicts the fact that z is part of x.
- EC(x,z): This means x and z only share boundary points, which contradicts the fact that z is part of x.
- PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, which contradicts the fact that z is part of x.
- TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, which contradicts the fact that z is part of x.
- NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, which contradicts the fact that z is part of x.
- EQ(x,z): This means x and z are coincident, which contradicts the fact that z is part of y, and y is part of x, with y â‰  x (since y is a proper part of x).

But wait, let me double check my reasoning in Case 1. I said that "Since z touches y's boundary and y touches x's boundary, it's possible for z to also touch x's boundary." But is this necessarily true?

Let's think about it:
- z touches y's boundary
- y touches x's boundary

Does this guarantee that z touches x's boundary? Not necessarily. It's possible that z only touches parts of y's boundary that are interior to x, not parts of y's boundary that coincide with x's boundary. In such a case, z would not touch x's boundary and would be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z)).

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, TPP(z,x))
- NTPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, NTPP(z,x))

Actually, let me check that both of these are really possible.

Case 1: TPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, TPP(z,x)).
We have y touching x's boundary, and z touching y's boundary. For z to touch x's boundary, it must touch a part of y's boundary that coincides with x's boundary. Is this always guaranteed? Not necessarily. It depends on how y is situated within x and how z is situated within y.

If y touches x's boundary at a specific location, and z touches y's boundary at the same location, then z would also touch x's boundary, resulting in TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

Case 2: NTPPi(x,z) (or equivalently, NTPP(z,x)).
If z touches y's boundary only at locations that are interior to x (not on x's boundary), then z would not touch x's boundary. In this case, z would be a non-tangential proper part of x, resulting in NTPP(z,x) or NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me look more closely at both of these cases and check if they're consistent with the given constraints.

TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x.
TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y.

So we have:
- y is a proper part of x and touches x's boundary
- z is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary

For TPP(z,x) to be true, z must be a proper part of x and touch x's boundary.
For NTPP(z,x) to be true, z must be a proper part of x and not touch x's boundary.

Given that z is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of x, z is definitely a proper part of x. So the question is whether z touches x's boundary or not.

z touches y's boundary. If y's boundary includes parts of x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary at those specific parts, then z would also touch x's boundary, resulting in TPP(z,x). If z touches y's boundary only at parts that are interior to x, then z would not touch x's boundary, resulting in NTPP(z,x).

So both TPP(z,x) and NTPP(z,x) are possible relationships between z and x, which means both TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are possible answers.

To summarize, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relationships are possible between x and z given the conditions TPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

First, let me translate these relations:
- TPPi(x,y) means y is a tangential proper part of x (y is inside x and touches x's boundary)
- TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and touches y's boundary)

From these conditions, we know:
- z is inside y, which is inside x, so z must be inside x
- z touches y's boundary, and y touches x's boundary

There are two possible configurations for z relative to x:

1. z might touch x's boundary (if the part of y's boundary that z touches coincides with x's boundary). This would make z a tangential proper part of x, giving us TPP(z,x) or equivalently TPPi(x,z).

2. z might not touch x's boundary (if z only touches parts of y's boundary that are in the interior of x). This would make z a non-tangential proper part of x, giving us NTPP(z,x) or equivalently NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z)
