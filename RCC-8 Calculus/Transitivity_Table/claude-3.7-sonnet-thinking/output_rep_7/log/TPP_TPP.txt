PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let me think about this step by step.

We're given:
- TPP(x, y): x is a tangential proper part of y. This means x is entirely contained within y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- TPP(y, z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is entirely contained within z, and y touches the boundary of z.

We need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Since x is contained within y, and y is contained within z, we know that x is contained within z. But we need to be more specific about the relationship. Let's analyze the possibilities from the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x, z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is impossible because x is within y, and y is within z, so x must be within z.

2. EC(x, z) - x externally connected to z.
   This is impossible for the same reason. x must be within z.

3. PO(x, z) - x partially overlaps z.
   This means x and z share a part, but neither is contained within the other. This is impossible because x is within y, and y is within z, so x must be entirely within z.

4. TPP(x, z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible. If x touches the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z at the same location, then x would also touch the boundary of z.

5. NTPP(x, z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is also possible. If x touches the boundary of y, but y touches the boundary of z at a different location, then x would be entirely contained within z without touching z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x, z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This is impossible because x is within y, and y is within z, so z cannot be within x.

7. NTPPi(x, z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   This is impossible for the same reason.

8. EQ(x, z) - x and z are equal.
   This is impossible. If x is a proper part of y, and y is a proper part of z, then x cannot be equal to z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- TPP(x, z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x, z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Wait, let me double-check this. When we have TPP(x, y) and TPP(y, z), we're saying:
- x is within y and touches y's boundary.
- y is within z and touches z's boundary.

Now, for x and z:
- x is definitely within z because x is within y, and y is within z.
- The question is whether x touches z's boundary or not.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y also touches z's boundary, then x would touch z's boundary, making TPP(x, z) true.

If x touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x would be entirely within z without touching z's boundary, making NTPP(x, z) true.

Both of these scenarios are possible, so the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x, z) and NTPP(x, z).

Let's check one more time by visualizing. Imagine z as a large circle, y as a smaller circle within z that touches z's boundary, and x as an even smaller circle within y that touches y's boundary.

If x touches y's boundary at the same point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, making TPP(x, z) true.

If x touches y's boundary at a different point (where y doesn't touch z's boundary), then x would be entirely within z without touching z's boundary, making NTPP(x, z) true.

So, the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x, z) and NTPP(x, z).

Actually, wait. I need to clarify something. Let's think about this more carefully.

TPP(x, y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is a proper part of y and x touches the boundary of y.

TPP(y, z) means y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is a proper part of z and y touches the boundary of z.

For x and z, we know that x is a proper part of z because x is a proper part of y and y is a proper part of z. The question is whether x touches the boundary of z.

If x touches y's boundary at a point where y also touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, making TPP(x, z) true.

If x touches y's boundary only at points where y doesn't touch z's boundary, then x would be entirely within z without touching z's boundary, making NTPP(x, z) true.

Both of these scenarios are possible, so the possible relations between x and z are TPP(x, z) and NTPP(x, z).

Let me double-check my understanding.

Actually, I think I've been thinking about this correctly. Let me just double-check the RCC-8 relations to make sure.

1. DC(x, y): x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x, y): x and y are externally connected (they touch at the boundary but don't overlap).
3. PO(x, y): x and y partially overlap (they share a region, but neither is a part of the other).
4. TPP(x, y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is contained in y and touches y's boundary).
5. NTPP(x, y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (x is completely contained in y and doesn't touch y's boundary).
6. TPPi(x, y): y is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
7. NTPPi(x, y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
8. EQ(x, y): x and y are identical.

Given TPP(x, y) and TPP(y, z), the only possible relations between x and z are TPP(x, z) and NTPP(x, z).

So, the answer is: TPP(x, z) and NTPP(x, z).

I'll provide the final answer in the required format.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what happens when x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is a tangential proper part of z.

What we know:
- TPP(x,y): x is completely within y and touches y's boundary
- TPP(y,z): y is completely within z and touches z's boundary

Since x is contained within y, and y is contained within z, we know x must be completely within z. But there are two possibilities for how x relates to z's boundary:

1. TPP(x,z): This happens when x touches z's boundary. This is possible when x touches y's boundary at the exact point where y touches z's boundary.

2. NTPP(x,z): This happens when x doesn't touch z's boundary. This occurs when x only touches y's boundary at points where y doesn't touch z's boundary.

Both scenarios are consistent with the given constraints.
