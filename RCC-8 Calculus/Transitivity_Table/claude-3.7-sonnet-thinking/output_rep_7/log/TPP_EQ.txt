PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this carefully. We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y, meaning x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same spatial region.

Given that y and z are coincident (EQ(y,z)), they are essentially the same spatial region. So, any relation that x has with y, x should also have with z.

Since TPP(x,y), we know that x is a tangential proper part of y. And since y and z are the same spatial region (EQ(y,z)), x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

So, the relationship between x and z would be TPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this:

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a proper part of y
- x touches y's boundary

EQ(y,z) means:
- y and z are spatially equivalent

Given that y and z are spatially equivalent, and x is a tangential proper part of y, x must also be a tangential proper part of z. So, the answer is TPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine how the given relations constrain the relationship between x and z.

Given:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is part of y and touches y's boundary)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same spatial region)

Since EQ(y,z) means that y and z are spatially identical, any relation that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. 

If x is a tangential proper part of y, and y is identical to z, then x must also be a tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: TPP(x,z)
