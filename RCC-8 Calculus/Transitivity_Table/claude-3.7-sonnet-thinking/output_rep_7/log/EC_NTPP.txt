PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

I need to determine what are the possible relationships between x and z given that EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let's think about what these relations mean:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts. So they are externally connected.

2. NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and does not touch z's boundary. This means y is completely contained within the interior of z.

Now I need to determine what are the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z. Let's consider all possibilities:

1. DC(x,z): Can x and z be disconnected? Given that EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), we know that x touches y's boundary, and y is completely contained in z's interior. Since y is contained in z, and x touches y, it seems like x must also have some relationship with z. So this could be possible if x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't extend into z at all.

2. EC(x,z): Can x and z be externally connected? This means x and z would touch at their boundaries. Given that y is completely in the interior of z (doesn't touch z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, it's possible that x could also touch z's boundary. So EC(x,z) seems possible.

3. PO(x,z): Can x and z partially overlap? This means x and z share some interior points, but neither is contained in the other. Given that x touches y's boundary and y is contained in z, it's possible that x extends into z, creating a partial overlap. So PO(x,z) seems possible.

4. TPP(x,z): Can x be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. Given that x touches y's boundary and y is contained in z without touching z's boundary, it's not immediately clear if x can be fully contained in z. Let me think... If x is contained in z and touches z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, and y is completely in the interior of z, then this arrangement seems geometrically possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Can x be a non-tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is completely contained in the interior of z. Given that x touches y's boundary and y is in the interior of z, it's possible that x is also completely in the interior of z. So NTPP(x,z) seems possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): Can z be a tangential proper part of x? This would mean z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is contained in z, and x only touches y's boundary, it seems unlikely that z could be contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) seems impossible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Can z be a non-tangential proper part of x? Similar to the previous case, this seems impossible.

8. EQ(x,z): Can x and z be equal? Given that y is a proper part of z, and x is external to y, it's not possible for x and z to be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is impossible.

Let me reconsider by focusing on the spatial arrangement:

We know that y is completely contained within z, not touching z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)).
We also know that x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y (EC(x,y)).

So x touches y from the outside, and y is strictly inside z. 

Let's think about the possible arrangements of x in relation to z:

1. x could be completely outside z, only touching y at a point where y doesn't touch z (since y doesn't touch z's boundary). In this case, x would also be outside z, making DC(x,z) a possibility.

2. x could touch both y's boundary and z's boundary. In this case, EC(x,z) would hold.

3. x could partially extend into z while also having parts outside z. In this case, PO(x,z) would hold.

4. x could be completely inside z and touch z's boundary. In this case, TPP(x,z) would hold.

5. x could be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. In this case, NTPP(x,z) would hold.

Actually, let me think more carefully about DC(x,z). If y is completely in the interior of z, and x touches y's boundary, then x must at least touch z or overlap with it. It can't be disconnected from z because y is inside z, and x touches y. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- EC(x,z)
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me think through this one more time. Maybe I'm missing something. 

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

First, let's check DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. But since x touches y, and y is inside z, x must have some connection with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z): This means x and z touch at their boundaries. Since y is inside z (not touching z's boundary), and x touches y's boundary, x must penetrate into z to touch y. But if x goes into z to touch y, then x and z would share interior points, not just boundary points. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, let me re-examine this more carefully. The relationship EC(x,y) tells us that x touches y at the boundary. And NTPP(y,z) tells us that y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary. If x just touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, then x has to go inside z to touch y. This means x and z share interior points, which is characteristic of PO, TPP, or NTPP.

Now, is TPP(x,z) possible? TPP(x,z) means x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But given that x touches y, and y is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, if x is inside z and touches z's boundary, it can still touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

Is NTPP(x,z) possible? NTPP(x,z) means x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, it can still touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Is PO(x,z) possible? PO(x,z) means x and z overlap, but neither is completely inside the other. If x touches y's boundary and extends outside of z, then PO(x,z) would hold. This seems possible.

So based on my re-examination, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me re-examine EC(x,z) one more time.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch only at their boundaries. For this to be true, x should touch z's boundary and not penetrate into z's interior. But given that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, x must penetrate into z to touch y. So x and z would share interior points, which contradicts EC(x,z). Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, but I need to be careful. Maybe x could touch z's boundary at one point and extend inside z just enough to touch y's boundary at another point. In this case, EC(x,z) wouldn't be accurate because x would have parts inside z, sharing interior points with z.

Actually, I think my reasoning is incorrect. Let me reconsider from the beginning.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x would touch z only at the boundary. But since y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y, x must have parts inside z. This means x and z share interior points, which contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

For DC(x,z) to be true, x would be completely disconnected from z. But since y is inside z and x touches y, x has a connection with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z would overlap, but neither would be contained in the other. If x touches y and extends outside of z, this would be the case. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x would be inside z and touch z's boundary. If x touches y inside z and also touches z's boundary, this would be the case. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x would be completely inside z without touching z's boundary. If x touches y inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary, this would be the case. So NTPP(x,z) is possible.

For TPPi(x,z) to be true, z would be inside x and touch x's boundary. This would contradict NTPP(y,z) because if z is inside x, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then y would be inside x without touching x's boundary, which contradicts EC(x,y). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z) to be true, z would be completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This would also contradict EC(x,y) for similar reasons as above. So NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For EQ(x,z) to be true, x and z would be the same region. But given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), this is not possible. If x and z were the same, then y would be inside x, which contradicts EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me check if my reasoning for EC(x,z) is correct. 

EC(x,z) means x and z touch only at their boundaries. We know that y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. We also know that x touches y's boundary. 

If x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z without touching z's boundary, then x has to penetrate into z to touch y. This means x has interior points inside z, which contradicts EC(x,z). For EC(x,z) to be true, x and z would only touch at their boundaries, with no interior overlap. But since x has to go inside z to touch y, EC(x,z) is not possible.

So my conclusion stands: the possible relationships between x and z are PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me double-check this answer using a simple example. Imagine:
- y is a small circle completely inside a larger circle z.
- x is a shape that touches y's boundary.

For x to touch y, it has to be inside z. Now, x can either:
1. Extend outside of z, leading to a partial overlap (PO).
2. Be completely inside z but touch z's boundary (TPP).
3. Be completely inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP).

These are indeed the three possibilities I've identified.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let me just double-check once more that EC(x,z) is not possible.

If EC(x,z) is true, then x and z touch only at their boundaries, with no interior overlap. But given that y is inside z without touching z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, x must have interior points inside z. This contradicts EC(x,z). So EC(x,z) is not possible.

So, again, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let me check DC(x,z) one more time. If DC(x,z), then x and z are disconnected, with no touching or overlap. If y is inside z, and x touches y, then x must have some contact with z, either by overlapping or touching. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

So indeed, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Oh wait. I think there's a another perspective. Let me see if I'm being too restrictive.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider a geometric view:

We have y completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.
We have x touching y at their boundary.

Now, for x to touch y, it has to reach y's boundary. Since y is inside z, x has to extend into z. However, this doesn't mean x has to have interior points inside z. X could just reach into z to touch y's boundary.

Actually, I'm getting confused because I'm not being precise enough about what it means for x to touch y at their boundary. Let's be more explicit.

For EC(x,y) to be true, x and y touch at their boundaries, meaning there's a point (or points) common to both the boundary of x and the boundary of y, but there are no interior points common to both x and y.

For NTPP(y,z) to be true, y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary, meaning all points of y (both boundary and interior) are interior points of z.

Given these, if x touches y at their boundary, then x touches an interior point of z (since all points of y, including its boundary, are interior points of z). This means x and z share an interior point, which rules out both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

OK let me try one more time. Let's use the definitions and infer:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries. This means they share boundary points but no interior points.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means all of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z.

From (2), we know that y's boundary is in the interior of z. From (1), we know that x touches y's boundary. Combining these, we know that x touches an interior part of z. This means x and z share points, ruling out DC(x,z).

Since x touches an interior part of z, it's not just touching z's boundary. So, EC(x,z) is also ruled out.

For TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z), these would require z to be a part of x or equal to x. But given that y is a proper part of z and x doesn't even overlap with y (only touches its boundary), it's impossible for z to be contained in or equal to x. So, these three are ruled out.

This leaves us with:
- PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap.
- TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z.
- NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

These are the possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, I realize the confusion here. Let's see if I can resolve it.

For EC(x,y), x and y share boundary points but no interior points. For NTPP(y,z), all of y (including its boundary) is in the interior of z. Since x touches y's boundary, and y's boundary is in the interior of z, x touches an interior point of z. This means x penetrates into the interior of z, ruling out both DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

For PO(x,z), x and z overlap, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if x touches y's boundary from inside z and also extends outside of z.

For TPP(x,z), x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y's boundary from inside z and also touches z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z), x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y's boundary from inside z but doesn't touch z's boundary.

For TPPi(x,z), z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary, this isn't possible.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This also isn't possible for similar reasons.

For EQ(x,z), x and z are the same region. This isn't possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y's boundary, so x can't be the same as z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I'm pretty confident in this answer, but let me just check if DC(x,z) can happen one more time.

If DC(x,z), then x and z are disconnected, with no touching or overlap. But given that y is inside z and x touches y, x must have some contact with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

And for EC(x,z), I just realized I've been inconsistent in my reasoning:

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries with no interior overlap. For this to be possible, x must touch the boundary of z. But given that y is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, x must penetrate into the interior of z to touch y. This means x and z share interior points, which contradicts EC(x,z). So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

I'm now confident that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Again, I think this is the correct answer.

Actually, I just realized that I may be misrepresenting the spatial arrangement given EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z).

Let's think of it this way:
- y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary.
- x touches y only at the boundary.

For x to touch y at the boundary, x must reach into z at least at one point. But this doesn't mean x is entirely inside z.

If x extends outside of z, then PO(x,z) is true.
If x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, then TPP(x,z) is true.
If x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is true.

I'm satisfied with this conclusion, and I'm confident in my answer.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to analyze the constraints given:

1. EC(x,y) means x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points.
2. NTPP(y,z) means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (all of y, including its boundary, is in the interior of z).

Let me determine what relationships are possible between x and z:

First, consider that since y's boundary is entirely in the interior of z (from NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y's boundary (from EC(x,y)), x must intersect with the interior of z. This immediately rules out:
- DC(x,z) (impossible because x must contact z)
- EC(x,z) (impossible because x penetrates z's interior)

Also, given that y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y's boundary:
- TPPi(x,z), NTPPi(x,z), and EQ(x,z) are all impossible because these would require z to be contained in or equal to x

This leaves three possible relationships:

1. PO(x,z): x partially overlaps z (x extends into z to touch y, but also has parts outside z)
2. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary)
3. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z (x is completely inside z without touching z's boundary)

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
