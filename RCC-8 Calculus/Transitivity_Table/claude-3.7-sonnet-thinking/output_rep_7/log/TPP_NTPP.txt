PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through what we know:
1. TPP(x,y) means that x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z) means that y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

So we have x is part of y, and y is part of z. Let's figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

First, it's clear that x is part of z, because spatial parthood is transitive. If x is part of y, and y is part of z, then x is part of z.

But what kind of part is x of z? There are two possibilities:
1. TPP(x,z): x is part of z and touches z's boundary.
2. NTPP(x,z): x is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Let's see which one is possible:

We know that x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)), and y does not touch z's boundary (from NTPP(y,z)). 

Since y does not touch z's boundary, and x is fully contained within y, it's not possible for x to touch z's boundary. 

Therefore, x must not touch z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. 

We know:
1. TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
2. NTPP(y,z): y is part of z and does not touch z's boundary.

Let's reason through this:
- x is part of y
- y is part of z
- Therefore, x is part of z

Now, does x touch z's boundary?
- We know that x touches y's boundary
- And y does not touch z's boundary

This means that y is fully contained in the interior of z. Since x touches the boundary of y, but y is fully contained in the interior of z, this means that x does not touch the boundary of z.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Let me double-check this by considering a concrete example:
- Let's say z is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle fully contained within z, not touching z's boundary
- x is a small circle that touches y's boundary and is contained within y

In this scenario:
- TPP(x,y) holds: x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z) holds: y is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary
- And we can see that NTPP(x,z) holds: x is part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary

So my conclusion is that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship between x and z.

Actually, let me do one more check by considering the definition of these relations more carefully:

TPP(x,y) means:
1. x is a proper part of y (all of x is in y, but not all of y is in x)
2. x touches y's boundary (there is at least one point of x that is on the boundary of y)

NTPP(y,z) means:
1. y is a proper part of z (all of y is in z, but not all of z is in y)
2. y does not touch z's boundary (no point of y is on the boundary of z)

So, we have:
- x is a proper part of y
- y is a proper part of z
- x touches y's boundary
- y does not touch z's boundary

Now, what is the relationship between x and z?

First, by transitivity of proper parthood, x is a proper part of z.

Second, does x touch z's boundary? Since y does not touch z's boundary, and x is contained within y, x cannot touch z's boundary either.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider more carefully.

We have:
- TPP(x,y): x is a proper part of y and touches y's boundary
- NTPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and doesn't touch z's boundary

The question is: what's the relationship between x and z?

First, by transitivity of proper parthood, x is a proper part of z.

Now, does x touch z's boundary? Let's think about this carefully:
- y is completely inside z, not touching z's boundary
- x touches y's boundary
- But this doesn't tell us whether x touches z's boundary

Let me try to visualize this with examples:

Example 1:
- z is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle completely inside z, not touching z's boundary
- x is a small circle that touches y's boundary from the inside
- In this case, x doesn't touch z's boundary, so NTPP(x,z)

Example 2:
- z is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle completely inside z, not touching z's boundary
- x is a small circle that is mostly inside y, but extends slightly beyond y's boundary while still remaining within z
- In this case, x could potentially touch z's boundary, so TPP(x,z) would be possible

Wait, but this second example doesn't satisfy TPP(x,y) because x isn't fully contained in y. So that's not a valid counterexample.

Let me reconsider:

If TPP(x,y), then x is fully contained within y and touches y's boundary.
If NTPP(y,z), then y is fully contained within z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Since y is fully contained within the interior of z, and x is fully contained within y, x must also be fully contained within the interior of z, meaning x doesn't touch z's boundary.

Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let me try to be more precise:

1. TPP(x,y) means:
   - x is a proper part of y
   - x touches y's boundary

2. NTPP(y,z) means:
   - y is a proper part of z
   - y doesn't touch z's boundary (y is in the interior of z)

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

Clearly, x is a proper part of z (by transitivity).

The question is whether x touches z's boundary.

Since NTPP(y,z), y is completely in the interior of z, away from z's boundary.
Since TPP(x,y), x is completely within y, though it touches y's boundary.

But since y is completely in the interior of z, and x is completely within y, x must also be completely in the interior of z, away from z's boundary.

Therefore, x doesn't touch z's boundary, which means NTPP(x,z).

To be 100% certain, let me consider one more concrete example:

Imagine:
- z is a large circle
- y is a smaller circle fully contained within the interior of z, not touching z's boundary
- x is an even smaller circle that is fully contained within y, but touches y's boundary at one point

In this scenario:
- TPP(x,y) holds
- NTPP(y,z) holds
- And clearly, NTPP(x,z) holds, as x is contained within the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary

I've convinced myself that NTPP(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what happens when:
- x is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(x,y))
- y is a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(y,z))

Analyzing the implications:

1) First, since x is part of y (from TPP(x,y)), and y is part of z (from NTPP(y,z)), by transitivity, x must be part of z.

2) Next, I need to determine if x touches z's boundary:
   - TPP(x,y) means x touches y's boundary
   - NTPP(y,z) means y is completely in the interior of z and doesn't touch z's boundary
   - Since y doesn't touch z's boundary and x is contained within y, x cannot reach z's boundary

3) Since x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary, the relationship must be NTPP(x,z).

### Answer: NTPP(x,z)
