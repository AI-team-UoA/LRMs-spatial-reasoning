PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step.

We know that:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected, meaning they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- EQ(y,z): y and z are equal or coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.

Given that y and z are equal (EQ(y,z)), they must have the same spatial relationships with other regions. So if x is externally connected to y (EC(x,y)), then x must also be externally connected to z.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be EC(x,z).

Let me double-check this reasoning:

If EQ(y,z), then y and z are the same region in space. This means that any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. Since EC(x,y), we must have EC(x,z).

So the answer is: EC(x,z).

Actually, let me be more careful here. The EQ relation means that y and z are spatially identical. This means that z has exactly the same spatial properties as y. So if x is externally connected to y, then x must also be externally connected to z, since z is spatially identical to y.

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is EC(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z given:
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected (touch at boundaries but don't share interior)
- EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident (spatially identical)

Since y and z occupy exactly the same space (they are identical regions), any spatial relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z. 

Since x is externally connected to y, and z is identical to y, then x must also be externally connected to z.

### Answer: EC(x,z)
