PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap. They share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means that y is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z.

Now we need to figure out what the relationship between x and z could be.

Since PO(x,y), we know that x and y share some spatial part, but x also has parts outside of y, and y has parts outside of x.

Since TPP(y,z), we know that y is completely contained within z, touching z's boundary.

What does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

Well, x has some parts that overlap with y, and y is completely inside z. So those parts of x that overlap with y must also be inside z. But x also has parts outside of y. Those parts could be:
1. Inside z but not overlapping with y
2. Outside z entirely
3. Partially inside and partially outside z

Let's consider all the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   This is not possible because x overlaps with y, and y is inside z. So x and z must share at least some spatial part.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
   This could be possible if all parts of x that overlap with y touch the boundary of y, and y touches the boundary of z at those same points. So x could touch z at the boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   This is definitely possible. The parts of x that overlap with y are inside z, but x could have other parts outside z.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z. Since y touches the boundary of z and x overlaps with y, if the rest of x is all inside z and x touches the boundary of z (possibly at the same points where y touches z), then TPP(x,z) holds.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   This is possible if all of x is inside z, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z. If the parts of x that overlap with y don't reach the boundary of z, and the rest of x is also inside z, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   This would mean z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. But we know y is inside z, and x overlaps with y. This implies that z has parts that are not in x (specifically, parts of z that are not part of y and don't overlap with x). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPPi, this is not possible because z must have parts that are not in x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This is not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x overlaps with y but is not equal to y. So x and z can't be equal.

I'm not completely sure about some of these, so let me reason through the problematic cases more carefully:

For EC(x,z), I initially thought it might be possible, but actually, it's not. If PO(x,y), then x and y share some interior points. Those shared points must be inside z (since y is inside z). So x and z must share some interior points, which means they can't be merely externally connected (EC).

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), I think my initial reasoning was correct. These are not possible because z must have parts that are not in x.

I need to be more careful about TPP(x,z) as well. TPP(x,z) means that all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z. Given that PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), can all of x be inside z? Well, the parts of x that overlap with y are inside z. The parts of x that don't overlap with y could potentially be outside z. If all of x happens to be inside z, and x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) holds.

Let me rethink what the possible relationships are:

1. DC(x,z): Not possible, as explained earlier.
2. EC(x,z): Not possible, as explained above.
3. PO(x,z): Possible. The parts of x that overlap with y are inside z, but x could have other parts outside z.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible. If all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) holds.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible. If all of x is inside z, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) holds.
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible, as explained earlier.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible, as explained earlier.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible, as explained earlier.

Actually, I want to double-check my reasoning about the relationships TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). 

For TPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be a tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and touches the boundary of x. But we know that y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y is completely inside z. Given that x partially overlaps with y, there are parts of y that are not in x. But all of y is in z, so there must be parts of z that are not in x. Therefore, z cannot be a proper part of x, so TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, for NTPPi(x,z) to hold, z must be a non-tangential proper part of x. This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x. But again, given that y is a proper part of z and x partially overlaps with y, there must be parts of z that are not in x. Therefore, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

So, my final list of possible relationships between x and z is:
1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

Actually, I think I should draw some diagrams to be more thorough.

Scenario 1: PO(x,z)
x partially overlaps with y, and y is a tangential proper part of z. Some parts of x are outside of z.

Scenario 2: TPP(x,z)
x partially overlaps with y, and y is a tangential proper part of z. All of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z.

Scenario 3: NTPP(x,z)
x partially overlaps with y, and y is a tangential proper part of z. All of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z.

Hmm, I need to be careful about scenario 2 (TPP(x,z)). TPP(x,z) means that x is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z. We know that y is a tangential proper part of z, which means y touches the boundary of z. Given that x partially overlaps with y, some parts of x are in y and some are not. If all parts of x that are not in y are still inside z, and x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z) holds.

On second thought, let me redo this analysis with a clearer picture.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x and y share some spatial part, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and touches the boundary of z.

Let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   For this to be true, x must be completely outside of z. But since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, at least some part of x is inside z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
   For this to be true, x must be outside of z but touch z at the boundary. But again, since x overlaps with y, and y is inside z, some part of x is inside z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   If some part of x is inside z (which we know is true because x overlaps with y, and y is inside z), and some part of x is outside z, then PO(x,z) holds. This is definitely a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, all of x must be inside z, and x must touch the boundary of z. Is this possible given our constraints? Yes, it is. If all parts of x that don't overlap with y are still inside z, and x touches the boundary of z (which is possible because y touches the boundary of z, and x overlaps with y), then TPP(x,z) holds.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   For this to be true, all of x must be inside z, and x must not touch the boundary of z. Is this possible? Yes, it is. If all parts of x (including those that don't overlap with y) are inside z, and none of the parts of x that overlap with y touch the boundary of z where y touches the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   For this to be true, all of z must be inside x, and z must touch the boundary of x. But we know that y is inside z, and x only partially overlaps with y. This means there are parts of y (and therefore parts of z) that are not inside x. So z is not a proper part of x, and TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPPi, this is not possible because there are parts of z that are not inside x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   This is not possible because y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y. So x and z can't be equal.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

But I'm not 100% sure about NTPP(x,z). Let's check this more carefully.

NTPP(x,z) means that x is completely inside z and doesn't touch the boundary of z. We know that y touches the boundary of z (since TPP(y,z)). Does that mean that x must also touch the boundary of z? Not necessarily. 

Consider a case where y touches the boundary of z, but the parts of x that overlap with y don't include the parts of y that touch the boundary of z. In this case, x could be completely inside z without touching the boundary, which would make NTPP(x,z) a valid relationship.

So, I believe the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

I think I'm over-complicating this. Let me try a more straightforward approach.

Let's recall the constraints:
- PO(x,y): x partially overlaps with y.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z.

Now, let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - x and z are disconnected.
   Can x be completely outside of z? No, because x overlaps with y, and y is inside z. So some part of x must be inside z. Thus, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - x and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap.
   Can x be outside of z, but touch z at the boundary? No, because x overlaps with y, and y is inside z. So some part of x must be inside z, not just touching at the boundary. Thus, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
   Can some part of x be inside z and some part of x be outside z? Yes, this is possible. The parts of x that overlap with y are inside z, but x could have other parts outside z. Thus, PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
   Can all of x be inside z, and x touch the boundary of z? Yes, this is possible. If all parts of x (including those that don't overlap with y) are inside z, and x touches the boundary of z (which is possible because y touches the boundary of z, and x overlaps with y), then TPP(x,z) holds.

5. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.
   Can all of x be inside z, and x not touch the boundary of z? Yes, this is possible. If all parts of x are inside z, and none of those parts touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z) holds.

6. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x.
   Can all of z be inside x, and z touch the boundary of x? No, this is not possible. Since y is inside z, and x only partially overlaps with y, there must be parts of z that are not inside x. Thus, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x.
   Similar to TPPi, this is not possible because there must be parts of z that are not inside x.

8. EQ(x,z) - x and z are equal.
   Can x and z be the same region? No, because y is a proper part of z, and x only partially overlaps with y. So x and z can't be equal.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

This confirms our earlier conclusion.

Actually, I just realized a way to visualize this problem more easily. Let me try a slightly different approach.

We have:
- PO(x,y): x partially overlaps with y. This means:
  * Some part of x is inside y.
  * Some part of x is outside y.
  * Some part of y is outside x.

- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means:
  * All of y is inside z.
  * y touches the boundary of z.

From these constraints, we know:
- The part of x that is inside y is also inside z.
- The part of x that is outside y could be inside or outside z.

Let's enumerate the possibilities:
1. If all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z).
2. If all of x is inside z, and x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z).
3. If some part of x is inside z and some part of x is outside z, then PO(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

This is consistent with our previous conclusion.

Let me cross-check this one more time from a different angle.

Given:
- PO(x,y): x partially overlaps with y. This means x and y share some interior points, but neither is fully contained in the other.
- TPP(y,z): y is a tangential proper part of z. This means y is fully contained in z and touches the boundary of z.

Let's analyze the relationship between x and z based on these constraints:

The part of x that overlaps with y is inside z (since y is inside z). But the part of x that is outside y could be:
1. Entirely inside z. Then, depending on whether x touches the boundary of z, we have:
   a. If x touches the boundary of z, then TPP(x,z).
   b. If x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then NTPP(x,z).
2. Partially or entirely outside z. Then PO(x,z).

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

I am confident that these are the only possible relationships.

So, if PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are:
1. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap.
2. TPP(x,z) - x is a tangential proper part of z.
3. NTPP(x,z) - x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z given PO(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

Let me analyze this systematically:

1) From PO(x,y), we know:
   - x and y share some interior points
   - Some part of x is outside y
   - Some part of y is outside x

2) From TPP(y,z), we know:
   - y is completely contained within z
   - y touches the boundary of z

Given these constraints, I can determine:
- The part of x that overlaps with y must be inside z (since y is inside z)
- The part of x that is outside y could be either inside or outside z

This gives us three possible relationships:

1. PO(x,z): If some part of x extends outside of z, then x and z partially overlap.

2. TPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z, and x touches the boundary of z, then x is a tangential proper part of z.

3. NTPP(x,z): If all of x is inside z, but x doesn't touch the boundary of z, then x is a non-tangential proper part of z.

### Answer: PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
