PROMPT: If PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's carefully think about this problem.

We're given two pieces of information:
1. PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other
2. EQ(y,z): y and z are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space

Now we need to determine the possible relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(y,z), y and z are exactly the same in terms of spatial extent. This means that z has exactly the same spatial relationship with x as y does.

Given that PO(x,y), we know that x and y partially overlap - they share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Since z is identical to y (EQ(y,z)), z must also have the same relationship with x.

Therefore, x and z must be in a partial overlap relationship: PO(x,z).

Let me double-check this by considering the definition again:

PO(x,y) means that x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).

If y and z occupy exactly the same space, then any relationship that holds between x and y must also hold between x and z.

Therefore, if PO(x,y), then PO(x,z).

So the answer is: PO(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relationship between x and z given that PO(x,y) and EQ(y,z).

PO(x,y) means x and y share some spatial part, but neither is completely contained within the other.

EQ(y,z) means that y and z are coincident - they occupy exactly the same space and have identical boundaries.

Since y and z are exactly the same spatial region (EQ(y,z)), z must have the identical spatial relationship with x as y does. 

Therefore, if x partially overlaps with y, and y is equal to z, then x must also partially overlap with z.

### Answer: PO(x,z)
