PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think about the information we have. We know that:
- TPPi(x,y), which means that y is a tangential proper part of x. In other words, y is inside x, touching x's boundary.
- EC(y,z), which means that y and z touch at their boundaries, but don't share any interior parts.

Now let's think about the possible relationships between x and z.

1. DC(x,z) - This would mean that x and z are disconnected. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, it's possible that z is entirely outside of x and only touches y at the point where y touches x's boundary. So this is a possible relationship.

2. EC(x,z) - This would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, it's possible that z touches x exactly at the boundary point where y touches x. So this is a possible relationship.

3. PO(x,z) - This would mean that x and z partially overlap, sharing some interior parts but not completely containing each other. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, it's possible that z extends partly inside x and partly outside x, with the touching point of y and z being at the boundary of x. So this is a possible relationship.

4. TPP(x,z) - This would mean that x is a tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is inside z and touches z's boundary. However, this doesn't seem consistent with our given information. If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, then z must touch or be outside x; it can't contain x. So this is not a possible relationship.

5. NTPP(x,z) - This would mean that x is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Similarly to the above, this doesn't seem consistent with our given information. So this is not a possible relationship.

6. TPPi(x,z) - This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, it's possible that z is inside x and touches x's boundary at the same point where y touches it. So this is a possible relationship.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - This would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Given that y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, it's possible that z is completely inside x but only touches y at a point that's not on x's boundary. So this is a possible relationship.

8. EQ(x,z) - This would mean that x and z are the same region. However, if y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary, then z must be different from x. So this is not a possible relationship.

Hmm, let me think a bit more carefully. 

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. That is, y is inside x, and y touches the boundary of x at some point. 

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. 

So, y is inside x, touching x's boundary, and z touches y's boundary. 

Let's consider each case more carefully. Let's call the point where y touches x's boundary as point p.

1. DC(x,z): z is disconnected from x. This means z is outside of x and doesn't touch x. Since y touches x's boundary at point p, and z touches y's boundary, z must touch x at point p as well, which contradicts z being disconnected from x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, wait. Let's reconsider. TPPi(x,y) means that y is inside x and touches x's boundary at some point p. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries. But does it mean that z touches y at point p? Not necessarily. z could touch y at another boundary point of y, which is not point p. In that case, z could still be disconnected from x.

But then I realize I'm falling into a more detailed level of representation, where I'm considering individual points. In the context of the RCC-8 calculus, we're dealing with regions, not points. A region, by definition, must have an interior; it can't be just a point. So even if z touches y at a point different from p, z must still have an interior. 

Let me reconsider again. TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, i.e., y is inside x and touches x's boundary. EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries. 

In 2D (or higher dimensions), if y touches x's boundary, it means there's a part of y's boundary that coincides with a part of x's boundary. And if z touches y's boundary, there's a part of z's boundary that coincides with a part of y's boundary. 

If z touches y at a part of y's boundary that coincides with x's boundary, then z would also touch x's boundary, which means EC(x,z).

If z touches y at a part of y's boundary that is inside x, then z would be partly inside x. If the part of z inside x doesn't touch x's boundary, then PO(x,z). If the part of z inside x touches x's boundary, then PO(x,z) or TPPi(x,z).

If z touches y at a part of y's boundary that is inside x, and z is completely inside x, then TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z), depending on whether z touches x's boundary.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But I should reconsider DC(x,z) as well, because there's a subtle case I've been missing: if y touches x's boundary at some point p, and z touches y's boundary at a different point q that's not on x's boundary, then z could still be disconnected from x.

Actually, let me reconsider once more. We're dealing with RCC-8, which assumes a Closed Set Topology. In such a topology, regions are not only close under arbitrary unions, but also under arbitrary intersections. This means that the boundary points of a region are part of the region. 

Given TPPi(x,y), y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is inside x and touches x's boundary. Importantly, the points where y touches x's boundary are part of both y and x.

Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at their boundaries. The points where y and z touch are part of both y and z.

So, if y touches x's boundary at some points, and z touches y's boundary at some points, there are two possibilities: either z touches y at a point where y touches x, or z touches y at a different point.

If z touches y at a point where y touches x, then that point is part of x, y, and z. This means x and z share at least one point, which means they are not disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible in this case.

If z touches y at a point where y doesn't touch x, that point is inside x. This again means that x and z share at least one point, so DC(x,z) is not possible.

Hmm, actually I'm confusing myself. Let me try to visualize the situation more concretely.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So y is properly contained in x, and at least one point of y is also on the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z touch at their boundaries but don't overlap. 

Now let's try to enumerate the possible spatial configurations for x and z.

I realize that it's not possible for z to be disconnected from x (DC(x,z)). This is because TPPi(x,y) means that y is inside x, and EC(y,z) means that y and z touch. So if y is inside x, and z touches y, then z must at least touch x (EC(x,z)) or overlap with x (PO(x,z)) or be partly or wholly contained in x (TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)).

So the possibilities are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let's verify that these are all possible.

- EC(x,z): This is possible if y touches x's boundary at a point p, and z touches y at the same point p. Then z is outside of x but touches x at point p.

- PO(x,z): This is possible if y touches x's boundary at a point p, and z touches y at a different point q inside x. If z is partly inside x and partly outside, then PO(x,z).

- TPPi(x,z): This is possible if y touches x's boundary at a point p, and z touches y at a different point q inside x. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary (either at p or at another point), then TPPi(x,z).

- NTPPi(x,z): This is possible if y touches x's boundary at a point p, and z touches y at a different point q inside x. If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I realize that I'm missing some cases:

- If y touches x's boundary at a point p, and z touches y at the same point p, then z could still extend into x, leading to PO(x,z) or TPPi(x,z).

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, I'm still uncertain about DC(x,z). Let me try once more with a specific case. Imagine x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle that's inside x and touches x's boundary, and z is another circle outside of x that touches y at the same point where y touches x. In this case, z doesn't share any interior parts with x, but they share a boundary point, which means EC(x,z), not DC(x,z). So indeed, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I feel like the defintion of the RCC-8 relations is still giving me some uncertainty. Let me try to specify more precisely.

RCC-8 relations:
- DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected; they share no points.
- EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected; they share at least one boundary point but no interior points.
- PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some interior points, but each has interior points not in the other.
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y; all of x is in y, and x touches the boundary of y.
- NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y; all of x is in y, and x doesn't touch the boundary of y.
- TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x; all of y is in x, and y touches the boundary of x.
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x; all of y is in x, and y doesn't touch the boundary of x.
- EQ(x,y): x and y are equal; they occupy the same region.

Now, with TPPi(x,y), y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. With EC(y,z), y and z touch at a boundary point but don't share any interior.

If y is inside x and touches x's boundary at a point p, and z touches y at a point q, then there are several cases:

1. If q is the same as p, then z touches x at p as well. This means EC(x,z), PO(x,z), or TPPi(x,z), depending on how z relates to x.

2. If q is different from p and is inside x, then z shares at least one point with x. This means EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z), depending on how z relates to x.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's try this from a different angle. Let's use the composition table for RCC-8. The composition TPPi ○ EC (i.e., what you get when you have TPPi in the first step and EC in the second step) should tell us the possible relationships.

According to the RCC-8 composition table, TPPi ○ EC = DC | EC | PO | TPPi | NTPPi.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I see DC is in there, which contradicts my earlier reasoning. Let me reconsider. 

Actually, I should distinguish between the "strong" (directly implied) and "weak" (inferred from composing the algebraic constraints) interpretation of RCC-8. The composition table provides the weak interpretation, which can include more possibilities than the strong interpretation.

In the context of this question, I think we are asked for the "strong" interpretation, i.e., what's directly implied by the given relationships.

Given TPPi(x,y), y is completely inside x and touches x's boundary at some point p. Given EC(y,z), y and z touch at some boundary point q but don't share interior. 

To determine the possible relationships between x and z, I'll again consider the cases based on the location of point q:

1. If q is the same as p, then q is a boundary point of x, y, and z. Then z touches x at q. If z is completely outside of x except for point q, then EC(x,z). If z extends inside x, then PO(x,z) or TPPi(x,z), depending on whether z is completely inside x.

2. If q is not the same as p, then q is inside x but not on the boundary of x. It's a boundary point of y and z. So z extends inside x. If z extends outside of x as well, then PO(x,z). If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, then TPPi(x,z). If z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, then NTPPi(x,z).

Now, can DC(x,z) be possible? If y is inside x and touches x's boundary, and z touches y, then z shares at least one point with x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider the case of DC(x,z) one more time. 

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. This means y is properly contained in x, and y touches the boundary of x at at least one point.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. This means y and z share at least one boundary point but no interior points.

Now, if y touches the boundary of x at point p, and z touches y at point q, there are indeed two cases: q = p or q ≠ p.

If q = p, then p is a boundary point of x, y, and z. In this case, x and z share the point p, so they are at least externally connected. So DC(x,z) is not possible in this case.

If q ≠ p, then q is a boundary point of y and z, but not of x. If q is inside x (which it must be if y is inside x), then x and z share the point q, so they are at least externally connected. So DC(x,z) is not possible in this case either.

So in all cases, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I realized I might have been misunderstanding the relations. I was thinking of points, but the RCC-8 relations define connection between regions. In RCC-8, two regions are connected if they share at least one point. Two regions are externally connected if they are connected but don't share any interior points. 

So TPPi(x,y) means that y is properly contained in x (i.e., y is a subset of x and not equal to x), and y is connected to the complement of x (i.e., y shares at least one point with the complement of x). In other words, y touches the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are connected (they share at least one point) but don't share any interior points.

Given these interpretations, let me reconsider the possible relations between x and z.

If y touches the boundary of x, and z touches y, then there are indeed two cases: z touches y at a point where y touches the boundary of x, or z touches y at a different point.

In the first case, z also touches the boundary of x, so EC(x,z), PO(x,z), or TPPi(x,z) is possible, depending on how z relates to x.

In the second case, z touches y at a point inside x. So x and z share at least one point. Depending on how z relates to x, EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm overthinking this. I should trust the composition table for RCC-8, which says that TPPi ○ EC = DC | EC | PO | TPPi | NTPPi.

Let me construct specific examples for each of these:

1. DC(x,z): x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary, and z is a circle outside of x and not touching x. Wait, but if z is outside of x and not touching x, how can it touch y, which is inside x? I think DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary at point p, and z is a circle outside of x but touching x at point p. Here, y and z touch at point p, and they don't share interior. This satisfies our conditions.

3. PO(x,z): x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary at point p, and z is a circle that overlaps with x, with part of z inside x and part outside. If z touches y at a point, this satisfies our conditions.

4. TPPi(x,z): x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary at point p, and z is an even smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary at point q, with z also touching y at a point. This satisfies our conditions.

5. NTPPi(x,z): x is a large circle, y is a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary at point p, and z is an even smaller circle completely inside x and not touching x's boundary, with z touching y at a point. This satisfies our conditions.

So it seems like all of DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi are possible. But I'm still unsure about DC. Let me think about that case again.

Actually, wait. For DC(x,z) to be possible, z must be disconnected from x, which means they don't share any points. But we know that y is inside x, and z touches y. So z and x must share at least one point, which means they can't be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I think I'm complicating the issue because of the involvement of boundaries. Let me try to reduce the problem to simpler terms.

The interiors of x, y, and z are non-empty, open sets. Their boundaries are the respective closures minus the interiors.

TPPi(x,y) means that:
- The interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x.
- The boundary of y intersects the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means that:
- The interior of y doesn't intersect the interior of z.
- The boundary of y intersects the boundary of z.

So the interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the boundary of y intersects the boundary of x and the boundary of z. Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

If the interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the interior of y doesn't intersect the interior of z, then the interior of z could be:
- Completely outside of x: in this case, the boundaries of x and z must intersect if the boundaries of y and z intersect, which means EC(x,z).
- Partly inside and partly outside of x: in this case, PO(x,z).
- Completely inside x and touches the boundary of x: in this case, TPPi(x,z).
- Completely inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x: in this case, NTPPi(x,z).

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I'm still unsure about DC(x,z).

Actually, I missed a subtlety. EC(y,z) means that y and z don't share interior points, but their boundaries touch. The point where their boundaries touch could be on the boundary of x (if y touches x's boundary at that point), or it could be in the interior of x (if y touches x's boundary at a different point).

In the first case, z touches the boundary of x as well, so DC(x,z) is not possible. In the second case, z touches a point in the interior of x, so again DC(x,z) is not possible.

So in all cases, DC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, one more check: is EQ(x,z) possible? If y is a proper part of x, and z touches y but doesn't overlap with it, then z cannot be equal to x. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, I'm still unsure about DC(x,z). Let me try a different tack.

Let's consider the RCC-8 relations in terms of point sets and the subset relationship.

Given two regions x and y in a topological space, we define the interior of a region as the largest open set contained in the region, and the boundary of a region as the region's closure minus its interior.

RCC-8 relations can be defined as follows:
- DC(x,y): The closures of x and y are disjoint.
- EC(x,y): The closures of x and y intersect, but their interiors are disjoint.
- PO(x,y): The interiors of x and y intersect, and each has interior points not in the other.
- TPP(x,y): The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, and the closures of x and y intersect.
- NTPP(x,y): The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, and the closures of x and y don't intersect.
- TPPi(x,y): TPP(y,x).
- NTPPi(x,y): NTPP(y,x).
- EQ(x,y): The interiors of x and y are equal.

Now, TPPi(x,y) means that the interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the closures of x and y intersect. EC(y,z) means that the closures of y and z intersect, but their interiors are disjoint.

So we have:
- The interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x.
- The closures of x and y intersect.
- The closures of y and z intersect.
- The interiors of y and z are disjoint.

What does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

If the interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the interiors of y and z are disjoint, then the interior of z could intersect with the interior of x (PO, TPPi, NTPPi) or not (DC, EC).

But we also know that the closures of y and z intersect. So y and z share at least one point p. This point p must be in the closure of y, which means it's either in the interior of y or on the boundary of y. But since the interiors of y and z are disjoint, p must be on the boundary of y.

Now, is p also on the boundary of x? It could be, or it could be in the interior of x. If p is on the boundary of x, then the closures of x and z intersect, which means DC(x,z) is not possible, but EC(x,z) is possible. If p is in the interior of x, then p is in the closure of x as well, so again the closures of x and z intersect, and DC(x,z) is not possible.

So I'm still sure that DC(x,z) is not possible. And yes, after double-checking I still think the composition table for RCC-8 which says that TPPi ○ EC = DC | EC | PO | TPPi | NTPPi is incorrect when it suggests DC is a possibility. The correction I would make is that TPPi ○ EC = EC | PO | TPPi | NTPPi.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I need to be careful. I might be misunderstanding or misapplying the composition. Let me try to find the right definition online.

Actually, I might have been confused about the composition. Let me clarify.

Given three regions x, y, and z, the composition of relations R1(x,y) and R2(y,z) is the set of all possible relations R3(x,z) such that R1(x,y) and R2(y,z) can hold simultaneously.

So TPPi ○ EC is the set of all possible relations between x and z such that TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z) can hold simultaneously.

According to the RCC-8 composition table, TPPi ○ EC = DC | EC | PO | TPPi | NTPPi.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Hmm, let's try once more. 

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x. So the interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the boundary of y intersects the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected. So the interiors of y and z are disjoint, but their boundaries intersect.

Now, let's consider the case where DC(x,z) is true. This means the closures of x and z are disjoint.

But we know that the boundary of y intersects the boundary of z, so there's at least one point p that's on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z. This point p is in the closure of y, which is a subset of the closure of x. So p is in the closure of x and the closure of z, which means the closures of x and z are not disjoint, contradicting DC(x,z).

So DC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I think part of my confusion is that I'm unsure whether the closure of y being a subset of the closure of x is implied by TPPi(x,y). 

OK, let's go back to the official definitions of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected; they share no points.
2. EC(x,y): x and y are externally connected; they share at least one boundary point but no interior points.
3. PO(x,y): x and y partially overlap; they share some interior points, but each has interior points not in the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y; all of x is in y, x is not equal to y, and x shares at least one boundary point with y.
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y; all of x is in y, x is not equal to y, and x doesn't share any boundary points with y.
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x; inverse of TPP.
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x; inverse of NTPP.
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equal; they occupy the same region.

So TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means all of y is in x, y is not equal to x, and y shares at least one boundary point with x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, which means they share at least one boundary point but no interior points.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z. I'll construct specific examples for each of the possible relations.

- DC(x,z): This means x and z are disconnected, so they share no points. But given that y is inside x and y shares a boundary point with z, z must share a point with x as well. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

- EC(x,z): This means x and z are externally connected, so they share at least one boundary point but no interior points. For example, x could be a large circle, y could be a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary at point p, and z could be a circle outside of x and touching x at point p. This satisfies our conditions.

- PO(x,z): This means x and z partially overlap, so they share some interior points, but each has interior points not in the other. For example, x could be a large circle, y could be a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary at point p, and z could be a circle that overlaps with x, with part of z inside x and part outside, and z touching y at some point. This satisfies our conditions.

- TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, so all of x is in z, x is not equal to z, and x shares at least one boundary point with z. But given that y is inside x, and y shares a boundary point with z, z must share a point with the interior of x. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so all of x is in z, x is not equal to z, and x doesn't share any boundary points with z. But similarly to TPP, given that y is inside x, and y shares a boundary point with z, z must share a point with the interior of x. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

- TPPi(x,z): This means z is a tangential proper part of x, so all of z is in x, z is not equal to x, and z shares at least one boundary point with x. For example, x could be a large circle, y could be a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary at point p, and z could be an even smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary at point p, with z also touching y at some point. This satisfies our conditions.

- NTPPi(x,z): This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, so all of z is in x, z is not equal to x, and z doesn't share any boundary points with x. For example, x could be a large circle, y could be a smaller circle inside x and touching x's boundary at point p, and z could be an even smaller circle completely inside x and not touching x's boundary, with z touching y at some point. This satisfies our conditions.

- EQ(x,z): This means x and z are equal, so they occupy the same region. But given that y is inside x, and y doesn't share interior points with z, y must be inside z as well, but not sharing interior points with z. This is not possible. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, I was thinking about the TPP and NTPP cases incorrectly. Let me reconsider.

- TPP(x,z): This means x is a tangential proper part of z, so all of x is in z, x is not equal to z, and x shares at least one boundary point with z. For example, x could be a large circle, and z could be an even larger circle that completely contains x, with x and z touching at one boundary point. But we also know that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x. Given that y shares a boundary point with z, could this still be possible? If y touches the boundary of x at the same point where x touches the boundary of z, and z also shares this point, then z must contain part of the interior of x, so EC(y,z) cannot hold. But if y touches the boundary of x at a different point, then z must share this point as well, which means z must share a point with the interior of x. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

- NTPP(x,z): This means x is a non-tangential proper part of z, so all of x is in z, x is not equal to z, and x doesn't share any boundary points with z. But given that y is inside x and touches the boundary of x, and y shares a boundary point with z, z must share a point with the interior of x. This means x cannot be a proper part of z. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm overthinking this. The RCC-8 composition table should be a reliable source of truth, and it says that TPPi ○ EC = DC | EC | PO | TPPi | NTPPi.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But I'm still not convinced about DC(x,z). Let me try once more with a specific example.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means all of y is in x, y is not equal to x, and y shares at least one boundary point with x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, which means they share at least one boundary point but no interior points.

Can we construct an example where DC(x,z) holds?

DC(x,z) means that x and z are disconnected, which means they share no points.

So we need all of y to be in x, y to share a boundary point with x, y to share a boundary point with z, but x and z to share no points.

Given that y shares a boundary point with z, and all of y is in x, I would expect that point to be in x as well, which would mean that x and z share a point, contradicting DC(x,z).

Actually, I realized the issue. I'm thinking of points and regions in a Euclidean space, where the boundary of a region consists of points that are part of the region. But in RCC-8, the concept of a boundary is more abstract.

In RCC-8, regions are treated as sets of points, and the boundary of a region is not necessarily part of the region. Two regions can be externally connected if they share boundary points, but those boundary points are not necessarily part of either region.

So when I say "y shares a boundary point with x," what I mean in RCC-8 terms is that there are points that are in the boundary of y and in the boundary of x, but these points may not be part of y or x.

With this understanding, let's reconsider the case of DC(x,z).

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means all of y is in x, y is not equal to x, and there are points that are in the boundary of y and in the boundary of x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, which means there are points that are in the boundary of y and in the boundary of z, but y and z have no points in common.

Can we construct an example where DC(x,z) holds?

Hmm, this is still confusing me. I want to know for sure whether this is possible. Let me try a different approach.

In RCC-8, regions are treated as regular closed sets in a topological space. A set is regular closed if it equals the closure of its interior. The boundary of a region is part of the region in this context.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means all of y is in x, y is not equal to x, and y shares at least one boundary point with x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, which means they share at least one boundary point but no interior points.

If y shares a boundary point p with z, and all of y is in x, then p is in x as well. So x and z share the point p, which means they cannot be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm too fixated. There's an ambiguity in spatial reasoning with the RCC-8 calculus that arises because these are qualitative relationships that generalize over various geometric scenarios. For this particular problem, the RCC-8 composition table says that the possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

The fact that the table includes DC(x,z) implies that there's a situation in RCC-8 where y is a tangential proper part of x, y and z are externally connected, and x and z are disconnected. In some formalizations, especially when considering higher dimensions, this might be possible. But I've just convinced myself this isn't possible in the standard interpretation. 

I'm really torn. My intuition says that DC(x,z) is not possible, since if y is completely inside x, and y shares a boundary point with z, then z must also share that boundary point with x. But let me try to be more precise with definitions.

In the standard interpretation of RCC-8, regions are regular closed sets in a topological space. Two regions are externally connected if their interiors are disjoint but their closures intersect. A region y is a tangential proper part of a region x if the interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the boundaries of x and y intersect.

So, TPPi(x,y) means:
- The interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x.
- The boundaries of x and y intersect.

EC(y,z) means:
- The interiors of y and z are disjoint.
- The boundaries of y and z intersect.

Now, can we construct an example where DC(x,z) holds?

DC(x,z) means:
- The closures of x and z are disjoint.

If the boundaries of y and z intersect, and the interior of y is a subset of the interior of x, then the closure of x contains the boundary of y. So, the closure of x intersects the boundary of z, which means the closures of x and z are not disjoint. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let me sketch a picture:
- x is a large circle.
- y is a smaller circle inside x, touching the boundary of x at point p.
- z is a circle outside of x, touching the boundary of y at point q.

If q is the same as p, then z also touches the boundary of x at point p, so EC(x,z).
If q is different from p, then q is a point inside x, and z contains the point q, so the interiors of x and z intersect, which means PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), or NTPPi(x,z).

In all cases, DC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, maybe I'm incorrect because I misinterpreted the definition for the TPPi relation. Let's check.

The tangential proper part relation TPP(x,y) is traditionally defined as: The interior of x is a proper subset of the interior of y, and the boundaries of x and y intersect.

So TPPi(x,y) means: The interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the boundaries of x and y intersect.

The external connection relation EC(x,y) is traditionally defined as: The interiors of x and y are disjoint, but their boundaries intersect.

So EC(y,z) means: The interiors of y and z are disjoint, but their boundaries intersect.

Can DC(x,z) hold under these conditions? 

The disconnection relation DC(x,z) means: The closures of x and z are disjoint.

If the boundaries of y and z intersect, then there's a point p that's on both the boundary of y and the boundary of z. This point p is in the closure of y, which is a subset of the closure of x. So p is in the closure of x and the closure of z, which means the closures of x and z are not disjoint, contradicting DC(x,z).

So again, I don't think DC(x,z) is possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, since I'm not 100% confident, I'll go with the composition table's result: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, I realized something. I can construct a specific example for the DC(x,z) case. 

Imagine a 3D space with:
- x as a large sphere.
- y as a smaller sphere inside x, touching the boundary of x at point p.
- z as a sphere outside of x, touching y at a different point q that's not p.

Wait, I think there's a problem with this example. If y is completely inside x, and y touches z, then z must share a point with x, which means DC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Let me check the RCC-8 composition table for TPPi ○ EC again:
- DC: No, I can't think of a valid example.
- EC: Yes, z can touch the boundary of x at the same point where y touches the boundary of x.
- PO: Yes, z can partially overlap with x, with part inside and part outside.
- TPP: No, I don't think x can be a tangential proper part of z in this case.
- NTPP: No, I don't think x can be a non-tangential proper part of z in this case.
- TPPi: Yes, z can be a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi: Yes, z can be a non-tangential proper part of x.
- EQ: No, x and z can't be equal in this case.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I'm pretty certain now: the possible relations between x and z, given TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), are EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let's double-check the composition table from a trusted source. According to Randell, Cui, and Cohn (1992), the composition table for RCC-8 does indeed indicate that TPPi ○ EC = DC | EC | PO | TPPi | NTPPi.

So the possible relations between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

But wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try a specific example for the DC case.

Imagine a 3D space with:
- x as a large hollow sphere (just the shell).
- y as a smaller solid sphere inside x, touching the inside of the shell at point p.
- z as a sphere outside of x, touching the outside of the shell at a point that's the antipodal of p.

Wait, in this case, y is not touching z, so EC(y,z) doesn't hold.

I'm really starting to doubt the composition table's inclusion of DC(x,z). Let me try once more.

OK, so we have TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), and we're trying to determine the possible relations between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means all of y is in x, y is not equal to x, and y shares at least one boundary point with x.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, which means they share at least one boundary point but no interior points.

If y shares a boundary point p with z, and all of y is in x, then p is in x as well. So x and z share the point p, which means they cannot be disconnected. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

I've convinced myself: the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I just remembered that there's a formal algebraic way to compute compositions in RCC-8. Let's see:

TPPi(x,y) means that:
- INT(y) ⊂ INT(x)
- y ≠ x
- ∂y ∩ ∂x ≠ ∅

EC(y,z) means that:
- INT(y) ∩ INT(z) = ∅
- ∂y ∩ ∂z ≠ ∅

DC(x,z) means that:
- CL(x) ∩ CL(z) = ∅

But given that ∂y ∩ ∂z ≠ ∅, and INT(y) ⊂ INT(x), we have that ∂y ⊂ CL(x). So ∂y ∩ ∂z ⊂ CL(x) ∩ CL(z), which means CL(x) ∩ CL(z) ≠ ∅. This contradicts DC(x,z).

So I'm sure: the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm wondering if the composition table might be considering a different interpretation of the RCC-8 relations, or if there's a subtlety I'm missing. Let me try once more.

So we have TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z), and we're trying to determine the possible relations between x and z.

TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, which means the interior of y is a proper subset of the interior of x, and the boundaries of x and y intersect.

EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, which means the interiors of y and z are disjoint, but their boundaries intersect.

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z.

- DC(x,z): This would mean the closures of x and z are disjoint. But given that the boundaries of y and z intersect, and the interior of y is a subset of the interior of x, the boundary of y is in the closure of x. So the boundary of z intersects the closure of x, which means the closures of x and z are not disjoint. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

I'm sticking with my conclusion: the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, there's something subtle about the "boundary" in RCC-8 that I might be misunderstanding. In RCC-8, regions are treated as regular closed sets, and the boundary of a region is not necessarily part of the region. Two regions can share a boundary point without that point being part of either region.

But even with this understanding, if the boundaries of y and z intersect, and the interior of y is a subset of the interior of x, then the closure of x must intersect the boundary of z, which means the closures of x and z are not disjoint. So DC(x,z) is still not possible.

OK, I think I know what I might be missing. I'm thinking of the boundary of a region in a Euclidean space, where the boundary consists of points. But in RCC-8, the concept of a boundary is more abstract.

But let's try something. If the relation TPPi(x,y) means that y is a tangential proper part of x, that means y is a proper subset of x (i.e., y ⊂ x and y ≠ x), and y is connected to the complement of x. The relation EC(y,z) means that y and z are externally connected, which means they are connected but don't overlap (i.e., have no common interior points).

So, TPPi(x,y) implies that y ⊂ x, and EC(y,z) implies that y and z are connected. But if y ⊂ x and y is connected to z, then x must also be connected to z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I think the issue is with the composition table, as there can be errors or incomplete results in the computed compositions. So I'll stick with my reasoning: the possible relations between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

So summarizing, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. EC(x,z) - x and z are externally connected; they share at least one boundary point but no interior points.
2. PO(x,z) - x and z partially overlap; they share some interior points, but each has interior points not in the other.
3. TPPi(x,z) - z is a tangential proper part of x; all of z is in x, z is not equal to x, and z shares at least one boundary point with x.
4. NTPPi(x,z) - z is a non-tangential proper part of x; all of z is in x, z is not equal to x, and z doesn't share any boundary points with x.

So, the answer is: EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi.

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relationships can hold between x and z given the constraints TPPi(x,y) and EC(y,z).

Let me analyze each relationship step by step:

TPPi(x,y) means:
- y is completely inside x
- y touches the boundary of x
- y is a proper part of x (not equal to x)

EC(y,z) means:
- y and z touch at their boundaries
- y and z don't share any interior points

Now let's consider each possible relationship between x and z:

1. EC(x,z): This is possible. If z touches x exactly at the same boundary point where y touches x, then x and z would be externally connected.

2. PO(x,z): This is possible. If z partially extends into x (where it touches y) and partially extends outside x, then x and z would partially overlap.

3. TPPi(x,z): This is possible. If z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary, then z would be a tangential proper part of x.

4. NTPPi(x,z): This is possible. If z is completely inside x but doesn't touch x's boundary, then z would be a non-tangential proper part of x.

I need to check if any other relationships are possible:

- DC(x,z): Not possible because if y touches z, and y is inside x, then z must at least touch x.
- TPP(x,z): Not possible because x cannot be inside z when y is inside x and y touches z.
- NTPP(x,z): Not possible for similar reasons as TPP.
- EQ(x,z): Not possible because y is a proper part of x, so x and z cannot be equal.

### Answer: EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi
