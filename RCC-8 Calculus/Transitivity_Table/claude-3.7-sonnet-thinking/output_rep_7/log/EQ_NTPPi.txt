PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step.

We're given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- NTPPi(y,z): this means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary

Now, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are identical in terms of spatial extent. 
Since NTPPi(y,z), we know that z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given that x and y are identical (EQ(x,y)), any spatial relationship that holds between y and z must also hold between x and z.

So if NTPPi(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y), then we must also have NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, let me double-check this. 

EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident, occupying exactly the same space.
NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely inside y, not touching y's boundary.

Given that x and y occupy exactly the same space (EQ(x,y)), z must also be completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This would be NTPP(z,x), which is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to be extra careful. Let me think about this in terms of the definitions of the relations:

- EQ(x,y): x and y occupy exactly the same space.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Since x and y occupy exactly the same space, they have the same boundary and the same interior. So, if z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, then z is also completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

This confirms that the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I want to triple-check this by thinking about the basic properties of these relations:

- If EQ(x,y), then x and y have the same spatial extent and boundaries.
- If NTPPi(y,z), then z is a proper part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given that x and y have the same spatial extent (due to EQ(x,y)), and z is a proper part of y that doesn't touch y's boundary (due to NTPPi(y,z)), it follows that z is also a proper part of x that doesn't touch x's boundary. This is the definition of NTPP(z,x), which is equivalent to NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to be absolutely sure by reviewing the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected.
2. EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but don't share interior parts.
3. PO(x,y): x and y overlap, but neither is a part of the other.
4. TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (touches y's boundary).
5. NTPP(x,y): x is a non-tangential proper part of y (doesn't touch y's boundary).
6. TPPi(x,y): y is a tangential proper part of x (inverse of TPP).
7. NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x (inverse of NTPP).
8. EQ(x,y): x and y are equivalent (occupy the same space).

Given EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we want to determine the relationship between x and z.

EQ(x,y) means x and y are the same region.
NTPPi(y,z) means z is a proper part of y, without touching y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same, z must also be a proper part of x without touching x's boundary. This is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I want to be absolutely sure that I understood the definition of NTPPi. 

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). That is, z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given EQ(x,y), x and y have the same spatial extent.

So, z is completely inside y, and y is the same as x. Therefore, z is completely inside x, making z a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

To be absolutely, 100% sure, let me think about this once more from first principles:

1. EQ(x,y): x and y are spatially equivalent. They have the same interior and the same boundary.

2. NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP(z,y). It means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, given these two facts, what's the relationship between x and z?

Since x and y are spatially equivalent (due to EQ(x,y)), they have the same interior and boundary. So, any region that is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary must also be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary.

Given that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary (due to NTPPi(y,z)), z must also be completely inside x and not touch x's boundary. This makes z a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer to the question "If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me be clearer about the definitions:

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

But wait, that contradicts what I wrote before. Let me double-check.

Actually, no, NTPPi(y,z) does not mean NTPP(z,y). Let me clarify:

- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z), which means NTPP(z,y). This means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Actually, the second definition contradicts the first. Let me be absolutely clear:

- NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z). In the context of RCC-8, the "i" stands for "inverse". So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). 

Actually, I'm getting confused. Let me simplify:

Based on the information I have:

NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z). In RCC-8, "i" denotes the inverse relation. So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Actually, hold on. Let me reconsider the definition from the prompt:

The prompt states:
"NTPP(x,y) means that x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary. TPPi(x,y) is the same as TPP(y,x). NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)."

So, NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

Now, let's revisit the original problem:

If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then what's the relationship between x and z?

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are spatially equivalent. They have the same spatial extent, the same interior, and the same boundary.

Given NTPPi(y,z), which is the same as NTPP(z,y), z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are spatially equivalent (due to EQ(x,y)), and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary (due to NTPPi(y,z)), it follows that z is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This makes z a non-tangential proper part of x, which is NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Ok, so my answer is: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I want to double-check this one more time:

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary).

From EQ(x,y), we know that x and y have the same spatial extent. They have the same interior and the same boundary.

From NTPPi(y,z), we know that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y have the same spatial extent (due to EQ(x,y)), and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary (due to NTPPi(y,z)), it follows that z is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually wait, let me check if there could be multiple possible relationships. Since the RCC-8 relations are mutually exclusive, there can only be one correct relationship between x and z.

Given that x and y are coincident (due to EQ(x,y)), any relation that holds between y and z must also hold between x and z. Since the relation between y and z is NTPPi(y,z), the relation between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, there is only one possible relationship between x and z, which is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, wait. I'm making an error here because I'm saying "the relation between y and z is NTPPi(y,z)" when I should say "the relation between y and z is given as NTPPi(y,z)".

Let me think this through one more time:

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).
- NTPPi(y,z): According to the definition in the prompt, this is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

From EQ(x,y), we know that x and y have the same spatial extent. They have the same interior and the same boundary.

From NTPPi(y,z), we know that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y have the same spatial extent (due to EQ(x,y)), and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary (due to NTPPi(y,z)), it follows that z is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary. This means z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm concerned about making an error. Let me review the RCC-8 relations once more from the prompt:

DC(x,y): x and y are disconnected and share no spatial parts.
EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share any interior parts.
PO(x,y): x and y share a spatial part, but neither is part of the other.
TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
NTPP(x,y): x is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.
TPPi(x,y): the same as TPP(y,x).
NTPPi(x,y): the same as NTPP(y,x).
EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident.

Ok, so NTPPi(y,z) is the same as NTPP(z,y), meaning z is part of y but does not touch y's boundary.

Given EQ(x,y), x and y are coincident. Since z is part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x is coincident with y, it follows that z is also part of x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

I believe the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm going to triple check this:

Given:
- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space).
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

To find the relationship between x and z, I'll consider what it means for z to be a non-tangential proper part of y, given that x and y are coincident.

If z is a non-tangential proper part of y, then z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. Since x and y are coincident, they have the same spatial extent and the same boundary. Therefore, z is also completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary, making z a non-tangential proper part of x.

This corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So, the answer to the question "If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?" is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let's just make sure whether I should answer with "NTPPi(x,z)" or "NTPPi(z,x)". This is confusing me, so let me be sure I'm clear on the definitions.

- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y.
- Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) would mean NTPP(z,x), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (due to NTPPi(y,z)), and x and y are coincident (due to EQ(x,y)), it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. This would be represented as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

OK I think I was getting confused by the fact that NTPPi(y,z) is the inverse of NTPP(y,z). But NTPP(y,z) means y is a non-tangential proper part of z. So the inverse, NTPPi(y,z), means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. And the prompt confirms this by stating "NTPPi(x,y) is the same as NTPP(y,x)".

Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (due to NTPPi(y,z)), and x and y are coincident (due to EQ(x,y)), it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. This would be represented as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

So for the final answer, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z). And I am finally confident in this answer.

Actually, let's convert our reasoning into a spatial composition table. Composition tables are a common way to represent the result of combining two RCC-8 relations.

Given EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), we want to find the relation between x and z.

We can think of this as the composition of EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), denoted as EQ(x,y) ∘ NTPPi(y,z).

In RCC-8 composition tables, the composition of EQ with any other relation is that relation itself. This is because if x and y are the same (EQ(x,y)), then any relation between y and a third entity z will also hold between x and z.

So, EQ(x,y) ∘ NTPPi(y,z) = NTPPi(x,z).

Checking against the composition table, the result of composing EQ(x,y) with NTPPi(y,z) is indeed NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

OK, I'm overthinking this. Let me think through the problem step by step:

- EQ(x,y): x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space. From this, we can conclude that any relation that holds between y and another entity z will also hold between x and z.

- NTPPi(y,z): According to the definition provided, this is the same as NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given that x and y are coincident (due to EQ(x,y)), and z is a non-tangential proper part of y (due to NTPPi(y,z)), it follows that z is also a non-tangential proper part of x. This would be represented as NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, instead of relying on the composition table, I'm going to think about this from first principles:

- If x and y are the same (EQ(x,y)), then any relation that holds between y and z must also hold between x and z.
- If z is a non-tangential proper part of y (NTPPi(y,z)), then it must also be a non-tangential proper part of x, given that x and y are the same.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, I'm clearly overthinking this but let's use the definitions more explicitly:

- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident. They occupy exactly the same space.
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Since x and y are coincident (they occupy the same space), and z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary, it follows that z is also completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

This makes z a non-tangential proper part of x, which corresponds to the relation NTPP(z,x) or equivalently, NTPPi(x,z).

Therefore, the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

So my final answer is: If EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then the relationship between x and z is NTPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine how the given relationships EQ(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) constrain the possible relationship between x and z.

Starting with what we know:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- NTPPi(y,z) means z is a non-tangential proper part of y (which is the same as NTPP(z,y))

Since x and y are coincident (they have identical spatial extent and boundaries), any spatial relationship that holds between y and some other region must also hold between x and that same region.

Given that z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is completely inside y without touching y's boundary), and x is coincident with y, it follows that z must also be a non-tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the relationship between x and z must be NTPPi(x,z).

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)
