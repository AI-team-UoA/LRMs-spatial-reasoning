PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We're given:
- NTPPi(x,y): This means NTPP(y,x), i.e., y is a proper part of x and y does not touch x's boundary. In other words, y is completely contained within the interior of x.
- PO(y,z): This means y and z partially overlap. They share some parts, but neither is contained in the other.

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that y is completely contained within the interior of x, and z partially overlaps with y, let's consider the possible relationships:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? No, because z overlaps with y, and y is contained within x. So x and z must share at least the part where y and z overlap.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to touch at the boundary? This would mean z doesn't enter the interior of x. But since z overlaps with y, and y is completely in the interior of x, z must also enter the interior of x. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap? Yes, z could have a part that overlaps with y (and therefore is inside x), and another part that extends outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z? This would mean x is contained within z and touches z's boundary. Given our constraints, x would need to be contained within z, and z would extend beyond x to include parts of y (which is already known to partially overlap with z). This seems possible if z encompasses all of x and extends beyond it.

Wait, that's not right. If y is contained within x (from NTPPi(x,y)), and z partially overlaps with y, then z can't contain all of x. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z? For similar reasons as above, this is not possible. If y is contained within x, and z only partially overlaps with y, then z can't contain all of x.

6. TPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be contained within x and touch x's boundary. Since y is completely inside x and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be entirely inside x and touch its boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be completely contained within the interior of x, similar to y.

8. EQ(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be equal? If z and x are equal, then z contains y completely. But we know PO(y,z), which means y and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let me reconsider and make sure my reasoning is accurate. I think I have been a bit confused in my analysis.

NTPPi(x,y) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of x. So y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

PO(y,z) means y and z partially overlap. They share some parts, but neither is contained in the other.

Given these, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Since y is completely inside x, and z partially overlaps with y, z definitely has some part inside x (the part that overlaps with y). But z also has parts outside of y (since they partially overlap). These parts of z that are outside of y could be:
1. Still inside x
2. Partly inside and partly outside x
3. Touching x's boundary
4. Completely outside x

Let's go through the RCC-8 relations again:

1. DC(x,z): This would mean x and z don't share any parts. But since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must have some part inside x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): This would mean x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interiors. But since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must share some interior with x. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): This would mean x and z partially overlap. This is possible because z has some part inside x (the part that overlaps with y), and z can also have parts outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z): This would mean x is a tangential proper part of z (x is inside z and touches z's boundary). For this to be true, z would need to contain all of x, including y (since y is inside x). But if z contains all of y, then PO(y,z) would not hold (since PO means neither is contained in the other). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similarly, this would mean x is completely inside z without touching its boundary. Again, if z contains all of x, then it contains all of y, which contradicts PO(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a tangential proper part of x (z is inside x and touches x's boundary). This is possible because z can be inside x (which is consistent with z partially overlapping with y), and z can touch x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean z is a non-tangential proper part of x (z is completely inside x without touching its boundary). This is also possible because z can be inside x without touching its boundary, which is consistent with z partially overlapping with y.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean x and z are the same region. If x and z are the same, then z contains all of y. But if z contains all of y, then PO(y,z) would not hold (since PO means neither is contained in the other). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

But actually, let me reconsider again, because I think I'm still getting confused.

OK, so we have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is a non-tangential proper part of x. So y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap. They share some parts, but neither is contained in the other.

Let's draw this out:

```
  +---------------------+
  |         x           |
  |                     |
  |    +--------+       |
  |    |   y    |       |
  |    |  +-----|--+    |
  |    |  |     |  |    |
  |    +--|-----+  |    |
  |       |     z  |    |
  |       +--------+    |
  |                     |
  +---------------------+
```

Given this picture, what is the relationship between x and z?

In this diagram, z overlaps with y (PO(y,z)) and z is completely inside x, touching its boundary (TPPi(x,z)). However, this is just one example. I need to determine all the possible relationships that can satisfy the given conditions.

Let's redraw the picture for all the potential arrangements:

1. Possible arrangement for PO(x,z):

```
  +---------------------+
  |         x           |
  |                     |
  |    +--------+       |
  |    |   y    |       |
  |    |  +-----|-------+
  |    |  |     |       |
  |    +--|-----+       |
  |       |     z       |
  |       +-------------+
  |                     |
  +---------------------+
```

Here, z partially overlaps with y and also partially extends outside of x. This arrangement supports PO(x,z).

2. Possible arrangement for TPPi(x,z):

```
  +---------------------+
  |         x           |
  |                     |
  |    +--------+       |
  |    |   y    |       |
  |    |  +-----|--+    |
  |    |  |     |  |    |
  |    +--|-----+  |    |
  |       |     z  |    |
  |       +--------+    |
  |                     |
  +---------------------+
```

Here, z partially overlaps with y and is completely inside x, touching x's boundary. This arrangement supports TPPi(x,z).

3. Possible arrangement for NTPPi(x,z):

```
  +---------------------+
  |         x           |
  |                     |
  |    +--------+       |
  |    |   y    |       |
  |    |  +-----|--+    |
  |    |  |     |  |    |
  |    +--|-----+  |    |
  |       |     z  |    |
  |       +--------+    |
  |                     |
  +---------------------+
```

Here, z partially overlaps with y and is completely inside x, not touching x's boundary. This arrangement supports NTPPi(x,z).

Wait, I've drawn the same diagram for 2 and 3. Let's make sure I'm correct about this.

For TPPi(x,z), z is a tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and touches x's boundary. In the diagram, z is indeed inside x and touches the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is a non-tangential proper part of x, which means z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. To represent this, I need to redraw the diagram. Here's how it should look:

```
  +---------------------+
  |         x           |
  |                     |
  |    +--------+       |
  |    |   y    |       |
  |    |  +-----|--+    |
  |    |  |     |  |    |
  |    +--|-----+  |    |
  |       |     z  |    |
  |       +--------+    |
  |                     |
  +---------------------+
```

OK I drew the same one again. Let me try to be more explicit:

For NTPPi(x,z), z would be inside x but not touching x's boundary:

```
  +---------------------+
  |         x           |
  |                     |
  |    +--------+       |
  |    |   y    |       |
  |    |  +-----|--+    |
  |    |  |     |  |    |
  |    +--|-----+  |    |
  |       |     z  |    |
  |       +--------+    |
  |                     |
  +---------------------+
```

OK, in the diagram for NTPPi(x,z), the boundary of z does not touch the boundary of x. There's a space between them, indicating that z is completely within the interior of x.

Alright, so based on the diagrams and reasoning, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z): z partially overlaps with x.
- TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x.
- NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x.

Let me reconsider DC(x,z) though. I said it's not possible because z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, so z must have some part inside x. Let's check if that reasoning is correct:

If y is completely inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), and z partially overlaps with y (PO(y,z)), then z has some part inside y, which means it has some part inside x. So z and x cannot be disconnected. Thus, DC(x,z) is indeed not possible.

Similarly, for EC(x,z), since z has some part inside x (the part that overlaps with y), x and z cannot just touch at the boundaries. So, EC(x,z) is not possible.

For TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z), if z contains all of x, then it contains all of y. But we know that PO(y,z) holds, which means neither y nor z is contained in the other. So, TPP(x,z) and NTPP(x,z) are not possible.

For EQ(x,z), if x and z are the same, then z contains all of y, which again contradicts PO(y,z). So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, I've confirmed that the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hmm, actually let me double check all of these one by one again.

We have:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: This means x and z don't share any parts. But since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must have some part inside x. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: This means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interiors. But since z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, z must share some interior with x. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: This means x and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if z has a part inside x (the part that overlaps with y) and another part outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: This means x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. If x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x). But we know that PO(y,z) holds, which means y and z partially overlap, and neither is contained in the other. This creates a contradiction. So, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part: This means x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. For the same reason as above, this would imply that y is completely inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). So, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse: This means z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z partially overlaps with y (PO(y,z)) and the parts of z that don't overlap with y are still inside x, with z touching x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse: This means z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible if z partially overlaps with y (PO(y,z)) and the parts of z that don't overlap with y are still inside x, with z not touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: This means x and z are the same. If x and z are the same, then z contains all of y. But we know that PO(y,z) holds, which means y and z partially overlap, and neither is contained in the other. This creates a contradiction. So, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider the case for DC(x,z) and EC(x,z).

If NTPPi(x,y) and PO(y,z), then z partially overlaps with y. This means some parts of z are inside y and some parts are outside of y. Given that y is completely inside x, the parts of z that are inside y are also inside x. But the parts of z that are outside of y could be:
1. Inside x
2. Touching the boundary of x
3. Outside x

If all parts of z that are outside of y are also outside of x, and the parts of z that overlap with y don't reach the boundary of x, then EC(x,z) is still not possible. This is because the parts of z that overlap with y are inside x, not just at the boundary.

Similarly, for DC(x,z), if the parts of z that overlap with y are inside x, then x and z share some parts. So DC(x,z) is also not possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Hang on actually, let me make sure that I understand the definition of PO correctly. If two things partially overlap, they share some parts, but neither is fully contained in the other. And TPPi(x,z) means that z is a tangential proper part of x, meaning z is fully contained within x and touches x's boundary. If z is fully contained within x, is it still possible for z to partially overlap with y, given that y is a proper part of x? I think this is where I might be getting confused.

Let's revisit the definition of PO(y,z).

PO(y,z) means y and z share some parts, but neither is contained in the other. So, there are parts of y that are not in z, and there are parts of z that are not in y.

Given that y is completely inside x (NTPPi(x,y)), and z partially overlaps with y, we know there are parts of z inside x (the parts that overlap with y). The parts of z that don't overlap with y could be inside or outside of x.

For TPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is consistent with z partially overlapping with y. The parts of z that don't overlap with y are still inside x, and z can touch the boundary of x.

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. Again, this is consistent with z partially overlapping with y.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

Actually, no, my confusion before was that I drew the diagram wrong again. Let's try another time:

For PO(x,z), z partially overlaps with x. This means there are parts of z inside x (the parts that overlap with y) and parts of z outside of x.

```
  +---------------------+
  |         x           |
  |                     |
  |    +--------+       |
  |    |   y    |       |
  |    |  +-----|-------+
  |    |  |     |       |
  |    +--|-----+       |
  |       |             |
  |       |     z       |
  +-------|-------------+
          |             |
          +-------------+
```

For TPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Again, z partially overlaps with y.

```
  +---------------------+
  |         x           |
  |                     |
  |    +--------+       |
  |    |   y    |       |
  |    |  +-----|--+    |
  |    |  |     |  |    |
  |    +--|-----+  |    |
  |       |        |    |
  |       |     z  |    |
  |       +--------+    |
  |                     |
  +---------------------+
```

For NTPPi(x,z), z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

```
  +---------------------+
  |         x           |
  |                     |
  |    +--------+       |
  |    |   y    |       |
  |    |  +-----|--+    |
  |    |  |     |  |    |
  |    +--|-----+  |    |
  |       |     z  |    |
  |       +--------+    |
  |                     |
  |                     |
  +---------------------+
```

I think the mistake I made above for NTPPi(x,z) is that I didn't put enough space between the boundary of z and the boundary of x. In the diagram above, z is completely inside x and there's a clear gap between the boundaries of z and x, which represents NTPPi(x,z).

I think I get it now. Let's make sure I have the full picture of the cases with the reasoning. I have the facts:

- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap.

Given that y is completely inside x, and z partially overlaps with y, I have proven that z must have at least some part inside x (the part that overlaps with y). The parts of z that don't overlap with y can be inside or outside of x.

If all of z is inside x, then either TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z) holds, depending on whether z touches the boundary of x or not.

If only part of z is inside x, then PO(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I'm confident that I've considered all possible relationships, and these three are the only ones that can hold given the constraints. So the answer is PO(x,z), TPPi(x,z), and NTPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me go through each of the 8 RCC relationships once more, to make sure that I've covered everything.

1. DC(x,z) - Disconnected: Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? No, because z overlaps with y, and y is inside x. So x and z must share at least the part where y and z overlap. Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: Is it possible for x and z to touch at the boundary without sharing interiors? No, because z overlaps with y, and y is completely inside the interior of x. So x and z must share some interior regions. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z) - Partially Overlapping: Is it possible for x and z to partially overlap? Yes, z could have a part that overlaps with y (and therefore is inside x), and another part that extends outside of x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: Is it possible for x to be a tangential proper part of z? No, because if x is inside z, then y is also inside z (since y is inside x). But we know that PO(y,z) holds, which means y and z partially overlap, and neither is contained in the other. This creates a contradiction. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part: Is it possible for x to be a non-tangential proper part of z? No, for the same reason as above. If x is inside z, then y is inside z, which contradicts PO(y,z). Therefore, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part Inverse: Is it possible for z to be a tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be contained within x and touch x's boundary. Since y is completely inside x and z partially overlaps with y, it's possible for z to be entirely inside x and touch its boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Non-tangential Proper Part Inverse: Is it possible for z to be a non-tangential proper part of x? Yes, z could be completely contained within the interior of x, similar to y.

8. EQ(x,z) - Equal: Is it possible for x and z to be equal? No, because if x and z are the same, then z contains all of y. But we know that PO(y,z) holds, which means y and z partially overlap, and neither is contained in the other. This creates a contradiction. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPPi(x,z)
- NTPPi(x,z)

I am confident in my answer.

ANSWER:

I need to determine all possible RCC-8 relationships between x and z given:
- NTPPi(x,y): y is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary
- PO(y,z): y and z partially overlap (share some parts, but neither contains the other)

Let me analyze each possible relation:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible because z overlaps with y, and y is inside x, so z must share at least some part with x.

2. EC(x,z) - Not possible because z overlaps with y, which is in x's interior, so z must share interior points with x, not just boundary points.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible when z has parts inside x (where it overlaps with y) and parts outside x.

4. TPP(x,z) - Not possible because if x were inside z, then y would be completely inside z (since y is inside x), contradicting the PO(y,z) relation.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Not possible for the same reason as TPP(x,z).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Possible when z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Possible when z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible because if x=z, then z would contain all of y, contradicting PO(y,z).
