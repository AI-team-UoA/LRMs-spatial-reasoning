PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at a boundary but do not share interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary

Now we need to figure out the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z.

Since y is part of z (TPP(y,z)), and x touches y (EC(x,y)), there are a few possibilities:

1. x could be disconnected from z (DC(x,z)): This would mean x touches y at the boundary, but that part of y's boundary is not part of z's boundary. However, since y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), y touches z's boundary. So this scenario seems impossible because if x touches y, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, then x must at least touch z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. x could be externally connected to z (EC(x,z)): This would mean x touches z at the boundary but doesn't share any interior parts. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary, and that part of y's boundary is also part of z's boundary.

3. x could partially overlap with z (PO(x,z)): This would mean x and z share some spatial part, but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary, but also extends into z in other areas.

4. x could be a tangential proper part of z (TPP(x,z)): This would mean x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary, and that part of y's boundary is also part of z's boundary, and the rest of x is contained in z.

5. x could be a non-tangential proper part of z (NTPP(x,z)): This would mean x is fully contained in z without touching z's boundary. This seems impossible because if x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x cannot be completely inside z without touching its boundary.

6. z could be a tangential proper part of x (TPPi(x,z)): This would mean z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. This seems unlikely because y is part of z, and x only touches y at the boundary. For z to be contained in x, more of z (beyond y) would have to be contained in x, which contradicts the fact that x only touches y at the boundary.

7. z could be a non-tangential proper part of x (NTPPi(x,z)): This would mean z is fully contained in x without touching x's boundary. This is impossible by the same reasoning as TPPi(x,z).

8. x and z could be equal (EQ(x,z)): This would mean x and z are identical. This is impossible because y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at the boundary, so x and z can't be identical.

Let me double-check my reasoning:

For DC(x,z): If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then x touches y at the boundary, and y is part of z touching z's boundary. Could x be disconnected from z? If x touches y at y's boundary, and y touches z at z's boundary, it seems possible that x could be positioned in such a way that it's disconnected from z. For example, imagine y is a small circle inside z touching z's boundary at a point, and x is a small circle outside of z touching y's boundary at a different point. So DC(x,z) could be possible.

For EC(x,z): If x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z at the boundary, then x could also touch z at the boundary without sharing interior parts. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z): If x touches y at the boundary, but also extends into z in other areas, then x and z can partially overlap. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z): If x is contained in z and touches z's boundary, while also touching y at the boundary, then TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z): If x is fully contained in z without touching z's boundary, but touches y at the boundary, there's a contradiction because y touches z's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z): If z is contained in x and touches x's boundary, this would mean that z (which contains y) is part of x, which contradicts EC(x,y) because x would have to share interior parts with y. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

For NTPPi(x,z): By the same reasoning as TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

For EQ(x,z): If x and z are identical, this would mean x contains y as a tangential proper part, which contradicts EC(x,y). So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Ok, I'm not so confident in my reasoning. Let me try to visualize this more carefully. 

EC(x,y): x touches y at the boundary but they don't share interior parts.
TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between x and z:

DC(x,z) - This means x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? Let's think... If x only touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, could x be completely outside z? Yes, if the part of y that x touches is at the boundary where y touches z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z) - This means x touches z at the boundary but doesn't share interior parts. Is this possible? Yes, if x touches y at the point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z at the boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z) - This means x and z share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other. Is this possible? If x touches y only at the boundary, and y is fully inside z, how could x share interior parts with z? It would mean x extends into z beyond just touching y. This is possible if x touches y at y's boundary, but also has parts that extend into z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z) - This means x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? If x is inside z and touches z's boundary, and also touches y at y's boundary, this is consistent with our constraints. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z) - This means x is fully contained in z without touching z's boundary. Is this possible? If x touches y at y's boundary, and y touches z's boundary, then x cannot be fully inside z without touching z's boundary (because the point where x touches y is also a point where y touches z's boundary). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

TPPi(x,z) - This means z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. Is this possible? If z contains y, and x only touches y at the boundary, then z cannot be contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

NTPPi(x,z) - This means z is fully contained in x without touching x's boundary. By the same reasoning as TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

EQ(x,z) - This means x and z are identical. If z contains y as a proper part, and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z cannot be identical. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, upon more reflection, I don't think NTPP(x,z) is necessarily impossible. Let me reconsider.

If EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), then x touches y at the boundary, and y is part of z touching z's boundary. Could x be fully inside z without touching z's boundary (NTPP(x,z))? If x touches y at a part of y's boundary that doesn't touch z's boundary, and the rest of x is inside z, then NTPP(x,z) could be possible.

Wait, actually no, I need to be more precise.

EC(x,y) means x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. TPP(y,z) means y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Let's carefully analyze the possible relations between x and z:

DC(x,z): This would mean x and z are disconnected. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is part of z, could x be completely outside z? Yes, if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that also touches z's boundary. In this case, x would be outside z, touching y at the exact point where y touches z. So DC(x,z) is possible.

EC(x,z): This would mean x touches z at the boundary but doesn't share interior parts. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is part of z touching z's boundary, then x could touch z at the boundary without sharing interior parts. So EC(x,z) is possible.

PO(x,z): This would mean x and z share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other. If x touches y at the boundary and extends into z, sharing some interior parts with z, then PO(x,z) is possible.

TPP(x,z): This would mean x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. If x is inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y at y's boundary, this is consistent with our constraints. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

NTPP(x,z): This would mean x is fully contained in z without touching z's boundary. If x touches y at a part of y's boundary that doesn't touch z's boundary, and the rest of x is inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Actually, I need to be careful again. Let's go back to basics:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be fully contained in z without touching z's boundary. But we know that x touches y at the boundary. So, if x is inside z, it must touch y at a part of y's boundary that's inside z, not at the part where y touches z's boundary.

Is this possible? Well, since y is a tangential proper part of z (TPP(y,z)), y touches z's boundary, but not all of y's boundary needs to touch z's boundary. Some parts of y's boundary can be inside z. So, if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that's inside z, and the rest of x is also inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Ugh, hold on, I think I need to double check myself more carefully. I think I might have been considering the wrong relations in some scenarios.

Let's start with what we know:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

Carefully considering the possible relations between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. Is this possible? 
   If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, could x be completely outside z? 
   If y touches z's boundary and x touches y's boundary, x could be outside z if it touches y at a point where y doesn't touch z's boundary. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. EC(x,z): x touches z at the boundary but doesn't share interior parts. Is this possible? 
   If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z touching z's boundary, x could touch z at the boundary without sharing interior parts. This would happen if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

3. PO(x,z): x and z share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other. Is this possible? 
   If x touches y at the boundary and also extends into z beyond just touching y, then x and z can share interior parts without one being contained in the other. So PO(x,z) is possible.

4. TPP(x,z): x is contained in z and touches z's boundary. Is this possible? 
   If x is inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y at y's boundary, this is consistent with our constraints. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is fully contained in z without touching z's boundary. Is this possible? 
   If x touches y at a part of y's boundary that doesn't touch z's boundary, and the rest of x is inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible. But wait, I need to double check if it's consistent for x to touch y at y's boundary and still be a non-tangential proper part of z.

   If y touches z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), then not all of y's boundary needs to touch z's boundary. Some parts of y's boundary can be inside z. If x touches y at a part of y's boundary that's inside z, and the rest of x is also inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Hmm, OK, so NTPP(x,z) is possible. Let's try to construct an example. Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x as another circle inside z that touches y's boundary at a point inside z, but doesn't touch z's boundary. In this case, NTPP(x,z) would be true.

Now for the rest:

6. TPPi(x,z): z is contained in x and touches x's boundary. Is this possible? 
   If z contains y, and x only touches y at the boundary, then z cannot be contained in x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is fully contained in x without touching x's boundary. Is this possible? 
   By the same reasoning as TPPi(x,z), this is not possible.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are identical. Is this possible? 
   If z contains y as a proper part, and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z cannot be identical. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are: DC(x,z), EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me just check once more by diagramming each case to make sure:

1. DC(x,z): 
   z is a circle, y is a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x is a circle outside z that touches y's boundary at the exact point where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x and z are disconnected, making DC(x,z) true.

Wait, that example doesn't quite fit EC(x,y). Let me rethink DC(x,z):

Imagine z as a circle, y as a smaller circle inside z touching z's boundary at one point, and x as a circle outside z that touches y's boundary at a point different from where y touches z's boundary. In this case, x and z are disconnected, making DC(x,z) true.

Actually, I'm having trouble visualizing this. Let's go back to the definitions.

EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

For DC(x,z), x and z must be disconnected. But if x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z, how could x be disconnected from z? If y is inside z, touching z's boundary, and x touches y's boundary, then x must either touch z's boundary or be partially inside z.

But wait, I think I was visualizing y incorrectly. TPP(y,z) doesn't mean y is "inside" z in the sense of being surrounded by z. It means y is a proper part of z, and y touches z's boundary. So, it's like y is a subset of z, with some points of y on z's boundary.

So, let's try again for DC(x,z):

Imagine z as a region, y as a smaller region inside z with some part of y touching z's boundary, and x as a region outside z that touches y only at a point on z's boundary. In this case, x and z are disconnected, making DC(x,z) true.

Hold on, that doesn't work either. If x touches y at a point on z's boundary, then x would also touch z, making EC(x,z) true, not DC(x,z).

I think DC(x,z) is not possible if EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z). Let me rethink this.

If EC(x,y), then x and y touch at the boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y is part of z and touches z's boundary. If x touches y at a point on y's boundary, and y is part of z, then x must either touch z or share some interior parts with z. It can't be disconnected from z.

Actually, now that I think about it, I can maybe draw a different picture where DC(x,z) is possible. Let's say z is a donut, y is a part of the donut (a segment), and x is a small circle in the "hole" of the donut. Then, x can touch y at the boundary, y is part of z and touches z's boundary, and x and z can be disconnected.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's a valid representation of the RCC-8 relations. In the RCC-8 calculus, regions are typically considered to be regular closed sets, which means they don't have "holes". 

Actually, let's make this more rigorous using the definition of External Connection:

EC(x,y) holds if the intersection of their topological closures is non-empty, but the intersection of their interiors is empty.

And for Tangential Proper Part:

TPP(y,z) holds if y is a proper subset of z, and their boundaries have a non-empty intersection.

Let's work through this step-by-step:

DC(x,z) requires that the intersection of the closures of x and z is empty. But if x touches y at the boundary, and y is part of z, then the closure of x has a non-empty intersection with the closure of z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

EC(x,z) requires that the intersection of the closures of x and z is non-empty, but the intersection of their interiors is empty. This is possible if x touches z at the boundary without sharing interior parts. If x touches y at a point on z's boundary, then x would also touch z, making EC(x,z) true.

PO(x,z) requires that the intersection of the interiors of x and z is non-empty, but neither is a subset of the other. This is possible if x extends into z, sharing some interior parts with z, but not being fully contained in z.

TPP(x,z) requires that x is a proper subset of z and their boundaries have a non-empty intersection. This is possible if x is fully contained in z and touches z's boundary.

NTPP(x,z) requires that x is a proper subset of z and their boundaries have an empty intersection. This is possible if x is fully contained in z without touching z's boundary.

Let me check if these are all consistent with EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z):

If EC(x,y), then x touches y at the boundary. If TPP(y,z), then y is part of z and touches z's boundary. 

For DC(x,z) to be true, x and z must be disconnected. But if x touches y at the boundary, and y is part of z, then x must either touch z or share some interior parts with z. It can't be disconnected from z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

For EC(x,z) to be true, x must touch z at the boundary without sharing interior parts. This is possible if x touches y at a point on y's boundary, and that point is also on z's boundary. So EC(x,z) is possible.

For PO(x,z) to be true, x and z must share some interior parts but neither is contained in the other. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and also extends into z, sharing interior parts with z. So PO(x,z) is possible.

For TPP(x,z) to be true, x must be fully contained in z and touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y at y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is possible.

For NTPP(x,z) to be true, x must be fully contained in z without touching z's boundary. If x touches y at a part of y's boundary that's inside z, and the rest of x is also inside z without touching z's boundary, then NTPP(x,z) is possible.

Just one more check of the DC(x,z) case. So if x touches y's boundary and TPP(y,z), let me consider a different way this could happen. Let's say z is a circle, y is a line segment that starts at z's boundary and goes to the center of z. Now imagine x is a small circle that touches y only at y's inner endpoint (the one not on z's boundary). In this case, x is disconnected from z, making DC(x,z) true.

But actually, I don't think a line segment can be considered a region in the RCC-8 calculus. Regions are typically considered to be regular closed sets, which means they have non-empty interiors.

Actually, I've been thinking about this all wrong. I've been trying to construct different shapes, but the RCC-8 calculus is about the topological relationships between regions, regardless of their shape.

Let's go back to the definitions:

EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

For DC(x,z), x and z must be disconnected. But if x touches y at the boundary, and y is part of z, then x must have a non-empty intersection with z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

Let's actually try to be very careful and work from first principles.

If EC(x,y), then the topological closure of x and the topological closure of y have a non-empty intersection, but the interior of x and the interior of y have an empty intersection.

If TPP(y,z), then y is a proper subset of z, and the boundary of y and the boundary of z have a non-empty intersection.

Now, let's examine the possible relationships between x and z:

For DC(x,z) to be true, the closures of x and z must have an empty intersection.

If EC(x,y), then the closures of x and y have a non-empty intersection. Let's call a point in this intersection p.

If TPP(y,z), then y is a subset of z. So, the point p, which is in the closure of y, is also in the closure of z.

But p is also in the closure of x. So, the closures of x and z have a non-empty intersection (they both contain p). This contradicts the definition of DC(x,z).

Therefore, DC(x,z) is not possible.

OK, so the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Oh, I realize one more thing: if I'm being completely rigorous about the topological definitions, I believe that DC(x,z) actually is possible.

EC(x,y) means the boundaries of x and y intersect, but their interiors don't.
TPP(y,z) means y is a proper subset of z, and the boundaries of y and z intersect.

For DC(x,z) to be true, the closures of x and z must have an empty intersection.

If x and y have intersecting boundaries, and y is a proper subset of z, it's still possible for x and z to have non-intersecting closures if the part of y's boundary that intersects with x's boundary is not part of z's boundary.

But wait, if y is a proper subset of z, then all of y, including its boundary, is within z. So, if x's boundary intersects with y's boundary, it must also intersect with z's closure. This contradicts DC(x,z).

Actually, I need to remember something. In general topology, and especially when dealing with region connection calculus, regions have an interior, a boundary, and a closure. The closure is the union of the interior and the boundary.

The boundary of a region is the set of points that are in the closure but not in the interior. 

So, to clarify the definitions:

- EC(x,y) means that the interiors of x and y are disjoint, but their closures intersect. In other words, x and y touch only at their boundaries.
- TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper subset of z (in terms of closure), and the boundaries of y and z intersect.

For DC(x,z), the closures of x and z must be disjoint. But if x's closure intersects with y's closure (due to EC(x,y)), and y's closure is a subset of z's closure (due to TPP(y,z)), then x's closure must also intersect with z's closure. This contradicts DC(x,z).

So, DC(x,z) is not possible.

Again, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

OK let's double-check the list.

- x = external to z: DC(x,z) or EC(x,z)
- x = partially inside z: PO(x,z)
- x = inside z, touching boundary of z: TPP(x,z)
- x = inside z, not touching boundary of z: NTPP(x,z)
- z = inside x, touching boundary of x: TPPi(x,z)
- z = inside x, not touching boundary of x: NTPPi(x,z)
- x = z: EQ(x,z)

As we've established, x and y touch at the boundary, and y is a proper part of z touching z's boundary.

We've determined that DC(x,z) is not possible because if x touches y's boundary, and y is inside z, then x must also touch or overlap with z.

For EQ(x,z), x and z would have to be identical. But since y is a proper part of z, and x only touches y at the boundary, x and z cannot be identical. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

For TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z), z would have to be inside x. But since y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z) are not possible.

Now, one more careful check of NTPP(x,z). If x touches y only at the boundary (EC(x,y)), and y is a proper part of z touching z's boundary (TPP(y,z)), could x be fully inside z without touching z's boundary?

Wait, this is a tricky one. 

If x touches y at the boundary, and y touches z's boundary, could x be inside z without touching z's boundary? It depends on where exactly x touches y.

If x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary, then x would also touch z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) false. But if x touches y at a different point of y's boundary, a point that's inside z and not on z's boundary, then x could be fully inside z without touching z's boundary, making NTPP(x,z) possible.

So, NTPP(x,z) is possible if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that doesn't touch z's boundary.

In summary, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, I need to check my original objection to DC(x,z) more carefully. I know that EC(x,y) means that the interiors of x and y are disjoint, but their closures intersect. I also know that TPP(y,z) means that y is a proper subset of z, and the boundaries of y and z intersect.

If x and y have a point in common, say p, and if p is not in the interior of y, then p must be on the boundary of y. Now, if y is a proper subset of z, then p could be either in the interior of z or on the boundary of z. If p is on the boundary of z, then x and z would share the point p, making DC(x,z) false. But what if p is in the interior of z?

In that case, if p is on the boundary of y but in the interior of z, then p would be on the boundary of x and in the interior of z. This means that x and z would share the point p, making DC(x,z) false.

Alright, so DC(x,z) is definitely not possible.

In conclusion, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Actually, let me try once more to see if DC(x,z) is truly impossible.

1. EC(x,y): The interiors of x and y are disjoint, but their closures intersect. So, x and y touch only at their boundaries.
2. TPP(y,z): y is a proper subset of z, and the boundaries of y and z intersect.

Let's think step by step. If x and y touch at their boundaries (EC), then there's a point p that's in both the boundary of x and the boundary of y.

Now, since y is a proper subset of z (TPP), all of y, including its boundary, is within z or on z's boundary. So, the point p, which is on the boundary of y, is either in the interior of z or on the boundary of z.

If p is on the boundary of z, then x and z share the point p, making DC(x,z) false.

If p is in the interior of z, then x and z share the point p, again making DC(x,z) false.

So, in both cases, x and z share at least one point, which means DC(x,z) is impossible.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

Let me finally make sure I didn't miss anything. The original relationships we're given are:

1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts.
2. TPP(y,z): y is part of z and touches z's boundary.

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

DC(x,z) - Disconnected: x and z don't share any parts. We've determined this is not possible.

EC(x,z) - Externally Connected: x and z touch at the boundary but don't share interior parts. This is possible if x touches y at a point on z's boundary.

PO(x,z) - Partial Overlap: x and z share some parts, but neither is part of the other. This is possible if x touches y at the boundary and also extends into z, sharing interior parts with z.

TPP(x,z) - Tangential Proper Part: x is part of z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is inside z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y at y's boundary.

NTPP(x,z) - Non-Tangential Proper Part: x is part of z but doesn't touch z's boundary. This is possible if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that's inside z (not on z's boundary), and the rest of x is also inside z without touching z's boundary.

TPPi(x,z) - Inverse Tangential Proper Part: z is part of x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because if z contains y, and x only touches y at the boundary, then z cannot be contained in x.

NTPPi(x,z) - Inverse Non-Tangential Proper Part: z is part of x but doesn't touch x's boundary. By the same reasoning as above, this is not possible.

EQ(x,z) - Equal: x and z are identical. This is not possible because if z contains y as a proper part, and x only touches y at the boundary, then x and z cannot be identical.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

OK, to summarize: 

1. DC(x,z): Not possible.
2. EC(x,z): Possible.
3. PO(x,z): Possible.
4. TPP(x,z): Possible.
5. NTPP(x,z): Possible.
6. TPPi(x,z): Not possible.
7. NTPPi(x,z): Not possible.
8. EQ(x,z): Not possible.

Given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z), the possible relationships between x and z are: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), and NTPP(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and TPP(y,z).

First, let me understand what we know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
- TPP(y,z): y is a proper part of z and touches z's boundary

Analyzing each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z) - Not possible: If x touches y's boundary, and y is contained in z, then x must at least touch z.

2. EC(x,z) - Possible: x can touch z at the boundary without sharing interior parts, especially if x touches y at a point where y touches z's boundary.

3. PO(x,z) - Possible: x can partially overlap with z if x touches y at the boundary but also extends into z in other areas.

4. TPP(x,z) - Possible: x can be a tangential proper part of z if x is contained in z, touches z's boundary, and also touches y at y's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z) - Possible: x can be fully inside z without touching z's boundary if x touches y at a part of y's boundary that is inside z (not touching z's boundary).

6. TPPi(x,z) - Not possible: z cannot be contained in x when x only touches y at the boundary and y is part of z.

7. NTPPi(x,z) - Not possible: For the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z) - Not possible: x and z cannot be identical since y is a proper part of z and x only touches y at the boundary.

### Answer: EC(x,z), PO(x,z), TPP(x,z), NTPP(x,z)
