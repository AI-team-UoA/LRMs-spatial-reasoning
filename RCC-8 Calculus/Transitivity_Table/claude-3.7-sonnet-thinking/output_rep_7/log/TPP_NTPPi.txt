PROMPT: If TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) mean, and then figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

TPP(x,y) means:
- x is a tangential proper part of y
- x is part of y
- x touches y's boundary

NTPPi(y,z) means:
- NTPP(z,y)
- z is a non-tangential proper part of y
- z is part of y
- z does not touch y's boundary

So, we have:
- x is part of y and touches y's boundary
- z is part of y and does not touch y's boundary

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

First, are x and z disconnected? Given that both x and z are parts of y, they might be disconnected (DC) or they might share some space.

If x and z are disconnected, then DC(x,z) is a possibility.

Could x and z be externally connected (EC)? This means they touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, it doesn't touch y's boundary. And since x is a tangential proper part of y, it does touch y's boundary. It's possible that x and z could touch at their boundaries, so EC(x,z) is a possibility.

Could x and z partially overlap (PO)? This means they share some space, but neither is part of the other. This is definitely a possibility, given that both are parts of y but they could overlap.

Could x be a tangential proper part of z (TPP)? This would mean x is part of z and touches z's boundary. Since z is a non-tangential proper part of y, z is "fully inside" y. And since x touches y's boundary, it seems unlikely that x would be a part of z, because if x were part of z, and x touches y's boundary, then z would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z).

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me be more careful.

TPP(x,y) means x is a tangential proper part of y, which means x is inside y and touches y's boundary.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is a non-tangential proper part of y, so z is "fully inside" y (not touching y's boundary).

So we have x touching y's boundary, and z not touching y's boundary. Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, let me try to draw a picture. Let's represent y as a big circle, x as a smaller circle that's inside y but touches y's boundary, and z as another circle that's inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

y:  O
    |
x:  o
    |
z:  .

In this picture, y is the big O, x is the smaller o that touches the boundary of y, and z is the dot that's inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, what are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z don't overlap at all. In the picture, we could place the dot representing z somewhere inside y but away from x.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. This is possible if x and z just touch at a point or along a boundary. 

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. 

   Wait, this doesn't make sense with our given constraints. If x is inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary (because z contains x, and x touches y's boundary). But we know from NTPPi(y,z) that z doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is "fully inside" z, not touching z's boundary. 

   Again, this doesn't seem possible. If x is inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary (because z contains x, and x touches y's boundary). But we know from NTPPi(y,z) that z doesn't touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is "fully inside" x, not touching x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely contained within the interior of x.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. But this can't be true, because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be the same.

Actually, let's be more careful about the cases.

First, if z is inside x (i.e., TPPi(x,z) or NTPPi(x,z)), and x touches y's boundary, then we'd need to check if z can be positioned such that it doesn't touch y's boundary. Let's consider these cases more carefully.

TPPi(x,z) would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. Since x touches y's boundary, and z touches x's boundary, can z avoid touching y's boundary? Actually, yes. z can touch a part of x's boundary that's in the interior of y, away from y's boundary.

NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. In this case, z is clearly away from y's boundary (since it's in the interior of x), so this is consistent with NTPPi(y,z).

Now, let's reconsider the cases where x is inside z (i.e., TPP(x,z) or NTPP(x,z)).

TPP(x,z) would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and x is inside z, then z would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) would mean x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and x is inside z, then z would also touch y's boundary, which contradicts NTPPi(y,z). So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

Let's also reconsider the case of EQ(x,z).

EQ(x,z) would mean x and z are the same region. But we know that x touches y's boundary (from TPP(x,y)), and z doesn't touch y's boundary (from NTPPi(y,z)). So x and z can't be the same region, which means EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Let's double-check the cases of DC(x,z), EC(x,z), and PO(x,z).

DC(x,z) means x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z don't overlap at all.

EC(x,z) means x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. This is possible if x and z just touch at a point or along a boundary.

PO(x,z) means x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other.

Hmm, actually, I realize I'm thinking about this incorrectly. I didn't quite grasp that TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x, so z is inside x and touches the boundary of x. And NTPPi(x,z) would mean z is inside x and doesn't touch the boundary of x.

Let me reconsider the cases, thinking about them differently.

So we have:
- TPP(x,y): x is part of y and touches y's boundary.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of y (i.e., NTPP(z,y)), which means z is part of y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's visualize this: we have y as a big circle, x as a smaller circle that's inside y and touches y's boundary, and z as another circle that's inside y but doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, what are the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible if x and z don't overlap at all. In our visualization, we can place z inside y but away from x, so they don't share any points.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. This is possible if x and z just touch at a point or along a boundary. In our visualization, we can place z inside y such that it just touches the boundary of x.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible if x and z share some interior points, but neither is completely contained in the other. In our visualization, we can place z such that it overlaps with x, but neither is completely inside the other.

4. TPP(x,z): x is a tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is inside z and touches z's boundary. 

   In our visualization, this would mean x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But if x touches y's boundary, and x is inside z, then z would also touch y's boundary (because z contains x, and x touches y's boundary). But we know from NTPPi(y,z) that z doesn't touch y's boundary. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is a non-tangential proper part of z. This would mean x is "fully inside" z, not touching z's boundary. 

   Again, this doesn't seem possible. If x is inside z, and x touches y's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary. But we know from NTPPi(y,z) that z doesn't touch y's boundary. So NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is a tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely contained within x and touches x's boundary.

   In our visualization, we can place z inside x such that it touches x's boundary at a point that's in the interior of y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This would mean z is "fully inside" x, not touching x's boundary. This is possible if z is completely contained within the interior of x.

   In our visualization, we can place z fully inside x, away from x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. But this can't be true, because x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be the same.

So, out of the 8 possible RCC-8 relations, 5 are possible: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi. 

Actually, let's be even more thorough. We know that:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y.
- NTPPi(y,z): NTPP(z,y), z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

This means:
- x is inside y and touches y's boundary.
- z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, let's reason through all 8 possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): x and z are disconnected. This is possible; x and z can be inside y without overlapping.

2. EC(x,z): x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior points. This is possible; x and z can be inside y and just touch at their boundaries.

3. PO(x,z): x and z partially overlap. This is possible; x and z can be inside y and share some space.

4. TPP(x,z): x is inside z and touches z's boundary. This would mean z contains x. But if x touches y's boundary, and z contains x, then z would also touch y's boundary. But we know z doesn't touch y's boundary, so TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): x is inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Again, if x touches y's boundary, and z contains x, then z would also touch y's boundary. But we know z doesn't touch y's boundary, so NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. TPPi(x,z): z is inside x and touches x's boundary. This is possible; z can be inside x and touch x's boundary at a point that's in the interior of y.

7. NTPPi(x,z): z is inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is possible; z can be fully inside x, away from x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): x and z are the same region. But x touches y's boundary and z doesn't, so they can't be the same.

So, the possible RCC-8 relations between x and z are: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, and NTPPi.

So the answer is: DC, EC, PO, TPPi, NTPPi

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine which RCC-8 relations are possible between x and z given that TPP(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me break down what we know:
- TPP(x,y): x is a tangential proper part of y (x is inside y and touches y's boundary)
- NTPPi(y,z): equivalent to NTPP(z,y), meaning z is a non-tangential proper part of y (z is inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary)

Analyzing each possible relation between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Possible. Both x and z are inside y but can be completely separate.

2. EC(x,z): Possible. They can touch at their boundaries while both being inside y.

3. PO(x,z): Possible. They can partially overlap while both being inside y.

4. TPP(x,z): Not possible. If x were inside z and touched z's boundary, and x also touches y's boundary, then z would necessarily touch y's boundary - contradicting NTPP(z,y).

5. NTPP(x,z): Not possible. For the same reason as above - if x is inside z and x touches y's boundary, then z must also touch y's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be inside x and touch x's boundary at points that don't correspond to where x touches y's boundary.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Possible. z can be completely inside x without touching x's boundary.

8. EQ(x,z): Not possible. x touches y's boundary while z does not, so they cannot be equal.
