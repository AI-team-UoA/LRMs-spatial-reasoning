PROMPT: If EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We're given:
1. EQ(x,y) - x and y are coincident, meaning they occupy exactly the same space.
2. TPPi(y,z) - This means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. In other words, z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Now we need to determine the relationship between x and z.

Since EQ(x,y), x and y are the same spatial region. And since TPPi(y,z), we know that y contains z and z touches y's boundary.

Since x and y are the same spatial region (EQ(x,y)), if y contains z and z touches y's boundary, then x also contains z and z touches x's boundary.

This means TPPi(x,z), or equivalently, TPP(z,x).

Actually, I should double-check this by thinking about the definitions more carefully.

EQ(x,y) means x and y occupy exactly the same space.
TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y), which means z is a tangential proper part of y. This means z is completely contained within y and touches y's boundary.

Since x and y occupy exactly the same space (EQ(x,y)), and z is a tangential proper part of y (TPP(z,y)), it follows that z is also a tangential proper part of x (TPP(z,x)), which is equivalent to TPPi(x,z).

So the relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check this one more time using a concrete example. Imagine:
- y is a square
- x is also a square that's exactly the same as y (EQ(x,y))
- z is a smaller square inside y that touches y's boundary (TPP(z,y) or TPPi(y,z))

Since x and y are the same square, z is also inside x and touches x's boundary. So TPP(z,x) or TPPi(x,z).

So the answer is TPPi(x,z).

ANSWER:

I need to determine what relation holds between x and z given that EQ(x,y) and TPPi(y,z).

Let's analyze what these relations tell us:
- EQ(x,y) means x and y are coincident (they occupy exactly the same space)
- TPPi(y,z) means TPP(z,y) - in other words, z is a tangential proper part of y (z is contained in y and touches y's boundary)

Since x and y are coincident (they are spatially identical), and z is a tangential proper part of y, then z must also be a tangential proper part of x.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is TPPi(x,z).

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
