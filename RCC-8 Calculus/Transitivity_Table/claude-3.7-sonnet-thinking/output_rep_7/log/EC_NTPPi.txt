PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step-by-step. We know two relationships:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
2. NTPPi(y,z): y is a non-tangential proper part of z, which means z is a proper part of y and does not touch y's boundary. In other words, NTPP(z,y).

Now we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that EC(x,y), x touches y at the boundary but shares no interior.
Given that NTPP(z,y), z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. If x only touches y at the boundary, and z is completely inside y (away from the boundary), then x and z would be disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): For this to be true, x and z would need to touch at their boundaries. However, since z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary, and x only touches y at the boundary, it seems impossible for x and z to touch. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, let me reconsider. If z is very close to the boundary of y, and x touches y at that same location, could x and z touch? No, because NTPP(z,y) specifies that z is not touching y's boundary, so there must be some distance between z and the boundary of y. Since x is outside of y and only touches y at the boundary, x cannot touch z. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. PO(x,z): For this to be true, x and z would need to partially overlap. But since x is outside of y (only touching at the boundary) and z is completely inside y, they cannot overlap. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. TPP(x,z): For this to be true, x would need to be a tangential proper part of z. But we know that x is outside of y (only touching at the boundary), and z is completely inside y, so x cannot be part of z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. NTPP(x,z): Similar to TPP, this is not possible because x cannot be inside z when x is outside of y and z is inside y.

6. TPPi(x,z): For this to be true, z would need to be a tangential proper part of x. This means z would need to be inside x and touch x's boundary. 

Let's think about this. We know that z is completely inside y. We also know that x touches y at the boundary. Could z be inside x? If z is inside y, and x extends beyond y (since x is touching y at the boundary and is outside of y), then it's possible for z to be inside x if x encompasses part of the inside of y.

However, EC(x,y) specifies that x and y don't share any interior parts, they only touch at the boundary. So x cannot encompass any part of the inside of y, which means z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. NTPPi(x,z): Similar to TPPi, this is not possible because z cannot be inside x when z is inside y and x is outside of y (only touching at the boundary).

8. EQ(x,z): For this to be true, x and z would need to be the same region. But we know that x is outside of y (only touching at the boundary) and z is inside y, so they cannot be the same. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

Wait, I think I made a conceptual error. Let me reconsider.

NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z. This means that z contains y, and y does not touch z's boundary. In other words, NTPP(y,z).

So we have:
1. EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts
2. NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary

Now, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. DC(x,z): Is it possible for x and z to be disconnected? We know that x touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside z. Since y is inside z, and x touches y, it seems that x must at least touch z. So DC(x,z) is not possible.

2. EC(x,z): Is it possible for x to touch z at the boundary without sharing interior parts? Yes, this is possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and y is inside z but away from z's boundary, then x could also touch z at its boundary without entering z's interior.

Actually, let me reconsider. If y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary (NTPP(y,z)), and x touches y at the boundary (EC(x,y)), then x must at least touch z or even enter z's interior. So EC(x,z) is one possibility.

Wait, if x touches y at the boundary, and y is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x must enter z's interior to touch y. So EC(x,z) is not possible.

Actually, I'm confused about the definitions. Let me rethink and be more precise.

EC(x,y) means that the boundaries of x and y touch, but their interiors do not intersect.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is completely inside z, including its boundary. That is, y's closure is a subset of z's interior.

Given these definitions, if x touches y at the boundary, and y is completely inside z (including its boundary), then x must at least enter z to touch y. So EC(x,z) could be possible if x touches z at its boundary and also enters z just enough to touch y.

Actually, there's still a problem with my understanding. Let me reconsider.

EC(x,y) means that the boundaries of x and y touch, but their interiors do not intersect.
NTPP(y,z) means that y is completely inside z, and y does not touch z's boundary. This means that there is some "buffer" space between y's boundary and z's boundary.

If x touches y at the boundary, and there is a buffer space between y's boundary and z's boundary, then x must penetrate z's boundary to reach y. This means that x and z cannot be disconnected (DC), and they cannot just touch at the boundary (EC). They must have some overlap.

So, the possible relationships include:

1. PO(x,z): This is possible if x enters z just enough to touch y at the boundary. In this case, part of x is inside z, and part is outside, which is the definition of PO.

2. TPP(x,z): This would mean that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is small and only touches y at one point.

3. NTPP(x,z): This would mean that x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary. This is not possible because if x touches y at the boundary, and there is a buffer space between y's boundary and z's boundary, then x cannot be completely inside z without touching z's boundary.

Hmm, let me think again. I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Let's use the fact that these relations are pairwise disjoint and mutually exhaustive, which means exactly one of them holds between any two spatial regions.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): y properly contains z, and z doesn't touch y's boundary. In other words, NTPP(z,y).

Actually, let's be careful about the relationship NTPPi(y,z). This means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z, i.e., NTPP(y,z). So y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Let me try again. We have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, if x touches y at the boundary, and y is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary), then x must enter z to touch y. The question is: how much of x is inside z?

1. PO(x,z): This is possible if part of x is inside z (the part that touches y) and part is outside.

2. TPP(x,z): This would mean that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is shaped in such a way that it touches y at the boundary and also touches z at the boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z): This would mean that x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is small and only touches y at the boundary, and doesn't extend to touch z's boundary.

4. EC(x,z): This would mean that x touches z at the boundary but doesn't enter z's interior. This is not possible because if x touches y at the boundary, and y is strictly inside z, then x must enter z's interior to touch y.

5. DC(x,z): This would mean that x and z are disconnected. This is not possible because if x touches y and y is inside z, then x must at least touch z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x. This is not possible because y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, so x cannot contain all of z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is a non-tangential proper part of x. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are the same region. This is not possible because x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, so they cannot be the same.

Actually, let me just draw out a picture.

Suppose we have nested circles where the innermost circle is z, the middle circle is y, and the outermost shape is x. If NTPP(y,z), that means y is strictly inside z, not touching z's boundary. And if EC(x,y), that means x touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y.

But this picture doesn't work because if y is inside z, and x touches y, then x must also intersect with z, which means x and z cannot be disconnected.

OK let me be more careful. Let's say:
- y is a circle
- z is a larger circle that completely contains y, with some buffer space (i.e. NTPP(y,z))
- x is a shape that touches y at the boundary but doesn't overlap with y (i.e. EC(x,y))

In this case, to touch y, x must cross the boundary of z. So part of x is inside z, and part is outside. This corresponds to PO(x,z).

But actually, I need to consider other possibilities.

1. PO(x,z): As I just said, this is possible if x crosses the boundary of z to touch y, with part of x inside z and part outside.

2. TPP(x,z): This would be the case if x is completely inside z but touches z's boundary. Is this possible? If x touches y at the boundary, and y is strictly inside z, then x extends from y's boundary. If x is fully inside z, but also touches z's boundary, then x would span from y's boundary to z's boundary. This is possible.

3. NTPP(x,z): This would be the case if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary. Is this possible? If x touches y at the boundary and is small enough to not touch z's boundary, then yes, this is possible.

OK so based on my pictorial inference, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Actually, let's double check with a different approach.

If EC(x,y) and NTPP(y,z), then x must enter z to touch y. This means that x and z cannot be disconnected (DC), and they cannot just touch at the boundary (EC). They must have some overlap.

So, the possible relationships include:

1. PO(x,z): This is possible if part of x is inside z (the part that touches y) and part is outside.

2. TPP(x,z): This would mean that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. This is possible if x is shaped in such a way that it touches y at the boundary and also extends to touch z's boundary.

3. NTPP(x,z): This would mean that x is completely inside z and does not touch z's boundary. This is possible if x is shaped in such a way that it touches y at the boundary but doesn't extend to touch z's boundary.

4. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, so x cannot contain all of z.

5. NTPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is completely inside x and doesn't touch x's boundary. This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

6. EQ(x,z): This would mean that x and z are the same region. This is not possible because x touches y at the boundary, and z completely contains y, so they cannot be the same.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

I think there is a composition table for RCC-8 that I could consult for this, but I'll keep thinking about it to ensure my answer is correct.

Actually, let me be more precise again in how I think about it.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(y,z): y is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

Now, to determine the possible relationships between x and z, let's think about it in terms of the relationship between the boundary of x and the boundary of z.

First, the boundaries of x and y touch (from EC(x,y)). Second, y is strictly inside z (from NTPP(y,z)), which means the boundary of y is strictly inside the boundary of z.

If the boundary of x touches the boundary of y, and the boundary of y is strictly inside the boundary of z, then the boundary of x must enter the interior of z. This means that x and z must have some overlap.

Now, let's consider the possible RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This is not possible because x must at least enter z to touch y.

2. EC(x,z): This is not possible for the same reason.

3. PO(x,z): This is possible if part of x is inside z (the part that touches y) and part is outside.

4. TPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is possible if x is completely inside z and doesn't touch z's boundary.

6. TPPi(x,z): This would mean that z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. This is not possible because y is inside z, and x only touches y at the boundary, so x cannot contain all of z.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is not possible for the same reason as TPPi.

8. EQ(x,z): This is not possible because x touches y at the boundary, and z completely contains y, so they cannot be the same.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

Let's imagine an example and double-check.

Suppose y is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. z is a circle with radius 3 centered at the origin. So y is strictly inside z (i.e. NTPP(y,z)).

Now, there are a few ways we can define x such that it touches y at the boundary:

1. x could be a circle with radius 2 centered at (3, 0). Then x touches y at the point (1, 0). In this case, part of x is inside z and part is outside, so PO(x,z) holds.

2. x could be a circle with radius 2 centered at (1, 0). Then x touches y at the point (0, 1). In this case, x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, so TPP(x,z) holds.

3. x could be a small circle centered near the boundary of y. If this circle is small enough, it could touch y at the boundary but not extend to touch z's boundary. In this case, NTPP(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This confirms my answer.

Actually, I made a mistake in my last example. Let me correct it:

Suppose y is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. z is a circle with radius 3 centered at the origin. So y is strictly inside z (i.e. NTPP(y,z)).

Now, there are a few ways we can define x such that it touches y at the boundary:

1. x could be a circle with radius 2 centered at (3, 0). Then x touches y at the point (1, 0). In this case, part of x is inside z and part is outside, so PO(x,z) holds.

2. x could be a circle with radius 1 centered at (2, 0). Then x touches y at the point (1, 0). In this case, x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary, so TPP(x,z) holds.

3. x could be a small circle centered at (1 + ε, 0) for a small positive ε. If this circle has radius ε, it touches y at the point (1, 0). If ε is small enough, x will be completely inside z and won't touch z's boundary. In this case, NTPP(x,z) holds.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are indeed:
- PO(x,z)
- TPP(x,z)
- NTPP(x,z)

This confirms my answer.

Wait! I think I made an error in my understanding. Let me re-check the definition of NTPPi.

NTPPi(y,z) means that y is a non-tangential proper part of z's inverse.

Wait that doesn't seem right, let me think about it again.

NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y). So z is a non-tangential proper part of y.

OK so given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now I draw it out again. x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y. So x and z are separated by some buffer space, and they don't touch or overlap. This corresponds to DC(x,z).

Actually, let me double-check:

NTPPi(y,z) means that the inverse of NTPP holds between y and z. The inverse of NTPP(y,z) is NTPP(z,y). So, NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, if x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), then x and z are separated by some buffer space. This means that x and z don't touch or overlap, which corresponds to DC(x,z).

I think the answer is that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me draw another picture to confirm:

Suppose y is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. z is a circle with radius 0.5 centered at the origin. So z is strictly inside y (i.e. NTPP(z,y)).

Now, x could be another circle that touches y at the boundary. For example, x could be a circle with radius 1 centered at (2, 0). Then x touches y at the point (1, 0).

In this case, x and z are separated by a buffer space. The closest that x gets to z is at the point (1, 0), which is on the boundary of y. But z is strictly inside y, so there's a distance between z and the boundary of y. Therefore, x and z are disconnected, which means DC(x,z) holds.

So, I'm confident now that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, actually, I need to be more careful. Let's think about all possible configurations.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

1. Case 1: x and z are disconnected. This is the case I just described, where x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y. So DC(x,z) is possible.

2. Case 2: x and z touch at their boundaries. Is this possible? If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then there's a buffer space between z and the boundary of y. So x and z cannot touch, which means EC(x,z) is not possible.

3. Case 3: x and z partially overlap. Is this possible? If x touches y at the boundary but doesn't enter y, and z is strictly inside y, then x and z cannot overlap. So PO(x,z) is not possible.

4. Case 4: x is a tangential proper part of z. Is this possible? If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then x cannot be inside z. So TPP(x,z) is not possible.

5. Case 5: x is a non-tangential proper part of z. For the same reason as case 4, NTPP(x,z) is not possible.

6. Case 6: z is a tangential proper part of x. Is this possible? If z is strictly inside y, and x touches y at the boundary, then z could be inside x if x extends beyond y. But EC(x,y) specifies that x and y don't share any interior parts, they only touch at the boundary. So x cannot extend into y, which means z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

7. Case 7: z is a non-tangential proper part of x. For the same reason as case 6, NTPPi(x,z) is not possible.

8. Case 8: x and z are the same region. Is this possible? If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then they cannot be the same region. So EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me double check one more time. Specifically let me think about whether TPPi(x,z) is possible. This would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x.

We know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

Let's think about this: If z is strictly inside y, and x touches y at the boundary, can z be inside x? For z to be inside x, x would need to extend into y. But EC(x,y) specifies that x and y don't share any interior parts, they only touch at the boundary. So x cannot extend into y, which means z cannot be inside x. So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

The ONLY possible relationship is DC(x,z).

Let me just be completely sure.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z): The inverse of NTPP holds between y and z. This means NTPP(z,y), so z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

What are the possible relationships between x and z?

Let's consider each of the RCC-8 relations:

1. DC(x,z): This is possible if x and z are disconnected. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), then x and z are separated by some buffer space, which means they're disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), then there's a buffer space between z and the boundary of y. So x and z cannot touch.

3. PO(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary but doesn't enter y, and z is strictly inside y, then x and z cannot overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then x cannot be inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then x cannot be inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is not possible. If z is strictly inside y, and x touches y at the boundary, then z cannot be inside x because x cannot extend into y (since EC(x,y) means x and y don't share any interior parts).

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is not possible. If z is strictly inside y, and x touches y at the boundary, then z cannot be strictly inside x because x cannot extend into y.

8. EQ(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then they cannot be the same region.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Therefore, if EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) [which means NTPP(z,y)], then the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait, I've just had a realization. Let me re-review the definition of EC once more.

EC(x,y) means that the boundaries of x and y touch, but their interiors do not intersect.

This means that x and y don't overlap, but they touch at the boundary. So, x is outside of y, and they touch at the boundary.

Let me also review the definition of NTPP.

NTPP(z,y) means that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary. This means that there is a buffer space between z and the boundary of y.

So, if x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), then x and z are separated by some buffer space. This means that x and z don't touch or overlap, which corresponds to DC(x,z).

I'm confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I need to be careful about TPPi(x,z) and NTPPi(x,z). Let me think again.

TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Is this possible? If z is strictly inside y, and x touches y at the boundary, can z be inside x? 

For z to be inside x, x would need to extend into y's interior. But EC(x,y) specifies that x and y don't share any interior parts, they only touch at the boundary. So x cannot extend into y's interior, which means z cannot be inside x (because z is strictly inside y's interior). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) would mean that z is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary). For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Let me draw a picture to make sure:

Suppose y is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. z is a circle with radius 0.5 centered at the origin. So z is strictly inside y (i.e. NTPP(z,y)).

Now, x could be another circle that touches y at the boundary. For example, x could be a circle with radius 1 centered at (2, 0). Then x touches y at the point (1, 0).

In this case, x and z are separated by a buffer space. The closest that x gets to z is at the point (1, 0), which is on the boundary of y. But z is strictly inside y, so there's a distance between z and the boundary of y. Therefore, x and z are disconnected, which means DC(x,z) holds.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I need to be more careful because I'm too fixated on circles. Let me think about the general case.

We know:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Now, the boundary of x touches the boundary of y. The boundary of y does not touch z (because NTPP(z,y)). So, the boundary of x does not touch z. Also, since EC(x,y), the interior of x does not intersect with the interior of y. Since z is completely inside the interior of y, the interior of x does not intersect with z. Therefore, x and z don't touch or overlap, which means DC(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

I'm confident in this answer, but let me double-check one more time to make sure I haven't missed anything.

TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. But we know that z is strictly inside y, and x does not enter y's interior (because EC(x,y)). So, z cannot be inside x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Similarly, NTPPi(x,z) would mean that z is strictly inside x (not touching x's boundary). For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

PO(x,z) would mean that x and z partially overlap. But we know that z is strictly inside y, and x does not enter y's interior. So, x and z cannot overlap. Therefore, PO(x,z) is not possible.

TPP(x,z) would mean that x is completely inside z and touches z's boundary. But we know that x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y. So, x cannot be inside z. Therefore, TPP(x,z) is not possible.

NTPP(x,z) would mean that x is strictly inside z (not touching z's boundary). For the same reason as above, this is not possible.

EC(x,z) would mean that x and z touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts. But we know that z is strictly inside y, and x touches y at the boundary. So, there's a buffer space between x and z, which means they don't touch. Therefore, EC(x,z) is not possible.

EQ(x,z) would mean that x and z are the same region. But we know that x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y. So, they cannot be the same region. Therefore, EQ(x,z) is not possible.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Ah actually I misunderstood the problem again.

NTPPi(y,z) means the inverse of NTPP holds between y and z. The inverse of NTPP(y,z) is NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

So, given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

What are the possible relationships between x and z?

1. DC(x,z): This is possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), then x and z are disconnected.

2. EC(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), then there's a buffer space between z and the boundary of y. So x and z cannot touch.

3. PO(x,z): This is not possible. If x doesn't enter y's interior (because EC(x,y)), and z is strictly inside y, then x and z cannot overlap.

4. TPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then x cannot be inside z.

5. NTPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then x cannot be inside z.

6. TPPi(x,z): This is not possible. If z is strictly inside y, and x doesn't enter y's interior (because EC(x,y)), then z cannot be inside x.

7. NTPPi(x,z): This is not possible. For the same reason as above, z cannot be strictly inside x.

8. EQ(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then they cannot be the same region.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Therefore, my final answer is: if EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) [which means NTPP(z,y)], then the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Wait a sec. I think I'm confused by the notation. NTPPi means the inverse relation.

NTPPi(y,z) means that NTPP(z,y), which means z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

OK so my above derivation where I assume "NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary" is correct.

So the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

HOLD ON. I think I'm confused by the definition of "inverse" here. Let's use the definition that "inverse" means "in the other direction." So NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y).

So we have:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

Let's visualize this:
- y is a larger circle
- z is a smaller circle strictly inside y
- x is a shape that touches y at the boundary but doesn't enter y's interior

In this case, x and z are separated by a buffer space, so they're disconnected. Therefore, DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship.

Let me check one more time:

DC(x,z): This is possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), then x and z are separated by a buffer space, which means they're disconnected.

EC(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), then there's a buffer space between z and the boundary of y. So x and z cannot touch.

PO(x,z): This is not possible. If x doesn't enter y's interior (because EC(x,y)), and z is strictly inside y, then x and z cannot overlap.

TPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then x cannot be inside z.

NTPP(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then x cannot be inside z.

TPPi(x,z): This is not possible. If z is strictly inside y, and x doesn't enter y's interior (because EC(x,y)), then z cannot be inside x.

NTPPi(x,z): This is not possible. For the same reason as above, z cannot be strictly inside x.

EQ(x,z): This is not possible. If x touches y at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y, then they cannot be the same region.

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, the definition of NTPPi might be different from what I've been assuming. Let me check again.

NTPPi(y,z) means that the inverse of NTPP holds between y and z. In the context of RCC-8, "inverse" refers to a relation where the arguments are swapped. So, NTPPi(y,z) is equivalent to NTPP(z,y).

OK so I've had the correct definition: NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y).

Now back to my previous reasoning.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

I've shown above that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let's double check that my logic for TPPi(x,z) is correct.

TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is a tangential proper part of x. This means that z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary.

Is it possible for z to be completely inside x if z is strictly inside y and x only touches y at the boundary? Let's think about this carefully.

For z to be inside x, x would need to enter y's interior, because z is strictly inside y. But EC(x,y) means that x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't enter y's interior. So, x cannot enter y's interior, which means z cannot be inside x. Therefore, TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Yes, so DC(x,z) is the only possible relationship. That is, x and z are disconnected.

OK, I've double-checked my reasoning, and I'm confident that the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, I should reconsider an earlier assumption which I might have gotten wrong. I said "EC(x,y) means that x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts." But a more precise definition is "EC(x,y) means that the boundaries of x and y touch, but their interiors do not intersect."

So EC(x,y) means that x and y don't share any interior points. But can EC(x,y) allow some part of x to be inside y?

No, if part of x is inside y, then some interior points of x would be interior points of y, which contradicts "their interiors do not intersect." So, EC(x,y) means that x is outside of y, and they touch at the boundary.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

If x is outside of y and they touch at the boundary, and z is strictly inside y (not touching y's boundary), then x and z are separated by a buffer space. This means that x and z don't touch or overlap, which corresponds to DC(x,z).

So, the only possible relationship between x and z is DC(x,z).

Actually, let me reconsider the case of TPPi again, because I think that was my main point of confusion.

TPPi(x,z) would mean that z is completely inside x and touches x's boundary. Is this possible?

If z is strictly inside y, and x touches y at the boundary, can z be inside x? For z to be inside x, x would need to extend into y's interior. But EC(x,y) specifies that x and y don't share any interior parts, they only touch at the boundary. So x cannot extend into y's interior, which means z cannot be inside x (because z is strictly inside y's interior). So TPPi(x,z) is not possible.

Yes, I see now. So DC(x,z) is the only possibility.

Given:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share interior parts.
- NTPP(z,y): z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary.

What are the possible relationships between x and z?

The only possible relationship is DC(x,z).

OK so the final answer is:

If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), then the relationship between x and z must be DC(x,z).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I'll determine what relationships are possible between x and z given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z).

First, let me clarify what these relationships mean:
- EC(x,y): x and y touch at their boundaries but don't share any interior parts
- NTPPi(y,z): This is the inverse of NTPP, so it means NTPP(z,y) - that z is completely inside y and doesn't touch y's boundary

Now, I'll analyze what relationship(s) could hold between x and z:

Since EC(x,y), x is outside of y and only touches y at the boundary.
Since NTPP(z,y), z is completely contained within y's interior and doesn't touch y's boundary.

This means there must be some buffer space between z and the boundary of y. Since x only touches y at the boundary and doesn't enter y's interior, x cannot:
- Touch z (ruling out EC)
- Overlap with z (ruling out PO)
- Contain z (ruling out TPPi and NTPPi)
- Be contained by z (ruling out TPP and NTPP)
- Be equal to z (ruling out EQ)

The only possible relationship is that x and z are completely disconnected.
