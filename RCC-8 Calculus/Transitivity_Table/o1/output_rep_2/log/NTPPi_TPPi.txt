PROMPT: If NTPPi(x,y) and TPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

### Answer: NTPPi(x,z)

Explanation (informal):  
• NTPPi(x,y) means y is a non-tangential proper part of x (i.e., y < x with no shared boundary).  
• TPPi(y,z) means z is a tangential proper part of y (i.e., z < y and z’s boundary touches y’s boundary).  

Since y < x with no boundary contact between y and x, and z < y with z’s boundary touching only y’s boundary, z must also lie strictly inside x (and cannot touch x’s boundary). Therefore z is a non-tangential proper part of x, i.e., NTPPi(x,z).
