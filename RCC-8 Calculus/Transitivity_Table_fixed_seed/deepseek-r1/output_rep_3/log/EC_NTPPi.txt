PROMPT: If EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given EC(x,y) and NTPPi(y,z), the possible relationship between x and z is disconnected (DC).

- EC(x,y) means x and y touch at a boundary but share no interior parts.
- NTPPi(y,z) means NTPP(z,y), so z is a non-tangential proper part of y, meaning z is entirely within the interior of y and does not touch y's boundary.

Since z is strictly inside y and does not touch y's boundary, and x only touches y's boundary without sharing interior, x and z have no common points. Therefore, they must be disconnected (DC). No other RCC-8 relations are possible, as partial overlap, tangential connection, or equality would contradict the given relations.

### Answer:  
DC
