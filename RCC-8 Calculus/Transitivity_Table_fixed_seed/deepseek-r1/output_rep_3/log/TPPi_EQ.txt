PROMPT: If TPPi(x,y) and EQ(y,z) then what are the possible relationships between x and z?

ANSWER:

Given TPPi(x,y), which means TPP(y,x) (y is a tangential proper part of x).  
Given EQ(y,z), which means y and z are coincident (identical).  

Since y and z are identical, substituting z for y in TPP(y,x) gives TPP(z,x).  
TPP(z,x) is equivalent to TPPi(x,z) by definition.  

Therefore, the only possible relationship between x and z is TPPi(x,z).  

### Answer: TPPi(x,z)
